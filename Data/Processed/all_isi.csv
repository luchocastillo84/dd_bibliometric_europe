POLICY,ARTICLE,NA,INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY,"THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION IS NOW A POLITICAL ORTHODOXY SEEN BY MANY POLITICIANS AND EDUCATORS AS A READY MEANS OF WIDENING PARTICIPATION TO THOSE SOCIAL GROUPS TRADITIONALLY EXCLUDED FROM LEARNING. HOWEVER THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN OVERCOMING SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN EDUCATION AND LIFETIME LEARNING PRACTICES HAS OFTEN FAILED TO BE OBJECTIVELY DISCUSSED WITH A TENDENCY FOR MANY EDUCATIONALISTS TO ADOPT EITHER OVERTLY OPTIMISTIC OR PESSIMISTIC POSITIONS. FROM THIS BACKGROUND THE PRESENT ARTICLE OBJECTIVELY EXAMINES BOTH CURRENT PATTERNS OF EXCLUSION FROM EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY ALONGSIDE THE RANGE OF ONGOING POLICIES AND INITIATIVES ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES CONCERNED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATION. MOREOVER BASED ON A RANGE OF NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN RESEARCH LITERATURE CONCERNED WITH PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION, THE ARTICLE THEN DISCUSSES THE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS FACED BY U.S. EDUCATIONALISTS AND POLICY MAKERS IN PROACTIVELY USING TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS OF REDUCING SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN LIFELONG EDUCATION.","UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF, SCH SOCIAL SCI, CARDIFF CF1 1XL, S GLAM, WALES.","SELWYN, N (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF, SCH SOCIAL SCI, CARDIFF CF1 1XL, S GLAM, WALES.","BALL S J, 1999, DOI 10.1080/0305764990290203; BALNAVES M, 1997; BENT F, 1996; BROMLEY H, 1999; BRYSON M, 1994, DOI 10.2190/gv54-l06n-p3yx-h5me; BURSTALL E, 1996; CARNEVALE A, 1998; CARNEVALE A, 1998; CLINTON W, 2000; CROWLEY M, 1999; CUBVAN L, 1986; DE KERCKHOVE D, 2014; DEP E, 1999; DEP ED E, 1996; DOLOWITZ D, 2000; DRIVER M, 1994; EDWARDS R, 1993; FEVRE R, 1999, DOI 10.1080/1363908990120201; FEVRE R, 1999, DOI 10.1080/02660830.1999.11661400; FEVRE S, 1999, DOI 10.1080/0141192990250407; FIELDING A, 1998, DOI 10.1080/0305498980240405; FRAZER L, 1988; FRYER R, 1997; FURLONG J, 1998; FURTER P, 1977; GERSHUNY J, 1994; GLADIEUX L, 1999; GLENNAN T, 1996; GORARD S, 1999, DOI 10.1080/030549899103919; GORARD S, 1997; GORARD S, 1998; GORARD S, 1998; GREENHALGH C, 1987; HAND A, 1994; HARASIM L M, 1995; HARRISON R, 1993; HEDBERG J, 1992; HOLDERNESS M, 1998; INF INFR TASK F, 1993; ISTANCE D, 1995; JOHNSON R, 1993; KEEP E, 1997; KENNARD W, 2000; KENNEDY H, 1997; KERKA S, 1997; KITCHIN R, 1998; LANGDALE J, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(97)00004-9; LEWIS R, 1993; LYON D, 1988; MAGUIRE M, 1993; MCGIVNEY V, 1993; MORI, 1998; NASH I, 1996; NAT TEL INF A, 1999; NEILL M, 1995; NEWMAN R, 1999, DOI 10.1080/01425699995515; NOVAK T, 1998; OFF ED T, 2000; OFF ED T, 2000; PARK A, 1994; POSTMAN N, 1992; PYKE N, 1996; REES G, 1997; REES G, 1997; RESNICK D, 1997; RIEDLING A M, 1999; ROBERTS K, 1992; ROBERTSON D, 1998; ROBINS K, 1989; ROLL R, 1995; SARGANT N, 1996; SAWHNEY H, 1996, DOI 10.1177/016344396018002007; SCHRATZ M, 1996; SEALE J, 1999; SECR EL C, 1998; SELWYN N, 1999, DOI 10.1080/136911899359682; SELWYN N, 2000, DOI 10.1111/1468-2273.00153; SHACKLETON J, 1997; SLOWINSKI J, 2000; SPENDER D, 1997, DOI 10.1177/001139297045002008; SUSSMAN G, 1997; SW ED DEV L, 1995; TAN Z, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0308-5961(95)00036-4; TASKER M, 1993, DOI 10.1080/03075079312331382319; TAYLOR A, 1998, DOI 10.1080/002202798183675; TAYLOR S, 1994; TIGHT M, 1998, DOI 10.1080/0305498980240404; TITMUS C, 1994; TOULOUSE C, 1997; VOLTI R, 1992; WINNER L, 1997; WRESCH W, 1996; ZUBOFF S, 1988",42,2001,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000168237800002,ISI,UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,UNIV WALES COLL CARDIFF,NA,"SELWYN N, 2001, EDUC POLICY","SELWYN N, 2001, EDUC POLICY",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/0895904801015002002,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,42,CORWIN PRESS INC A SAGE PUBLICATIONS CO,NA,WOS

ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE NOW AN ESTIMATED 304 MILLION GLOBAL INTERNET USERS, AN INCREASE OF 78 PERCENT FROM 1999 [2]. ANOTHER APPRECIABLE TREND IS WHO IS USING THE INTERNET AND FROTH WHERE. RECENTLY RELEASED RESEARCH FOUND THAT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA NOW ACCOUNT FOR LESS THAN 50 PERCENT OF TOTAL USER GROWTH [2], THIS IS A TREND THAT MOST RESEARCHERS BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE DURING THE NEXT DECADE. THIS BELIEF IS ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM. THE WEF TASK FORCE ON THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE INITIATIVE ISSUED A REPORT TO THE KYUSHU-OKINAWA G-8 SUMMIT IN JUNE DISCLOSING RESEARCH AND SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTION. THE WEF REPORT NOTED THAT ""MARKET-ORIENTED POLICY REFORMS, LOCAL ENTREPRENEURIAL EFFORTS AND THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAVE COMBINED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE DEPLOYMENT AND USABILITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INTERNET AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES IN MANY COUNTRIES ACROSS ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST"" [3]. IT IS APPARENT THAT DESIGN PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. THE ITALIAN DESIGNER LIDIA GUIBERT FERRARA NOTED THAT, ""THE GOAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL DESIGN IS TO RESPECT THE SUBTLETIES OF ONE'S AUDIENCE, AN EFFORT THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT QUESTIONING OF BOTH THE DESIGNER'S PERSONAL BELIEFS AND THE TROUBLING MISCONCEPTIONS THAT MIGHT BE LURKING IN THE ASSIGNMENT"" [4].

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN DIGITAL LIBRARIES DO NOT ONLY REQUIRE SOPHISTICATED ICT, THEY ALSO CALL FOR HUGE INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF MONEY AND INTELLECTUAL RESOURCES.

AS A RESULT, USERS IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD ARE BEING DEPRIVED OF DIGITAL LIBRARY SERVICES. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT SOME RECENT GLOBAL DIGITAL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENTS CAN BE USED BY USERS IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES : SUBJECT GATEWAYS, DIGITAL REFERENCE SERVICES, FREE ACCESS TO A JOURNALS AND E-BOOKS IN MANY AREAS, E-PRINT ARCHIVES AND FREE DIGITAL LIBRARIES.

BROUSSEAU E,E-COMMERCE IN FRANCE: DID EARLY ADOPTION PREVENT ITS DEVELOPMENT?,INFORMATION SOCIETY,INF. SOC.,ARTICLE,DIFFUSION OF INNOVATION; DIGITAL DIVIDE; E-COMMERCE; INTERNET ADOPTION,NA,"FRANCE'S EARLY ADOPTION OF MINITEL AND EDI IN THE 1980S WAS BOTH A STIMULUS AND AN INHIBITOR TO INTERNET-BASED E-COMMERCE. IT HINDERED THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERNET, BUT IT ALSO CREATED THE CONDITIONS FOR A RAPID CATCH UP WHEN FRANCE SWITCHED TO THE INTERNET IN 1997. THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY OPEN TO THE USE OF IT, A DENSE NETWORK OF ONLINE SPECIALISTS AND INFORMATION SERVICE PROVIDERS ALREADY EXISTED, AND MANY INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO GO DIGITAL WERE ALREADY MADE. ON THE OTHER HAND, BY MID-2001 FRANCE WAS STILL FAR BEHIND THE EARLY ADOPTERS OF E-COMMERCE OVER THE INTERNET. THIS IS BECAUSE THE FRENCH CATCH-UP WAS CHECKED BY THE IMPLOSION OF THE INTERNET FINANCIAL BUBBLE IN 2000. SECOND, MANY INTERNET-BASED BUSINESS MODELS DID NOT FIT THE FRENCH DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE DIFFERENCES SUGGEST THAT E-COMMERCE PATHS OF DEVELOPMENT CAN BE DIFFERENTIATED AMONG NATIONS, BECAUSE BOTH NEEDS AND SOLUTIONS DIFFER. THIS CONCLUSION GOES AGAINST THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT E-COMMERCE WILL LEAD TO THE EMERGENCE OF AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL MARKETPLACE IN WHICH COMMON COMMERCIAL PRACTICES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.","UNIV PARIS 10, FORUM, F-92001 NANTERRE, FRANCE.; IUF, PARIS, FRANCE.","BROUSSEAU, E (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV PARIS 10, FORUM, BATIMENT K,200 AVE REPUBL, F-92001 NANTERRE, FRANCE.","BENCHM G, 2000; BROUSSEAU E, 1994, DOI 10.1016/0167-6245(94)90007-8; BROUSSEAU E, 1996; BROUSSEAU E, 2000, DOI 10.3406/estat.2000.7483; BROUSSEAU E, 1991; BROUSSEAU E, 2002; BROUSSEAU E, 2002; BUR INF PREV E, 2000; EUR SURV INF S, 2000; EUROPEAN C, 2001; FEUVRIER P, 2000; FLICHY P, 1991; FORR RES I, 2000; GENSOLLEN M, 2001; GREENAN N, 1999; HEITZMANN R, 2001; INT DAT C, 2002; INT DAT C, 2000; INT TEL U, 2001; LICOPPE C, 2001; MATHONNET P, 2002; MOATI P, 2001; MORTON F, 2000; OBS COMM ECH E, 1999; ORG EC COOP D, 2000; RALLET A, 2001; SERV ET STAT I, 2001; SERV ET STAT I, 2001; SHAPIRO C, 1999; TAYL NELS S, 2000",18,2003,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000180801800005,ISI,,NOTDECLARED,NA,"BROUSSEAU E, 2003, INF SOC","BROUSSEAU E, 2003, INF SOC",FRANCE;FRANCE,10.1080/01972240309473,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,18,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,WOS
JAMES J,FREE SOFTWARE AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE,J. INF. SCI.,ARTICLE,NA,NA,"OUR FOCUS IN THIS PAPER IS MAINLY ON THE GNU/LINUX OPERTING SYSTEM AND THE ADVANTAGES THAT IT AFFORDS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SEEKING TO BRIDGE THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THE PAPER WE ARGUE THAT, ALTHOUGH GNU/LINUX CAN GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS WHEN USED INSTEAD OF THE PROPRIETARY ALTERNATIVE, IN NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS, THE MOST TELLING OPPORTUNITIES-FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARISE WHEN THIS SYSTEM IS COMBINED. WITH OTHER WAYS OF REDUCING COMPUTING COSTS. POLICY, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT ONLY CONSIST OF SUBSTITUTING GNU/LINUX FOR PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE IN RUNNING THE LATEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE HARDWARE, BUT ALSO OF LOWERING THESE LATTER COSTS THEMSELVES. LATER SECTIONS FOCUS ON THE LINK BETWEEN THE CHOICE OF SOFTWARE AND PATH-DEPENDENCY (I.E. THE NOTION THAT IF ONE SYSTEM GETS AHEAD, IT TENDS TO LOCK OUT ALTERNATIVES IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED BY BRIAN ARTHUR). WE SUGGEST THAT THE PROBLEM OF PROPRIETARY LOCK-IN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAS BEEN GREATLY ACCENTUATED BY PIRACY OF MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEMS AND THAT THE RESULT IS A STAGNATION OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES IN SOFTWARE THAT THESE COUNTRIES NEED SO BADLY.","TILBURG UNIV, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","JAMES, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KATHOLIEKE UNIV BRABANT, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","6 ANN BUS SOFTW A, 2001; ARTHUR W B, 1988; ARTHUR W B, 1996; BABU S, 2001; HALL S, 2000; HILLS J, 2001; JAMES J, 2001; LALL S, 1992; LETTICE J, 2002; MURRAY D, 1999; POLLOCK H, 2000; SCHEERES J, 2001; STERLING B, 2001; WACHIRA N, 2001",9,2003,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000181414100003,ISI,TILBURG UNIV,KATHOLIEKE UNIV BRABANT,NA,"JAMES J, 2003, J INF SCI","JAMES J, 2003, J INF SCI",NETHERLANDS,10.1177/016555150302900103,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE",9,BOWKER-SAUR,NA,WOS

SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND HAD A DIRECT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPUTER EXPERIENCE AND AN INDIRECT NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPUTER ANXIETY. THE PATTERN OF RELATIONSHIPS WAS HELD OVER AND ABOVE THE VARIANCE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE SET OF CONTROL VARIABLES THAT INCLUDED, AMONG OTHERS, COMPUTER ACCESS AND SEX.

SUCH A VIEW OF THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, IGNORES THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF WAYS IN WHICH POOR, ILLITERATE PERSONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BENEFIT FROM THE INTERNET WITHOUT ANY USE OF COMPUTERS AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. MOST OF THESE BENEFITS OCCUR AS A RESULT OF INTERMEDIARIES WHO, IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, TRANSFER RELEVANT PARTS OF THE KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE FROM THE TECHNOLOGY TO RECIPIENTS IN A FORM THAT IS RELEVANT TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS. USING INDIA AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS ARGUMENT, WE FIND THAT USAGE UNDERSTATES ACTUAL BENEFICIARIES BY AT LEAST 30 PERCENT. ON THE BASIS OF THIS FINDING, WE SUGGEST THAT A RECONSTRUED NOTION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BE BASED ON USAGE AS WELL AS OTHER MORE INDIRECT FORMS OF BENEFIT FROM THE INTERNET IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE WTO, OECD AND UNCTAD, AS WELL AS THE USA AND EU, TRADE IN E-COMMERCE IS ALSO A MEANS OF IMPROVING THE OVERALL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE OF LESS DEVELOPED NATIONS. IN FACT, THE WTO CONSIDERS E-COMMERCE TO BE THE KEY FORCE IN INTEGRATING LDCS INTO THE MULTILATERAL TRADING SYSTEM. THIS PAPER SETS OUT TO PROBLEMATIZE THIS VIEW, NOT BY ARGUING THAT E-COMMERCE CANNOT MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO DEVELOPMENT, BUT BY QUERYING THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT UNDERPIN CURRENT THINKING. WE START BY REPAIRING THESE DEFECTS: THE ABSENCE OF ANY ROLE FOR THE STATE; THE UNDERESTIMATION OF POLARIZATION IN SOCIETY AND ITS EFFECT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH; AND THE FAILURE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN TYPES OF E-COMMERCE. EMPLOYING THE PARTICIPATION AND ENHANCEMENT CLASSIFICATION OF E-COMMERCE ADOPTION, WE CONSIDER WHETHER DEVELOPING STATES ARE READY FOR THE PARTICIPATION PHASE OF E-COMMERCE, IF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE THE KINDS OF INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT ACT AS DEMAND-PULL SECTORS FOR E-COMMERCE GROWTH, AND WHETHER SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN PLACE TO ENCOURAGE AND SUSTAIN E-COMMERCE.","UNIV BATH, SCH MANAGEMENT, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND.","LUND, MJF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV BATH, SCH MANAGEMENT, BATH BA2 7AY, AVON, ENGLAND.","AGHION P, 2002, DOI 10.1093/oxrep/18.3.306; AMSDEN A, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0305-750x(96)00124-6; BALASSA B, 1981; BLATTMAN C, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390241475; BOOTH A, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0305-750x(98)00126-0; CECCHINI S, 2003, DOI 10.1002/itdj.1590100203; CHHIBBER N, 2004; COCO A, 2004, DOI 10.1080/01972240490269997; DARLEY W K, 2003, DOI 10.1002/itdj.1590100102; DAY G, 2003, DOI 10.2307/41166169; DE ROY O, 1997; FORMAN C, 2002; FORMAN C, 2003; GLAESER EDWARD L, 2004; GOLDSTEIN A, 2000; ISMAIL M M, 2000; KAPUR D, 2001, DOI 10.5465/ame.2001.4614831; KEEFER P, 2003; KIM C, 1992, DOI 10.1016/0305-750x(92)90094-c; KUTHIALA K, 2003; LAL K, 2001, DOI 10.1080/019722401750175649; LAL K, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00014-1; LAWTON T, 2003, DOI 10.1007/978-3-663-01562-8_4; MAHADEVAN B, 2003, DOI 10.2307/41166233; MAIN L, 2001, DOI 10.1080/713701143; MALAWER S, 2001; MCINTYRE A, 2002; MINGES M, 2000; MOODLEY S, 2002, DOI 10.1080/03768835022000019338; MOODLEY S, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1540-627x.00085; NELSON R, 2003, DOI 10.1080/09692290310001601885; NICHOLAS K, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227868; NOOTEBOOM B, 1999; OECD, 2004; OECD, 2002; ORDANINI A, 2005, DOI 10.2307/41166297; PANAGARIYA A, 2000, DOI 10.1111/1467-9701.00313; SAANEN Y, 1999, DOI 10.1080/101967899359085; SAWY O, 2003; STOLER A, 2001; TINAWI E, 2002; TSUI-AUCH L, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0170840603024004001; UNCTAD, 2004; UNCTAD, 2004; US DEP C, 2004; US DEP S, 2000; WADE R, 2002, DOI 10.1163/19426720-00804005; WOLCOTT P, 2003; WORLD B, 2004; WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (, 1998; WUNSCHVINCENT S, 2001; WUNSCHVINCENT S, 2002",15,2005,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000234050200002,ISI,UNIV BATH,UNIV BATH,NA,"LUND MJF, 2005, NA","LUND MJF, 2005, NA",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/0170840605059149,NA,MANAGEMENT,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,NA,WOS

THE MANY VIEWS ON THE 'DIGITAL DIVIDE' ARE PRESENTED HERE AS FOUR DISTINCT APPROACHES DIFFERING FROM EACH OTHER IN CONTEXT AND DEFINITION: THE TECHNOCRATIC APPROACH; THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE APPROACH; THE INFORMATION STRUCTURE AND EXCLUSION APPROACH; AND MODERNIZATION AND CAPITALISM. THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE DISCOURSES ARE EXPLAINED AND EVALUATED. THE ROLE OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES IS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED AND A TENTATIVE CONCLUSION DRAWN ON THE ISSUE OF CULTURAL DIFFERENTIATION AS AGAINST SOCIAL SEGREGATION IN A CONTEXT OF A TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED NORDIC COUNTRY.

REV.,ARTICLE; PROCEEDINGS PAPER,NA,INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; COMPUTERS; WOMEN,"IN MODERN SOCIETIES, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE INDICATES THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY. TO ANALYSE THIS CONCEPT WE STUDY CAUSES OF PRIVATE COMPUTER AND INTERNET ACCESS WITH A THREE-FOLD MODEL INCLUDING HUMAN CAPITAL, FAMILY CONTEXT AND SOCIAL CONTEXT. THE 1997, 2001, AND 2003 GERMAN SOCIO-ECONOMIC PANEL WAVES CONTAIN DATA ON PRIVATE COMPUTER AND INTERNET USE, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON PAST AND PRESENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. IN 2003, MEMBERSHIP OF TECHNICAL GENERATIONS AND ETHNIC BACKGROUND TO A LARGE EXTENT DETERMINED THE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. BY ILLUSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND FAMILY CONTEXT WE ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCES FOUND FOR COMPUTER AND INTERNET USE. EFFECTS OF INCOME, GENDER, AND LIVING IN A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD ARE SIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT SOME OF THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THE 40-YEAR GERMAN SEPARATION ARE DIMINISHING WITH REGARD TO COMPUTER USE. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT HUMAN AND SOCIAL CAPITAL ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ECONOMIC CAPITAL IN EXPLAINING PRIVATE COMPUTER AND INTERNET USE.

THE SO-CALLED DIGITAL DIVIDE IS AS MUCH A SYMPTOM AND A CAUSE OF THESE BROADER TECHNO-ECONOMIC PHENOMENA, AND REGARDING IT AS A SIMPLE ISSUE OF CONNECTIVITY IS SIMPLISTIC AND REDUCTIVE.","UNIV OSLO, CTR TECHNOL INNOVAT & CULTURE, TIK, N-0317 OSLO, NORWAY.","PARAYIL, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OSLO, CTR TECHNOL INNOVAT & CULTURE, TIK, POB 1108, N-0317 OSLO, NORWAY.","AGHION P, 1998; AHLUWALIA M, 1976, DOI 10.1016/0304-3878(76)90027-4; ANTONELLI C, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(02)00093-8; ARTHUR W, 1994; ARTHUR W, 1998; AUTOR D, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555874; BERMAN E, 1994, DOI 10.2307/2118467; BERMAN E, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555892; BRAITHWAITE J, 2000; BRENNER Y, 1991; BRESNAHAN T, 1997; BURNETTE J, 1995; CASELLI F, 1999, DOI 10.1257/aer.89.1.78; CASTELLS M, 2009; DAVIS S, 1991; DE LA MOTHE J, 2004; DRAHOS P, 1995, DOI 10.1080/01972243.1995.9960193; DRAHOS P, 2002; DRAHOS P, 2003; FRANK R, 1995; FRIEDMAN TH L, 2000; GORDON D, 1996; HEMPEL CARL G, 1965; JAMES J, 2001, DOI 10.1080/09692290010010281; KRUEGER A, 1993, DOI 10.2307/2118494; KUHN T, 1970; KUZNETS S, 1955; LAYTON E, 1974, DOI 10.2307/3102759; LINDERT P, 1995; LOADER B, 1998; LUCAS H, 2003, DOI 10.1080/0810902032000050983; LUNDVALL B, 1992; MADDISON A, 2003; MADDISON A, 2001; MADDISON A, 1982; MANSFIELD E, 1985; MOKYR J, 1990; PARAYIL G, 1999; PERALTA G, 2003; PIKETTY T, 2003, DOI 10.1162/00335530360535135; POSTER M, 1997; REICH R, 1991; SACHS J, 2001; SMITH C, 2002; STIROH K, 2002, DOI 10.1257/000282802762024638; STOLL C, 1995; SUTCLIFFE B, 2004, DOI 10.1093/oxrep/grh002; THOMPSON G, 2002; WIDER, 2000; WOLFF E, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00068-3; WOOD A, 1995, DOI 10.1257/jep.9.3.57",66,2005,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000226230000003,ISI,UNIV OSLO,UNIV OSLO,NA,"PARAYIL G, 2005, INF SOC","PARAYIL G, 2005, INF SOC",NORWAY,10.1080/01972240590895900,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,67,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,WOS

COMPUT.,ARTICLE,NA,NA,"THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NET NEIGHBOURS, AN ONLINE SHOPPING SCHEME THAT WIDENS INTERNET ACCESS TO OLDER PEOPLE VIA VOLUNTEER TELEPHONE INTERMEDIARIES. IT OUTLINES THE PROCESSES OF: PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION, DESIGNING THE TELEPHONE INTERACTION, THE FINANCIAL MODEL AND THE INTERFACE FOR THE VOLUNTEER. IT DESCRIBES THE APPLICATION AND ADAPTATION OF HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION (HCI) TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL CHARITY THAT CO-DEVELOPED THE SCHEME. THE PAPER BEGINS BY REPORTING THE ETHNOGRAPHIC WORK THAT LED TO THE SCHEME; IT THEN DESCRIBES THE PILOT STUDY CONDUCTED WITH AGE CONCERN, YORK. IT MAPS THE VARIOUS POSSIBLE CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE SCHEME IN A SERIES OF FINANCIAL MODELS EXPRESSED IN TREE DIAGRAMS AND GOES ON TO DESCRIBE THE USE OF PASTICHE SCENARIOS IN DEVELOPING DESIGNS. PASTICHE SCENARIOS DRAW ON FICTION AS A RESOURCE TO EXPLORE, IN AN ENGAGING MANNER, THE SOCIAL ISSUES RAISED BY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS; THE PAPER PRESENTS EXTRACTS FROM THREE SUCH SCENARIOS THAT WERE USED TO REASON ABOUT DEPENDABILITY ISSUES WITH AGE CONCERN STAFF. THE SCHEME IS ONGOING AND PLANS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MADE TO EXTEND IT BY RECRUITING UNIVERSITY STAFF AND OTHER OFFICE WORKERS AS VOLUNTEER INTERMEDIARIES. IT IS HOPED THAT THE SCHEME WILL BECOME WIDELY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE CITY AND IN OTHER LOCATIONS AROUND THE UK. IT IS ARGUED THAT VOLUNTEER TELEPHONE INTERMEDIARIES CAN BRIDGE DIGITAL DIVIDES AND MAKE INTERNET SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO THOSE EXCLUDED EITHER BY AGE, DISABILITY OR LACK OF RESOURCES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCHEME IS A CASE STUDY IN THE WAYS THAT HCI TECHNIQUES CAN BE ADOPTED AND ADAPTED IN ORDER TO DESIGN FOR CIVIL SOCIETY. (C) 2004 ELSEVIER B.V.

SCI.,ARTICLE,NA,NA,"DEFINED AS THE DIFFERENTIAL DEGREE TO WHICH RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES BENEFIT FROM NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE INTERNET, THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE IS WIDELY MEASURED BY INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WITH INDIVIDUAL ACCESS TO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES. YET, WHILE THIS MEASURE MAKES SENSE IN THE RICH COUNTRIES, WHERE INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP IS WIDESPREAD AMONG THE POPULATION, IT MAKES VERY LITTLE SENSE IN POOR COUNTRIES. FOR, IN THE LATTER, WHAT WE FIND IS THAT ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUAL ACCESS IS INDEED VERY LIMITED, A REMARKABLE NUMBER OF LOCAL INNOVATIONS ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE INTERNET ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO AT LEAST 10 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE THIRD WORLD. MANY SUCH PERSONS ARE ILLITERATE, UNSKILLED AND RESIDENT IN THE RURAL AREAS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THESE FINDINGS DIRECTLY CONTRADICT THE COMMONLY HELD NOTION THAT THERE ARE FEW, IF ANY, LOCAL INNOVATIONS IN THE APPLICATIONS OF THE INTERNET OUTSIDE THE RICH COUNTRIES AND THOSE PARTS OF POORER COUNTRIES WITH CLOSE CONNECTIONS TO THE FORMER (MOST TYPICALLY THROUGH MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS). FROM A POLICY POINT OF VIEW, WE SUGGEST THAT FOREIGN AID DONORS AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS PAY LESS ATTENTION TO PROVIDING INDIVIDUAL ACCESS FACILITIES SUCH AS SO-CALLED TELE-CENTRES AND FOCUS INSTEAD ON WAYS TO FOSTER INDIGENOUS RURAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS DEVOTED TO FINDING RELEVANT AND COST-EFFECTIVE APPLICATIONS OF THE INTERNET.","TILBURG UNIV, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","JAMES, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TILBURG UNIV, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","DEV G, 2004; ETTA F, 2003; GIRARD B, 1999; GIRARD B, 2003; HUGHES S, 2003; JAMES J, 2004, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019; JAMES J, 1979; JAYAWEERA W, 2001; MINGES M, 2002; MYRDAL G, 1968; NORONHA F, 2003; PIGATO M, 2001; PRINGLE I, 2003; RAI S, 2001; RAY D, 1998, DOI 10.1515/9781400835898; SOOD A, 2003; SOOD A, 2002; SOOD A, 2002; UNESCO, 2003; WORLD B, 2002",29,2005,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000227150600005,ISI,TILBURG UNIV,TILBURG UNIV,NA,"JAMES J, 2005, J INF SCI","JAMES J, 2005, J INF SCI",NETHERLANDS,10.1177/0165551505050788,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE",30,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,NA,WOS

IT FOCUSES ON THE WAYS IN WHICH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) UNEVENLY AFFECT THE PACE OF LIFE WITHIN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT. BASED ON A DETAILED CASE STUDY OF HOW ICTS ARE BEING USED IN AN AFFLUENT AND A MARGINALISED NEIGHBOURHOOD IN NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, THE PAPER SUGGESTS THAT URBAN DIGITAL DIVIDES NEED TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS MORE THAN UNEVEN PATTERNS OF ACCESS. THEY EMERGE IN THIS WORK AS MORE THAN THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGICAL ARTEFACTS. RATHER, IT IS ARGUED THAT DIFFERENT STYLES AND SPEEDS OF TECHNOLOGICALLY MEDIATED LIFE NOW WORK TO DEFINE URBAN SOCIO-SPATIAL INEQUALITIES. THE PAPER DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN TWO SUCH KEY STYLES AND SPEEDS. FIRST, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT AFFLUENT AND PROFESSIONAL GROUPS NOW USE NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES PERVASIVELY AND CONTINUOUSLY AS THE 'BACKGROUND' INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUSTAIN PRIVILEGED AND INTENSELY DISTANCIATED, BUT TIME-STRESSED, LIFESTYLES. SECONDLY, MORE MARGINALISED NEIGHBOURHOODS TEND TO BE CHARACTERISED BY INSTRUMENTAL AND EPISODIC ICT USAGE PATTERNS WHICH ARE OFTEN COLLECTIVELY ORGANISED THROUGH STRONG NEIGHBOURHOOD TIES.

THIS ARTICLE MAKES AN INVENTORY OF YEARS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH (2000-2005). THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON THREE QUESTIONS. (1) TO WHAT TYPE OF INEQUALITY DOES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CONCEPT REFER? (2) WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THE INEQUALITY OF ACCESS TO AND USE OF ICTS AS COMPARED TO OTHER SCARCE MATERIAL AND IMMATERIAL RESOURCES? (3) DO NEW TYPES OF INEQUALITY EXIST OR RISE IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY? THE RESULTS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH ARE CLASSIFIED UNDER FOUR SUCCESSIVE TYPES OF ACCESS: MOTIVATIONAL, PHYSICAL, SKILLS AND USAGE. A SHIFT OF ATTENTION FROM PHYSICAL ACCESS TO SKILLS AND USAGE IS OBSERVED. IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL ACCESS THE DIVIDE SEEMS TO BE CLOSING IN THE MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES; CONCERNING DIGITAL SKILLS AND THE USE OF APPLICATIONS THE DIVIDE PERSISTS OR WIDENS. AMONG THE SHORTCOMINGS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH ARE ITS LACK OF THEORY, CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, QUALITATIVE RESEARCH AND LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER B.V.

THIS STUDY PITS THE DISAPPEARING DIGITAL DIVIDE APPROACH AGAINST THE EMERGING DIGITAL DIFFERENTIATION APPROACH AND EMPIRICALLY TESTS THE VALIDITY OF THEIR PREDICTIONS REGARDING ADOLESCENTS' INTERNET USE AND THEIR TENDENCY TOWARDS UBIQUITOUS INTERNETTING. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF A SURVEY OF 749 DUTCH ADOLESCENTS AGED 13-18 SHOWED THAT ADOLESCENTS' UNEQUAL ACCESS TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND COGNITIVE RESOURCES SHAPED THEIR USE OF THE INTERNET AS AN INFORMATION AND AN ENTERTAINMENT MEDIUM. ADOLESCENTS WITH GREATER SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND COGNITIVE RESOURCES USED THE INTERNET MORE FREQUENTLY FOR INFORMATION AND LESS OFTEN FOR ENTERTAINMENT THAN THEIR PEERS WITH FEWER SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND COGNITIVE RESOURCES. WE FOUND A SIMILAR PATTERN REGARDING ADOLESCENTS' TENDENCY TOWARDS UBIQUITOUS INTERNETTING. THE FINDINGS TENTATIVELY SUGGEST THAT THE EMERGING DIGITAL DIFFERENTIATION APPROACH DESCRIBES CURRENT DIGITAL DIVIDE PHENOMENA MORE ADEQUATELY THAN THE DISAPPEARING DIGITAL DIVIDE APPROACH.

HOWEVER, SOME RESEARCHERS CALL THIS ASSUMPTION INTO QUESTION. MOREOVER, THE DOMINANT FOCUS ON SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS HAS LED TO A RELATIVE NEGLECT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AS POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR DIFFERENTIAL ADOPTION AND USE OF ICT.

WE IDENTIFIED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TUTEES' IMMIGRATION STATUS AND TRAINING GROUP. THESE RESULTS ARE INTERPRETED ON THE BASIS OF (1) THE TUTEES' ATTITUDES TOWARDS ADOLESCENT AND ADULT TEACHERS, AND (2) THE INSTRUCTIONAL STYLES OF ADOLESCENT AND ADULT TUTORS. FINALLY, THE ADOLESCENTS' SELF-ESTEEM INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. (C) 2006 ELSEVIER LTD.

FOR SOME RESEARCHERS, THE DIVIDE IS NOT A PROBLEM AND INTERNET ACCESS IS THE ONLY RELEVANT DETERMINANT OF INTERNET USE (ACCESS DIVIDE).

THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN EUROPE'S RURAL ENTERPRISES. USING LOGIT ANALYSIS, WE EXAMINE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE UPTAKE OF ICTS OF 996 INNOVATIVE FIRMS FROM 10 EUROPEAN RURAL REGIONS. ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE DIVIDE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO NORTH-SOUTH DIFFERENCES, NATIONAL OR EVEN REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION TO ARRIVE AT A MORE MEANINGFUL AND COMPLETE TYPOLOGY OF THE PHENOMENON. HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT SPATIAL ATTRIBUTES PROVIDE A MORE OR LESS STATIC VIEW OF THE PHENOMENON. SECTORAL, FIRM SIZE, AS WELL AS NETWORK INTENSITY, TO MENTION ONLY A FEW, CONSIDERATIONS, COULD ALLOW US A GREATER UNDERSTANDING, NOT ONLY OF CAUSES, BUT ALSO OF PROCESSES LEADING TO THE ALLEVIATION, AND QUITE OFTEN THE PERMEATING OF THE DIVIDE. NEVERTHELESS, IT APPEARS THAT AMONG THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE UPTAKE OF ICTS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HUMAN CAPITAL ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ONES.

RURAL CITIZENS STAND TO GAIN MORE THAN MOST, RELATIVELY, SINCE THE USE OF THE INTERNET REDUCES, IF NOT REMOVES, FORMER BARRIERS (PARTICULARLY THAT OF DISTANCE) TO SUCH INTERACTION. TO THAT EXTENT, THE SHRINKING OF THE 'DIGITAL DIVIDE' (AND PARTICULARLY THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF BROADBAND INTERNET IN THE COUNTRYSIDE) IS VERY WELCOME. HOWEVER, THERE IS A DANGER THAT NON-USERS OF THE INTERNET ARE DISENFRANCHISED BY SUCH DEVELOPMENTS, AND THESE INCLUDE SOME OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED AND VULNERABLE SECTORS OF RURAL POPULATIONS. THERE IS THUS A RISK THAT, AS THE INTERNET INCREASINGLY BECOMES REGARDED AS THE DEFAULT COMMUNICATION MEDIUM, A MINORITY BECOMES PROGRESSIVELY DISADVANTAGED, FIRST IN RELATIVE AND THEN IN ABSOLUTE TERMS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE LINKS BETWEEN DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN A RURAL CONTEXT, TO IDENTIFY THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF THIS 'DIGITAL VICIOUS CYCLE', AND TO CONSIDER THE OPTIONS FOR AMELIORATING THESE CONSEQUENCES.

CHALLENGES EXIST IN VARIOUS ASPECTS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A ROBUST AND SERVICE-ORIENTED NETWORK, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, APPLICATION SCENARIOS, AUTO-CONFIGURATION, ROUTING, QOS, SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION, POWER SUPPLY, HARDWARE SELECTION AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, BUSINESS MODEL ETC. FOLLOWING A GENERAL VISION OF THE PROJECT, TWO KEY ASPECTS, I.E. ROUTING AND QOS, ARE PRESENTED IN MORE DETAILS IN THIS PAPER.","POLITECN TORINO, DIPARTIMENTO AUTOMAT & INFORMAT, I-10129 TURIN, ITALY.;  UNIK UNIV GRAD CTR, N-2027 KJELLER, NORWAY.;  UNIV PATRAS, DEPT PHYS, ELECT LAB, GR-26110 PATRAS, GREECE.;  EMISFERA SOC COOPERAT, I-28900 FONDOTOCE, ITALY.","BUCCIOL, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), POLITECN TORINO, DIPARTIMENTO AUTOMAT & INFORMAT, I-10129 TURIN, ITALY.","AKYILDIZ I, 2005; CLAUSEN T, 2003; DIXIT S, 2007; IEEE, 2006; LESCHIUTTA L, 2006; LI F, 2006",6,2007,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000259362700056,ISI,POLITECN TORINO;UNIK UNIV GRAD CTR;UNIV PATRAS,P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"BUCCIOL P, 2007, NA","BUCCIOL P, 2007, NA",GREECE;ITALY;ITALY;NORWAY,978-1-4244-2024-7,978-1-4244-2024-7,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC; TELECOMMUNICATIONS",6,IEEE,SIXTH FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION [IST-2004-026548],WOS

GAMAGE P; HALPIN E,E-SRI LANKA: BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE,ELECTRONIC LIBRARY,ELECTRON. LIBR.,ARTICLE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS; COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; SRI LANKA; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,NA,"PURPOSE - THE OVERALL AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF E-SRI LANKA'S TELECENTRE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME IN BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - A SURVEY RESEARCH METHOD WAS USED IN THE STUDY TO COLLECT QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL TELECENTRE USERS IN RELEVANT COMMUNITIES. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT THROUGH A SURVEY. THE PRIMARY SAMPLE COMPRISED OF 30 PERCENT OF THE TELECENTRES. THE SECONDARY SAMPLE INCLUDED USERS AND POTENTIAL USERS AROUND THE TELECENTRES. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF USERS AND POTENTIAL USERS WAS 338. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FROM EARLY JANUARY 2005 TO THE OF END FEBRUARY 2006. FINDINGS - THE SURVEY DATA DISCLOSED THAT STILL ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION ARE AWARE OF TELECENTRES AND USE THE FACILITIES OFFERED BY THEM. THE CRUCIAL FACTOR AFFECTING USAGE IS LANGUAGE. ACCORDING TO THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS, AS THEY UNDERSTAND ONLY NATIVE LANGUAGES THEY HAVE NOT BENEFITED FROM SERVICES SUCH AS LIKE THE INTERNET AND E-MAIL. THE CONTENT OR THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE OFFERED THROUGH TELECENTRES PLAYS A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THIS REGARD. OUT OF THE 70 PERCENT OF RURAL POPULATION, THE MAJORITY ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. THEREFORE, SINHALA- AND TAMIL-SPEAKING PEOPLE ARE DISADVANTAGED. THE SURVEY DATA CONFIRMS THAT ALL TELECENTRES ARE HIGHLY (100 PER CENT) DEPENDENT ON SUBSIDIES PROVIDED BY ICTA. HENCE, THE SUSTAINABILITY OF TELECENTRES IS QUESTIONABLE AT PRESENT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE TELECENTRES SITUATED IN THE NORTH EAST REGION HAD TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY DUE TO THE RESUMPTION OF HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF SRI LANKA AND THE LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM (LTTE), AND A CORRESPONDING LACK OF ACCESS AND SECURITY IN THE REGION. THE NORTH EAST PROVINCE CONTAINS 9.84 PER CENT OF TELECENTRES SET UP UNDER THE PROJECT. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY WILL HELP POLICY MAKERS, DECISION MAKERS AND DONORS TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE KEY ISSUES SUCH AS CONNECTIVITY, ACCESSIBILITY, CONTENT AND SERVICES, SUSTAINABILITY, SKILLS DEVELOPMENT, PARTNERSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. FURTHER, THE PROBLEMS AND SUCCESSES IDENTIFIED BY THE STUDY WILL BE USEFUL FOR POLICY AND DECISION MAKERS TO ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE TELECENTRES AND HOW THE E-SRI LANKA INITIATIVE AND ESPECIALLY THE 1,000 TELECENTRE PROJECT COULD BE USED TO NARROW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SRI LANKA. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THIS WILL BE THE FIRST IN-DEPTH STUDY ON THE TELECENTRES, WHICH ARE ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S E-SRI LANKA INITIATIVE. THE FINDINGS AND METHODS USED TO ANALYSE THE DATA WILL BE RELEVANT TO FUTURE STUDIES OF COMMUNITY-BASED ICT INITIATIVES AND THE BROADER AREAS OF INFORMATION-SEEKING, INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR, AND USER NEEDS.","INST POLICY STUDIES, COLOMBO, SRI LANKA.;  LEEDS METROPOLITAN UNIV, LESLIE SILVER INT FAC, LEEDS LS1 3HE, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.","GAMAGE, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST POLICY STUDIES, COLOMBO, SRI LANKA.","BOWDEN P, 2003; CENTR BANK SRI L, 2004; DEP CENS STAT S, 2004; ETTA F, 2002; GARTN G, 2000; GOVT SRI L, 2002; INF COMM TECHN A, 2004; INF COMM TECHN A, 2004; INF COMM TECHN A, 2004; JENSEN M, 1998; JORGE S, 2002; JOSEPH L, 1999; KAI S, 2001; KENISTON K, 2003; KUMAR A, 2001; MANONUKUL A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.ijplas.2003.12.005; MARQUEZ H, 2003; MIN EC REF SCI T, 2003; NAT TEL INF A, 1999; NORRIS P, 2003; OESTMANN S, 2001; SENTHILKUMARAN S, 2003; SIBTHORPE C, 2000; UN DEV P, 2004; UN EC SOC COMM A, 2002; WATTEGAMA C, 2004; WORLD B, 1998",22,2007,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000252560900005,ISI,INST POLICY STUDIES;LEEDS METROPOLITAN UNIV,INST POLICY STUDIES,NA,"GAMAGE P, 2007, ELECTRON LIBR","GAMAGE P, 2007, ELECTRON LIBR",UNITED KINGDOM;SRI LANKA,10.1108/02640470710837128,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,22,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,NA,WOS

WE FOCUS ON A PRIVATE-PUBLIC TRAINING INITIATIVE AND ITS IMPACT ON THE SOCIALLY EXCLUDED, SPECIFICALLY LONE WOMEN PARENTS. NARRATIVE DATA FROM FOUR UNITED KINGDOM EDUCATIONAL SITES PARTICIPATING IN THIS COMPUTER NETWORK ENGINEER TRAINING PROGRAM HIGHLIGHT A SYSTEMIC PARADOX: THAT ICT SKILLS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT LONE WOMEN PARENTS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY WORKING IN OPPOSITION TO BROADER POLICY GOALS SUCH AS WORK-LIFE BALANCE AND IRONICALLY SERVE TO REPRODUCE THE PARTICIPANTS' CLASSIFICATION AS SOCIALLY EXCLUDED. THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERPINNING THE MODEL OF SOCIAL INCLUSION DRIVING THE ICT SKILLS TRAINING COURSE ARE ANALYZED CRITICALLY USING THE CONCEPTS OF COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE, CLASSIFICATORY SYSTEMS, AND MARGINALIZATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ICT TRAINING COURSES AND INITIATIVES SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN PEDAGOGIC PRACTICE THAT ACCOMMODATE THE MORE WIDE-RANGING NEEDS OF THOSE TARGETED FOR INCLUSION, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT SETTINGS.

THE INTERNET, AND IN PARTICULAR THE WORLD WIDE WEB, HAVE PROVED A POWERFUL TOOL IN BOTH THE MANIPULATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES AND THE MOBILIZATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY. MUCH IS MADE OF THE DEMOCRATIZING EFFECT OF ICTS IN E-GOVERNMENT. YET THERE ARE GOVERNMENTS THAT ATTEMPT TO CONTROL IN AN AUTHORITARIAN MANNER BOTH WHO ACCESSES THE INTERNET AND WHAT CONTENT MAY BE ACCESSED AND USED. THE QUESTION ARISES WHETHER AN INFORMATION SOCIETY AND, MORE CRITICALLY, A KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY CAN DEVELOP IN THE ABSENCE OF FREEDOM OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION, FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND FREEDOM TO ACCESS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. AGAINST THIS BROAD BACKGROUND THE AUTHORS PUT FORWARD FOUR PILLARS OF A KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY: (A) ICTS AND CONNECTIVITY, (B) CONTENT AND THE USABILITY THEREOF, (C) INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER THAN ICTS, AND (D) HUMAN CAPACITY. THEY ATTEMPT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF ACCESS AND CONTENT ON EACH OF THEM. IT IS ARGUED FROM AN ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT, WHILE A TECHNOLOGICALLY ORIENTED CONCEPT OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY MAY NOT BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH SEVERE STATE CONTROL, A MORE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY CANNOT DEVELOP UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES. FREEDOM IS FUNDAMENTAL TO PARTICIPATION IN A KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY.

TECHNOL.,ARTICLE,NA,NA,"WHILE WE NOW KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, SUCH AS INCOME, SKILLS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE, LITTLE HAS BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT HOW THESE VARIABLES RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER. YET, IT IS ON THE BASIS OF ONE'S ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION THAT THE DIFFICULTY OF CLOSING THE DIVIDE ULTIMATELY DEPENDS. IN THIS ARTICLE, I HAVE SOUGHT TO CHALLENGE THE (IMPLICIT) PREVAILING ASSUMPTION IN MOST OF THE DIGITAL-PREPAREDNESS LITERATURE THAT VARIABLES CAN BE PERFECTLY SUBSTITUTED FOR ONE ANOTHER AND, HENCE, ADDED TOGETHER. IN PARTICULAR, AND DRAWING ON AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, I VIEW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN, SAY COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER SKILLS, AS BEING NEARER THE OPPOSITE EXTREME, OF TOTALLY LIMITED SUBSTITUTABILITY. ON THIS BASIS, I SUGGEST THAT THE COMPONENTS OF DIGITAL-PREPAREDNESS INDEXES BE MULTIPLIED RATHER THAN ADDED. USING MULTIPLICATION RATHER THAN ADDITION IN MOST CURRENT INDEXES OF DIGITAL PREPAREDNESS REVEALS A SUBSTANTIAL UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE REAL DIFFICULTY IN CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND A DIFFERENT SET OF POLICIES TO DEAL WITH THIS LARGER PROBLEM. SUCH POLICIES SHOULD INCLUDE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS AND THE USE OF INTERMEDIARIES.","TILBURG UNIV, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","JAMES, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TILBURG UNIV, 2 WARANDELAAN, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","BRESNAHAN T, 2002, DOI 10.1162/003355302753399526; CAWTHERA A, 2001; ETTA F, 2002; ETTA F E, 2003; GAM L, 2003; GLASGOW R, 2006, DOI 10.1093/her/cyl081; HITT L M, 1999; INT TEL U, 2006; JAMES J, 2008, DOI 10.1002/asi.20793; JAMES J, 2007, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000097; JENSEN M, 2007; KIFLE M, 2006; KIRKMAN G, 2001; LOPES M, 2003; MESO P, 2006; MINGES M, 2005; NSENGIYUMA A, 2005; OESTMANN S, 2001; PIGATO M, 2000; SAGAR A, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0921-8009(97)00168-7; SCHWAB K, 2007; STERN D, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0921-8009(96)00103-6; STEWART F, 1977; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VANDERWERF E, 2007; WENSHENG W, 2002",11,2008,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000259455500013,ISI,TILBURG UNIV,TILBURG UNIV,NA,"JAMES J, 2008, J AM SOC INF SCI TECHNOL","JAMES J, 2008, J AM SOC INF SCI TECHNOL",NETHERLANDS,10.1002/asi.20897,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE",11,JOHN WILEY & SONS INC,NA,WOS

BASED ON A SURVEY OF 551 WOMEN, FAMILY DAY CARE PROVIDERS, WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS A PERSISTENT DIVIDE IN PC ACCESS AND USE, AS WELL AS IN PERCEIVED PC SKILLS ACCORDING TO AGE. YET, THIS DIVIDE SEEMS TO RUN LESS ALONG TRADITIONAL LINES, SUGGESTING THAT PERSONAL FACTORS PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE. MOTIVATION AND ANXIETY ARE TWO RELATED BUT DISTINCT PERSONAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE COMPUTER USE AND SKILLS IN THIS POPULATION.

WE ARGUE THAT THE IMPORTANT GEOGRAPHICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH ITALY ARE SOMETHING THAT PUBLIC POLICY SHOULD BE CONCERNED OF. A MATCHING ESTIMATOR IS USED TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, BY COMPARING THE GRANTED WITH NON-GRANTED FIRMS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ICT ADOPTION. WE ALSO FIND THAT FIRMS IN THE SOUTH ARE MORE DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC GRANTS, AND THAT DUALITY WOULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED IF SUBSIDIES WERE NOT GIVEN. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE FIRMS PREFER TRADITIONAL RATHER THAN ICT INVESTMENT, SUBSIDIES SHOULD BE SPECIFICALLY ICT ORIENTED. (C) 2008 SOCIETY FOR POLICY MODELING. PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC.

J. INFORM. SYST.,REVIEW,BOUNDARY CRITIQUE; CRITICAL SYSTEMS THINKING; DIGITAL DIVIDE; INFORMATION SYSTEMS PLANNING; INFORMATION SOCIETY; SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY; SOFT SYSTEMS METHODOLOGY (SSM); TOP,TECHNOLOGY; MANAGEMENT; THINKING; ALIGNMENT; FREEDOM; POWER; SOFT,"AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY TAKES PLACE WORLDWIDE, INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND ORGANISATIONS FACE THE CHALLENGE OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS). 'DIGITAL DIVIDES' ARE EMERGING: SOME SECTIONS OF SOCIETY ARE GAINING ACCESS TO INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGIES WHILE OTHERS ARE BEING EXCLUDED. THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE AN OVER-CONCENTRATION ON THE USE OF ICTS FOR ORGANISATIONAL PURPOSES, WITH TRADITIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS (IS) PLANNING APPROACHES LARGELY IGNORING THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE EXPRESS OUTSIDE FORMAL ORGANISATIONS. ONE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM MIGHT BE TO ADOPT A SYSTEMS APPROACH TO IS PLANNING. AT FIRST SIGHT THIS APPEARS TO BE A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE OF THE ASPIRATION OF SYSTEMS APPROACHES TO COMPREHENSIVENESS, PRESUMABLY LOOKING BEYOND ORGANISATIONAL CONCERNS. HOWEVER, A REVIEW OF TWO POPULAR SYSTEMS METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED IN IS PLANNING SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR THEIR SCOPE TO BE EQUALLY LIMITED BY ORGANISATIONAL BOUNDARIES. THERE IS A NEED TO ENHANCE THE CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE BOUNDARIES OF IS PLANNING PROCESSES, ENABLING PEOPLE TO CONSIDER FAMILY, COMMUNITY AND OTHER CONCERNS. IN THIS PAPER, WE USE THE SYSTEMS THEORY OF BOUNDARY CRITIQUE TO DERIVE A SET OF QUESTIONS TO HELP PRACTITIONERS REFLECT ON DIFFERENT POSSIBLE BOUNDARIES FOR IS PLANNING EXERCISES. THESE SHOULD BE SEEN AS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING SYSTEMS APPROACHES RATHER THAN AS A REPLACEMENT FOR THEM, ENABLING THE LATTER TO BE PRACTISED MORE CRITICALLY. WE END BY PRESENTING OUR REFLECTIONS ON USING THESE QUESTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF AN IS PLANNING PROJECT IN A COLOMBIAN UNIVERSITY.","UNIV HULL, SCH BUSINESS, CTR SYST STUDIES, KINGSTON UPON HULL HU6 7RX, N HUMBERSIDE, ENGLAND.;  INST ENVIRONM SCI & RES ESR LTD, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND.;  VICTORIA UNIV WELLINGTON, VICTORIA MANAGEMENT SCH, WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND.;  UNIV CANTERBURY, SCH SOCIOL & ANTHROPOL, CHRISTCHURCH 1, NEW ZEALAND.;  UNIV QUEENSLAND, SCH NAT & RURAL SYST MANAGEMENT, BRISBANE, QLD, AUSTRALIA.","CORDOBA, JR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV HULL, SCH BUSINESS, CTR SYST STUDIES, COTTINGHAM RD, KINGSTON UPON HULL HU6 7RX, N HUMBERSIDE, ENGLAND.","ACKOFF R, 1981; AFELE J S C, 2003; ALVESSON M, 1992; ALVESSON M, 1996; AVGEROU C, 2001, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x; AVISON D E, 1998, DOI 10.1108/09593849810218319; AVISON D E, 1990; BALL K, 2000, DOI 10.1177/0170840600213003; BANGEMANN M, 1994; BANNON L, 1997; BECK E, 2004, DOI 10.1080/01972240490481009; BENNETTS P, 2000, DOI 10.1023/a:1009594604515; CASTELLS M, 2001; CASTELLS M, 1996; CECEZ-KECMANOVIC D, 2002, DOI 10.1080/0268396022000017752; CHAMPION D, 2001, DOI 10.1080/02683960010028438; CHECKLAND P, 1998; CHECKLAND P, 1981; CHECKLAND P, 1990; CHECKLAND P, 2007; CHURCHMAN C, 1979; CHURCHMAN C, 1968; CHURCHMAN C, 1970; CHURCHMAN C, 1971; CIBORRA C, 1994; CIBORRA C, 2001; CORDOBA J, 2006, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602081; CORDOBA J, 2006, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602080; DUNLEAVY P, 2006; EVANS K, 2004, DOI 10.1057/9780230006201; FLOOD R, 1991; FLOOD R, 1991; FLOOD R, 1996; FLOOD R, 1995, DOI 10.1038/sj/jors/0460204; FUENMAYOR R, 2000, DOI 10.1023/a:1026427512292; GALLIERS B, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0963-8687(00)00023-8; GALLIERS R D, 1993, DOI 10.1016/0963-8687(93)90007-w; GALLIERS R, 2004; HABERMAS J, 1984; HABERMAS J, 1976; HAGEDOORN J, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1467-6486.00287; HAMMER M, 1995; HENDERSON J, 1999, DOI 10.1147/sj.1999.5387096; HIRSCHHEIM R, 1994, DOI 10.2307/249611; HIRSCHHEIM R, 1989, DOI 10.1145/67933.67937; HOWCROFT D, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1468-005x.00107; IVANOV K, 1991; JACKSON M, 1982; JACKSON M, 2000; JACKSON M C, 1991; JACKSON M, 2003; JACKSON M, 2003, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601630; JASPERSON J, 2002, DOI 10.2307/4132315; JERMIER J, 1998, DOI 10.2307/2393852; KEEN P G W, 1991; KLEIN H K, 2004; LEWIS P, 1994; LINSTONE H A, 1999; LYYTINEN K, 1985; LYYTINEN K, 1992; MANSELL R, 2002; MANSELL R, 2000; MENZIES H, 1996; MIDGLEY G, 1998, DOI 10.2307/3009885; MIDGLEY G, 1992, DOI 10.1007/bf01060044; MIDGLEY G, 1996, DOI 10.1007/978-0-585-34651-9_; MIDGLEY G, 1997; MIDGLEY G, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2017.08.014; MIDGLEY G, 2000, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4615-4201-8; MINGERS, 1984; MINGERS J, 1996; MINGERS J, 2005, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601945; MINGERS J, 2001, DOI 10.1287/isre.12.3.240.9709; MINGERS J, 1992; MINGERS J C, 1980; MUMFORD E, 1983; MUNRO I, 1999, DOI 10.1023/a:1022469607464; NEGROPONTE N, 1995; ORMEROD R, 2005, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601963; PEPPARD J, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2004.02.002; PERELMAN M, 1998; PICCOLI G, 2005; ROBEY D, 1999, DOI 10.1287/isre.10.2.167; SABHERWAL R, 2001, DOI 10.1287/orsc.12.2.179.10113; SALMELA H, 2000, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000339; SANTHANAM R, 2003; SCHECTER D, 1991; STRIJBOS S, 2006, DOI 10.1007/0-387-32162-4; TAYLOR M, 2002, DOI 10.1002/sres.393; ULRICH W, 1993, DOI 10.1007/bf01059480; ULRICH W, 1987, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(87)90036-1; ULRICH W, 2003, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601518; ULRICH W, 1983; ULRICH W, 1996; ULRICH W, 2000, DOI 10.1080/713693151; WALSHAM G, 2001; WARD J, 2002; WEBSTER F, 2002; WILLMOTT H, 1997; WILLMOTT H, 1993, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.1993.tb00315.x; WILSON B, 2002; WILSON B, 1984; WOODHARPER A, 1996, DOI 10.1145/227234.227244; ZUBOFF S, 1988",33,2008,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000255261200004,ISI,UNIV HULL;INST ENVIRONM SCI AND RES ESR LTD;VICTORIA UNIV WELLINGTON;UNIV CANTERBURY;UNIV QUEENSLAND,UNIV HULL,NA,"CORDOBA JR, 2008, EUR J INFORM SYST","CORDOBA JR, 2008, EUR J INFORM SYST",AUSTRALIA;UNITED KINGDOM;NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND;NEW ZEALAND,10.1057/ejis.2008.4,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; MANAGEMENT",33,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,NA,WOS

COOKE L; GREENWOOD H,"""CLEANERS DON'T NEED COMPUTERS"" : BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE WORKPLACE",ASLIB PROCEEDINGS,ASLIB PROC.,ARTICLE,COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; HIGHER EDUCATION; FURTHER EDUCATION; INFORMATION LITERACY,NA,"PURPOSE - THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO REPORT THE FINDINGS OF RESEARCH INTO THE EXTENT AND IMPACT OF RESTRICTED ACCESS BY SPECIFIC GROUPS OF STAFF TO ICT-BASED COMMUNICATIONS IN UK FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - AN EXPLORATORY APPROACH COMBINING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS. A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO ALL HEFCE-FUNDED INSTITUTIONS IN THE UK. SIX INSTITUTIONS ACTED AS CASE STUDY SITES FOR IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION USING DOCUMENTARY ANALYSIS AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. FINDINGS - LACK OF HARDWARE AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE POSED LESS OF A BARRIER THAN LACK OF ICT SKILLS, LACK OF MOTIVATION EITHER TO USE COMPUTERS OR TO GAIN ICT SKILLS, AND LINE MANAGER RESISTANCE TO STAFF USING COMPUTERS OR ACCESSING ICT TRAINING IN WORK TIME. JOB FUNCTION WAS THE FACTOR MOST ASSOCIATED WITH LACK OF ACCESS, WITH CLEANING, CATERING AND ESTATES STAFF LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS. HOWEVER, THERE WERE ALSO MANY EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICE TO EXTEND STAFF ACCESS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO ICT TRAINING. THE RESEARCH CONCLUDES THAT ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS FOR INSTITUTIONS IS TO ""WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS"" OF NON-DESK STAFF AND THEIR MANAGERS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INSTITUTIONAL COMMUNICATION STRATEGY IS IDENTIFIED AS BEING OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - PROVIDES A ""SNAPSHOT"" OF THE PREVAILING SITUATION AT THE POINT OF DATA COLLECTION RATHER THAN A LONGITUDINAL INSIGHT INTO DEVELOPMENTS IN ACCESS OVER TIME. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF STAFF ACCESS TO ICT IN UK FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION. IN ADDITION TO HIGHLIGHTING EXAMPLES OF GOOD PRACTICE FOR DISSEMINATION ACROSS THE SECTOR, THE RESEARCH PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT GAPS IN PROVISION TO INFORM THE TARGETING OF FUTURE INITIATIVES.","UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH, DEPT INFORMAT SCI, LOUGHBOROUGH, LEICS, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH, LISU, LOUGHBOROUGH, LEICS, ENGLAND.","COOKE, L (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH, DEPT INFORMAT SCI, LOUGHBOROUGH, LEICS, ENGLAND.","BECT, 2004; BOZIONELOS N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2004.07.001; CASTELLS M, 2000; COOKE L, 2006; DFES, 2005; EDVINSSON L, 1997; FEATHER JOHN P, 2013; GOLDING P, 2001, DOI 10.1111/1468-0041.00196; HEFCE, 2005; HELLAWELL S, 2001; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; MURDOCK G, 2001; NORRIS P, 2001; PHIPPS L, 2005; SERVON L, 2002; STAKE R, 1995; UCISA, 2006; WALLACH V, 2005, DOI 10.1080/21564574.2005.9635521",7,2008,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000258536700005,ISI,UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH;UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH,UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH,NA,"COOKE L, 2008, ASLIB PROC","COOKE L, 2008, ASLIB PROC",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/00012530810862473,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE",7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LIMITED,NA,WOS

THE STUDY WAS MADE DURING 2007 IN THE REGION OF WEST GOTALAND, EIGHTEEN INTERVIEWS WERE MADE WITH DIFFERENT PERSONNEL GROUPS IN THE TRAFFIC AND LEGAL DEPARTMENTS. THE INTERVIEWS ESPECIALLY FOCUSSED ON EXPERIENCE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF WORK SITUATIONS, WORK PROCESSES AND CUSTOMER SERVICES. A NEW ELECTRONIC SYSTEM FOR DEALING WITH OFFICIAL MATTERS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT THE LEGAL AUTHORITY. THEY HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED E-SERVICES FOR SECURITY GUARDS AND FOUNDATIONS. IMPLEMENTATION OF E-SERVICES FOR DRIVERS' LICENCE APPLICATIONS WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE TRAFFIC AUTHORITY. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS SOME SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES ARE BENEFITS, SUCH AS FAST, EFFICIENT TREATMENT OF E-SERVICES, FACILITATING THE HANDLING PROCESS FROM BOTH A CITIZEN'S AND AN EMPLOYEE'S PERSPECTIVE. BUT OTHER ASPECTS ARE BARRIERS, SUCH AS RISKS FOR A MORE STRESSFUL JOB, AND MORE IMPERSONAL, SLOW ROUTINES FOR MANUAL APPLICATIONS FROM CITIZENS AND AN INCREASED SCHISM AMONG DIFFERENT USER GROUPS.

REV.,ARTICLE,NA,INTERNET USE; COMMUNICATION; CHILDREN; PARENTS; ACCESS; TRENDS,"IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYSE DIGITAL DIVIDES IN TERMS OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY IN DIGITAL ACCESS AND USE PATTERNS FROM A HIERARCHICAL PERSPECTIVE. USING DATA FROM THE PROGRAMME FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ASSESSMENT (PISA) 2003 IN 30 NATIONS, WE FOCUS ON SOCIAL CLEAVAGES IN MID-ADOLESCENTS ACCESS AND USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL AND COUNTRY-LEVEL INFLUENCES. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT ADOLESCENTS FROM HIGHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND TWO-PARENT FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME. ADDITIONALLY, ADOLESCENTS FROM HIGHER-STATUS FAMILIES USE THE INTERNET MORE OFTEN FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES THAN CHILDREN FROM LOWER-STATUS FAMILIES. ADOLESCENTS FROM SINGLE-PARENT ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE HOME INTERNET ACCESS. NEVERTHELESS, THEY USE THE INTERNET MORE FREQUENTLY FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION AND PLAY COMPUTER GAMES MORE OFTEN THAN THEIR PEERS LIVING IN TWO-PARENT FAMILIES. TESTING SIMULTANEOUSLY INDIVIDUAL AND COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS SHOWS THAT A COUNTRYS LEVEL OF MODERNIZATION CAN BE SEPARATED INTO COMPOSITIONAL AND CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS. OVERALL, A COUNTRYS LEVEL OF MODERNIZATION ONLY AFFECTS WHETHER DIGITAL APPLICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE AT THE FAMILY HOME, BUT NOT HOW THEY ARE USED. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ONCE A FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, THE DIGITAL USE PATTERNS OF THEIR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN DO NOT DIFFER ACROSS NATIONS.","RADBOUD UNIV NIJMEGEN, DEPT SOCIOL, NL-6500 HE NIJMEGEN, NETHERLANDS.;  UNIV AMSTERDAM, AMSTERDAM SCH COMMUN RES, NL-1012 CX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.","NOTTEN, N (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), RADBOUD UNIV NIJMEGEN, DEPT SOCIOL, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE NIJMEGEN, NETHERLANDS.","BIMBER B, 2000; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BRONFENBRENNER U, 1979; BUCY E, 2000, DOI 10.1162/108118000568967; CHEN W, 2004; CLARK L, 2005, DOI 10.1080/07393180500312985; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; FULK J, 1993, DOI 10.2307/256641; GANZEBOOM H, 1992, DOI 10.1016/0049-089x(92)90017-b; GUILLEN M, 2005, DOI 10.1353/sof.2006.0015; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HARGITTAI E, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6; HARGITTAI E, 2002; KORUPP S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/esr/jci030; LAREAU A, 2003; LENHART A, 2005; LERNER R, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s1054-139x(02)00495-0; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2005.08.002; MARTIN S, 2004; NEGROPONTE N, 1995; NORRIS P, 2001; OECD, 2005; OECD P, 2003; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; ROE K, 2005, DOI 10.1515/comm.2005.30.1.91; ROGERS E, 1995; SAYER L, 2004, DOI 10.1086/386270; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SNIJDERS T A, 2012; UNESCO I S, 2008; VALKENBURG P, 2007, DOI 10.1037/0012-1649.43.2.267; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WORLDB, 2007",39,2009,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000270218200003,ISI,RADBOUD UNIV NIJMEGEN;UNIV AMSTERDAM,RADBOUD UNIV NIJMEGEN,NA,"NOTTEN N, 2009, EUR SOCIOL REV","NOTTEN N, 2009, EUR SOCIOL REV",NETHERLANDS;NETHERLANDS,10.1093/esr/jcn071,NA,SOCIOLOGY,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,NA,WOS

AN INDIVIDUAL LAG OCCURS IF SOCIAL STRUCTURES AND WORKING ENVIRONMENTS CHANGE MORE RAPIDLY THAN PEOPLE'S ABILITIES. A STRUCTURAL LAG OCCURS IF A MISMATCH EXISTS BETWEEN THE CHANGING CAPABILITIES OF OLDER PEOPLE AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES ON THE LABOUR MARKET.

A SURVEY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS AT 40 U.S. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS WAS CONDUCTED, ALONG WITH OBSERVATIONS AND INTERVIEWS AT SEVERAL MIDWESTERN U.S. UNIVERSITIES. FOR COMPARISON TO THE GENERAL U.S. POPULATION A NATIONWIDE TELEPHONE SURVEY WAS UNDERTAKEN. THE STUDY PRESENTS NEW DATA ON INTERNET USE AMONG MALE AND FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS, AS WELL AS TRENDS IN USE ACROSS RACIAL LINES. DATA ON NON-WHITE HISPANIC COLLEGE STUDENT USERS OF THE INTERNET PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO INTERNET USE AMONG A GROUP THAT APPEARS TO BE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE LITERATURE ON COLLEGE STUDENTS AND INTERNET USE. THE DATA ANALYSIS PRESENTS A COMPLEX PICTURE OF DIFFERENTIAL INTERNET USE ALONG GENDER LINES, ONE THAT IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING SCHOLARLY LITERATURE.

BERNHARD I,EVALUATION OF CUSTOMER CENTRE AND E-SERVICES IN A SWEDISH MUNICIPALITY WITH FOCUS ON THE CITIZENS' PERSPECTIVE,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATION,NA,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,CUSTOMER CENTRE; EVALUATION; MUNICIPALITY CITIZEN COMMUNICATION; E-SERVICE; DIGITAL DIVIDE,NA,"COMMUNICATION AND QUALITY OF SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. EVEN THOUGH THE SWEDISH MUNICIPALITIES HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF SELF-REGULATION AND FREEDOM TO ORGANIZE COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE WITH THEIR CITIZENS IN THEIR OWN WAY, THE SWEDISH GOVERNMENT HAS EXPRESSED THEIR DEMANDS OF INCREASED EXPECTATIONS BY CITING THE POTENTIAL OF E-GOVERNANCE AND HIGH QUALITY OF SERVICE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS. TO IMPLEMENT CUSTOMER CENTERS IS ONE WAY TO MEET THESE DEMANDS. THIS PAPER OFFERS A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF CONSEQUENCES FOR SWEDISH CITIZENS REGARDING THE QUALITY OF SERVICE FROM THE CITIZENS' PERSPECTIVE IN A MUNICIPALITY WHERE A NEW CUSTOMER CENTRE AND MORE E-SERVICES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND ESTABLISHED. THE MAIN RESEARCH METHOD IS QUALITATIVE BASED UPON ANALYSIS FROM TWELVE INTERVIEWS WITH DIFFERENT PERSONNEL CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY. THE RESULTS ARE ALSO BASED ON ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER INVESTIGATIONS MADE BY THE MUNICIPALITY. NO INTERVIEWS ARE MADE DIRECTLY WITH CITIZENS. THE KEY RESULTS ARE THAT THIS IMPLEMENTATION AND DEVELOPING OF E-SERVICES ARE MOSTLY POSITIVE FOR THE QUALITY OF SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS DUE TO E.G. THAT THE ACCESSIBILITY TO THE MUNICIPAL SERVICES HAS INCREASED WHICH HAS LED TO IMPROVED POSSIBILITIES TO CHOOSE THE COMMUNICATION WAY OF SERVICE FOR THE CITIZENS. ANOTHER POSITIVE RESULTS ARE THE DEVELOPING OF THE WORKING PROCESSES THAT ARE MOVED TO THE CUSTOMER CENTERS, THAT THE CITIZENS NEEDS HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED AND THAT THE MUNICIPALITY USE RESULTS OF CUSTOMER INVESTIGATIONS AND RESULTS OF DISCUSSING WITH FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDING CITIZENS IN THE DEVELOPING OF E-SERVICES TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE AND THAT THERE IS A STRIVING TOWARDS MORE DEMOCRACY AS ALL CITIZENS WILL HAVE AN EQUIVALENT TREATMENT WITH JUST ONE TELEPHONE NUMBER TO THE CUSTOMER CENTRE. BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME WEAK ASPECTS FOUND; E.G. THAT THERE CAN APPEAR A LACK OF TRUST FROM THE CITIZENS TO THE SYSTEM AS ALL CONTACTS ARE TO BE DONE THROUGH THE CUSTOMER CENTRE AND THAT THERE CAN BE A LACK OF DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH CLERKS AT THE ADMINISTRATION THAT HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISIONS. ALSO, THERE ARE CITIZENS HAVING PROBLEM USING THE TONE SELECTION WHEN CALLING TO THE CUSTOMER CENTRE.","UNIV WEST, DEPT ECON & IT, TROLLHATTAN, SWEDEN.","BERNHARD, I (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV WEST, DEPT ECON & IT, TROLLHATTAN, SWEDEN.","BALOGUN J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2005.02.010; BARRETT D, 2002, DOI 10.1108/13563280210449804; CHENEY G, 2004; FINDAHL O, 2008; FINDAHL O, 2007; GRUNDEN K, 2009; GRUNDEN K, 1992; HADENIUS S, 2008; JOHANSSON C, 2008; LEAVITT H, 1964; LEWIS L, 2000, DOI 10.1177/002194360003700201; OCASIO W, 2008",2,2009,COMPUTER SCIENCE; OPERATIONS RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,WOS:000274173600005,ISI,UNIV WEST,UNIV WEST,NA,"BERNHARD I, 2009, NA","BERNHARD I, 2009, NA",SWEDEN,978-1-906638-43-6,978-1-906638-43-6,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; OPERATIONS RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT SCIENCE",2,ACADEMIC CONFERENCES LTD,NA,WOS

TYPICAL OBJECTIVES OF ELECTRONIC VOTING ARE TO ENHANCE SECURITY AND TO GRANT EASY ACCESSIBILITY. SECURITY CAN BE PURSUED BY MEANS OF SEVERAL STRATEGIES ORIENTED TO SECRETE THE VOTE, TO CHECK THE VOTER IDENTITY, TO DECOUPLE THE VOTER FROM HIS CHOICE AND TO ALLOW THE BALLOT TO BE AUDITED. ON THE OTHER HAND, ACCESSIBILITY TOO CAN BE GREATLY IMPROVED BY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE REMOTELY OR BY USING VOTING MACHINES, LOCATED AT POLLING STATIONS, EQUIPPED WITH APPROPRIATE INTERFACES FOR DISABLED PEOPLE. IN THIS PAPER A DIGITAL TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION (DTT) BASED VOTING SYSTEM IS PRESENTED. THIS KIND OF ELECTRONIC VOTING TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS DISABLED USERS (ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY PROBLEMS), BUT NOT ONLY, TO CAST THEIR VOTE FROM HOME AND, ABOVE ALL, BY USING COMMON WELL-KNOWN DEVICES. IN FACT, THE NEEDED BASIC EQUIPMENT ARE A TV SET, A SET TOP BOX (STB) WITH ITS REMOTE CONTROL AND A TELEPHONE LINE. THE COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE CONSISTS OF AN MHP (MULTIMEDIA HOME PLATFORM) APPLICATION THAT ACTS AS A CLIENT APPLICATION; A SERVER APPLICATION THAT ACTS AS A NETWORK/COUNTING SERVER FOR E-VOTING; AND A SECURITY PROTOCOL BASED ON ASYMMETRIC KEY ENCRYPTION TO ENSURE AUTHENTICATION AND SECRECY OF THE VOTE. THE MHP APPLICATION IS BROADCASTED BY A CERTIFIED (E.G. NATIONAL) TV CHANNEL THAT GRANTS ITS ORIGINALITY. THE USER NEEDS A SMART CARD ISSUED BY A NATIONAL AUTHORITY (0,G. THE ELECTRONIC IDENTITY CARD) TO AUTHENTICATE HIMSELF TO THE APPLICATION AND TO SIGN THE ENCRYPTED BALLOT TO SEND TO THE SERVER APPLICATION. THE VOTER CAN SIMPLY BROWSE THE APPLICATION, DISPLAYED ON HIS TV SCREEN, BY ACTING ON THE STB REMOTE CONTROL. THE SERVER APPLICATION IS IN CHARGE TO VERIFY USER IDENTITY, TO GATHER AND STORE USER'S ENCRYPTED BALLOTS AND FINALLY TO COUNT VOTES. THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CLIENT APPLICATION AND THE SERVER TAKES PLACE BY MEANS OF A SECURED CHANNEL (USING HTTPS), ESTABLISHED OVER THE COMMON TELEPHONE LINE, WHILE THE VOTING OPERATIONS ARE SECURED WITH THE HELP OF ASYMMETRIC KEYS ENCRYPTION. THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN PROVEN IN LABORATORY TESTS AND ALSO IN A PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION FOR USA PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ON 2008 NOVEMBER 4(TH).","UNIV FLORENCE, MICC, FLORENCE, ITALY.","CALDELLI, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV FLORENCE, MICC, FLORENCE, ITALY.","CHAUM D, 2004, DOI 10.1109/msecp.2004.1264852; CHAUM D, 2008; CHAUM D, 2008, DOI 10.1109/msp.2008.70; ESSEX, 2007; FISHER, 2005; GARERA S, 2007; JEFFERSON D, 2004; KOHNO T, 2004; MAGI T, 2007",0,2009,COMPUTER SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000282064100002,ISI,UNIV FLORENCE,UNIV FLORENCE,NA,"CALDELLI R, 2009, NA","CALDELLI R, 2009, NA",ITALY,978-3-642-04279-9,978-3-642-04279-9,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; TELECOMMUNICATIONS",0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,NA,WOS

CURRENT EUROPEAN INITIATIVES FOCUS ON PROVIDING ACCESS TO A PC WITH INTERNET AND ENSURING BASIC USAGE SKILLS TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, WHILE MEDIA COMPETENCE IS OF LESS IMPORTANCE.

COUNTRIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS LOW- OR HIGH-INCOME AND IT IS SHOWN THAT THE DIFFUSION PROCESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY A DIFFERENT S-SHAPED CURVE IN EACH GROUP. THE ESTIMATED DIFFUSION CURVES PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF VERY SLOW ""CATCHING UP"".

IN ORDER TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, TWO STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED: ONE AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND ONE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. BASED ON DATA COLLECTED FROM 330 LEBANESE POTENTIAL USERS OF PUBLIC E-SERVICES, THE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL STUDY MEASURES THE IMPACTS OF INCOME, EDUCATION LEVEL, AND OCCUPATION DISPARITIES ON THE E-ACCESS AND E-SKILLS DIVIDES. IT ALSO MEASURES THE IMPACTS OF GENDER, RELIGIOUS, REGIONAL, AND GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE SECOND STUDY COMPARES 86 COUNTRIES BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS: ECONOMIC (MEASURED BY GDP PER CAPITA), SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC (HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX), CULTURAL (DISPARITIES BETWEEN GENDERS), AND POLITICAL (DEMOCRACY INDEX). IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WE ALSO COMPARE THESE RESULTS TO THOSE OF THE ARAB WORLD (21 COUNTRIES). BY COMPARING THE MICRO WITH THE MACRO LEVEL OF ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL POINT OF VIEW THAT CAN MEASURE THE INDIVIDUAL IMPACTS ON THE MACRO AND THE MACRO IMPACTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL.","UNIV PARIS 09, F-75775 PARIS 16, FRANCE.",NA,"ABUKHALIL A, 1998; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BASU S, 2004, DOI 10.1080/13600860410001674779; BEILOCK R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3; BELANGER F, 2006; BELANGER F, 2005; BEN BOUBAKER K, 2005; BENBASAT I, 2003; BERGKVIST L, 2007, DOI 10.1509/jmkr.44.2.175; BODIE G, 2008; BOLLEN K, 1991, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.110.2.305; BOUDREAU M, 2001, DOI 10.2307/3250956; BUENTE W, 2008, DOI 10.1002/asi.20883; CASTELLS M, 2007; CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY F, 2008; CHEN W, 2003; CIBORRA C, 2005, DOI 10.1108/09593840510615879; CILAN C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.11.002; CORNWELL T, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0276146704269301; CORRALES J, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2478.2006.00431.x; CULLEN R, 2001, DOI 10.1108/14684520110410517; DADA D, 2006; DASGUPTA S, 2001; DAVIS J, 1997; DIAMANTOPOULOS A, 2001, DOI 10.1509/jmkr.38.2.269.18845; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DWIVEDI Y, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.09.001; EBO B, 1998; EL LOUADI M, 2008; ELKHOURY M, 2001; FOULGER D, 2001; GEFEN D, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0305-0483(00)00021-9; GOLDMAN CHARLES A, 2008; GRUNDEN K, 2009; HARGITTAI E, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6; HART-TEETER, 2003; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; HOFFMAN D, 2000; HOFSTEDE G, 1980; HOFSTEDE G, 1983; HOFSTEDE G, 2001; HOFSTEDE G, 2000; HOWARD P, 2001; HOWARD P, 2009, DOI 10.1080/01972240902848948; JAMES J, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s11205-007-9156-9; JARVIS C, 2003, DOI 10.1086/376806; JUNG J, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004006; KANOVSKY E, 1997; KARAKE SHALHOUB Z, 2004; KIISKI S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3; KNUDSEN A, 2005; KRAEMAR K, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00071; LAITHY H, 2008; LOCH K, 2003, DOI 10.1109/tem.2002.808257; LOSH S, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0894439303262557; MALIK H, 1997; MANN C L, 2001; MARTIN S, 2004; MCSWEENEY B, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0018726702551004; MILNER H, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0010414005282983; NAGEL C R, 2002; NOCE A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.04.006; NORRIS P, 2001; NTIA, 1995; NTIA, 2000; NUNNALLY J, 1994; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2001, DOI 10.1287/isre.12.2.121.9700; RIGGINS F, 2005; ROBBIN A, 2008, DOI 10.1002/asi.20925; ROBISON K K, 2001; ROGERS EVERETT M, 1983; ROSSITER J, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-8116(02)00097-6; SCHILLER H, 1996; SHELLEY M, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0894439303262580; SINGH A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.01.001; SINGH V, 2004; SRITE M, 2006; STRAUB D, 1994, DOI 10.1287/isre.5.1.23; STUMP R, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0276146708325386; TAPSCOTT D, 1998; THOMAS J, 2003, DOI 10.1093/jpart/mug010; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; UNDESA, 2008; UNDP, 2008; UNPAN, 2005; VAN BIRGELEN M, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-8116(02)00047-2; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.09.006; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; VICTORY N, 2002; WALLBANK T, 1987; WEBER L, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0894439302238969",0,2010,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000330684100104,ISI,NA,NOTREPORTED,NA,"HARFOUCHE A, 2010, NA","HARFOUCHE A, 2010, NA",FRANCE,978-0-9821489-3-8,978-0-9821489-3-8,MANAGEMENT,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NA,WOS

UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYMENT TRAINING IN A BROAD SENSE, THE FORMS OF LEARNING ARE EXAMINED AS FORMS OF SOCIALIZATION IN CYBERSPACE, GENERALLY LINKED TO INSTRUMENTAL USES. CONSIDERING THIS, THE DISCOURSES GENERATED FROM DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION ARE PRESENTED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE RICHER TRAINING FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THE METHODOLOGY USED IS QUALITATIVE AND CONSISTS OF 11 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE APPROACHING THE PHASE OF LIFE RUNNING FROM STABILITY AT WORK TO RETIREMENT. THEIR POSITIONS IN THE JOB MARKET AND THEIR ORGANIZATION CORRESPOND TO A HETEROGENEOUS SAMPLE IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION SECTORS AND DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE EMPLOYMENT SCALE. IN THIS WAY, THE DIFFERENT PROCESSES FOR INTEGRATING ICTS INTO THE WORK OF OVER-44S ARE CAPTURED WHILE WE FIND OUT THE EFFECT OF COMPUTERIZATION PROCESSES ON THEIR TASKS AND ON THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THEIR JOBS. IN THE SAME WAY, THE POWER RELATIONSHIPS GENERATED BY A LEARNING PROCESS ARE EXPLORED, TOGETHER WITH THE STRATEGIC SEARCH FOR FORMS OF LEARNING THAT DO NOT QUESTION A PERSON'S POSITION IN THE STRUCTURE OR CONSIDER THE END OF THEIR PRODUCTIVE LIFE AS A BARRIER TO LEARNING. MEANWHILE, THE POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES OF ORGANIZATIONS IN TERMS OF INTEGRATING OLDER PEOPLE INTO ICTS ARE EXAMINED, ALONG WITH THE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSES AND STRATEGIES OF THE OLDER PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE THEIR POSITION IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS BEING UNDER THREAT. FINALLY, WE CONCLUDE WITH SOME STRATEGIC LINES THAT COULD CORRECT DEFICIENCIES IN THE GENERAL ADAPTATION TO CYBERSPACE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN THIS FINAL PHASE OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL SPHERE.","JAUME I UNIV, DEPT PHILOSOPHY & SOCIOL, CASTELLON DE LA PLANA, SPAIN.",NA,"ANEESH A, 2001; BECK U, 2003; BRAVERMAN H, 1984; CASTELLS M, 1998; CORIAT B, 1985; EUROPEAN C, 1995; FROBEL F, 1980; GOFFMAN E, 1990; GOFFMAN E, 2006; HASSAN R, 2008; KOVACS I, 1998",0,2010,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000318781703136,ISI,JAUME I UNIV,NOTREPORTED,NA,"VICENTE VAQ, 2010, NA","VICENTE VAQ, 2010, NA",SPAIN,978-84-613-9386-2,978-84-613-9386-2,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,NA,WOS

DEV.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; ICT INTEGRATION; LANGUAGE OF TEACHING AND LEARNING; TEACHER TRAINING; DISADVANTAGED LEARNERS,TECHNOLOGY; ACCESS,"THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) INTEGRATION IN A SOUTH AFRICAN CLASSROOM SETTING. THE MAIN FOCUS IS ON THE CONCEPT OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE, AND HOW CULTURAL COMPLEXITY WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON LANGUAGE CAN AFFECT THE DIVIDE IN SCHOOLS THAT ALREADY HAVE MATERIAL ACCESS TO ICT. THE STUDY IS BASED ON FIELDWORK IN SEVENTH-GRADE CLASSES IN FOUR PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA. THE LEARNERS ANSWERED A QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING THEIR ICT USE AND SKILLS, AND INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH LEARNERS, TEACHERS, AND PRINCIPALS. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS ARGUED THAT THE CHALLENGES OF LANGUAGE IN SOUTH AFRICAN SCHOOLS CAN EXACERBATE OR MAINTAIN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG LEARNERS WHO ARE ALREADY DISADVANTAGED DUE TO A RANGE OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. FOR LEARNERS TO FULLY MASTER THE USE OF ICT IN TODAY'S GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY, IT NEEDS TO BE PUT IN A LOCAL CONTEXT, WHICH INCLUDES USE IN A FAMILIAR LANGUAGE. MOREOVER, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHER TRAINING ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ENHANCE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND APPROPRIATE ICT INTEGRATION BASED ON LOCAL NEEDS AND CAPACITY.","UNIV OSLO, INST EDUC RES, N-0317 OSLO, NORWAY.","GUDMUNDSDOTTIR, GB (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OSLO, INST EDUC RES, SEM SAELANDS VEI 7,POB 1092 BLINDERN, N-0317 OSLO, NORWAY.","ALEXANDER N, 2003; BAMGBOSE A, 2009; BAUMAN Z, 2001; BIALYSTOK E, 2001; BROCK-UTNE B, 2005; BROCK-UTNE B, 2005; BROCK-UTNE B, 2006; BROWN W, 2008; CAPE G, 2006; COLLE R, 2003; COMPAINE B, 2001; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2005; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2006; DEPARTMENT OF E, 2004; DEPARTMENT OF E, 2004; DESAI Z, 2000; ERIKSEN T, 2007, DOI 10.1080/01419870701599481; ETTA F, 2005; FOUCAULT M, 1980; FOUCAULT M, 1972; GUDMUNDSDOTTIR G, 2009; GUTTERMAN B, 2009; GYEKYE K, 1997; HANNERZ U, 1992; HERMAN H, 2009; HEUGH K, 2000; HOLMARSDOTTIR H, 2005; JAKOBSDOTTIR S, 2008; JANSSENS-BEVERNAGE A, 2005; JOKWENI M, 2004; KATZ J, 2002; KENISTON K, 2004; KHANYA, 2009; KHANYA, 2009; KUBOW P, 2009; MADON S, 2009, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20108; MAIR L, 1984; MAZRUI A, 1985; MESTHRIE R, 2009; NOMLOMO V, 2006; NORRIS P, 2001; PLOMP T, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-8928-2; PRAH K K, 2009; QORRO M, 2008; QURESHI S, 2009, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20132; RAMSAY-BRIJBALL M, 2002; SAMOFF J, 2001, DOI 10.1111/1467-7660.00220; SEMALI L, 2009; SEN A, 1999; SEN A, 1999; SEN A, 1992; SKUTNABB-KANGAS T, 2000; SOLTANE K, 2004; SOUTH AFRICAN G, 1996; TOURE K, 2008; UNWIN T, 2009; VAN BINSBERGEN W, 2004; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN GRASDORFF E, 2004; WARSCHAUER M, 2010, DOI 10.3102/0091732x09349791; WASSERMAN H, 2002; WCED, 2002; WCED, 2009; ZHENG Y, 2009, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20115",12,2010,DEVELOPMENT STUDIES; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000208173800003,ISI,UNIV OSLO,UNIV OSLO,NA,"GUDMUNDSDOTTIR GB, 2010, INFORM TECHNOL DEV","GUDMUNDSDOTTIR GB, 2010, INFORM TECHNOL DEV",NORWAY,10.1080/02681102.2010.498409,NA,DEVELOPMENT STUDIES; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

TECHNOL.,ARTICLE,BUSINESS ETHICS; STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT; CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP; CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY; ICT; DIGITAL DIVIDES; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; DIGITAL SUSTAINABILITY,NA,"THIS CONCEPTUAL ARTICLE DISCUSSES STRATEGIES OF CORPORATIONS IN THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICT) SECTOR AND THEIR ROLE IN THE CONFLICT OVER ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT. ITS MAIN HYPOTHESIS IS THAT ICT CORPORATIONS ARE VERY CAPABLE ACTORS WHEN IT COMES TO BRIDGING DIGITAL DIVIDES IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES-MAYBE EVEN THE MOST CAPABLE ACTORS. THEREFORE, IT IS ARGUED THAT ICT CORPORATIONS COULD USE THEIR CAPABILITIES TO HELP CITIZENS GAIN SUSTAINABLE ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER TO ENABLE THEM TO LEAD SELF-SUFFICIENT LIVES. IN A NUTSHELL, CAPABILITIES ARE PRESENTED AS BOTH THE INPUT (CAPABILITIES OF ICT CORPORATIONS) AS WELL AS THE OUTPUT (CAPABILITY BUILDING FOR EMPOWERING CITIZENS) OF CORPORATE STRATEGY-MAKING FOCUSING ON FAIR ICT. CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP IS PUT FORTH AS THE THEORETICAL CONCEPT BRIDGING CORPORATE STRATEGIES AND ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE: IF ICT CORPORATIONS ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR SELF-UNDERSTANDING OF BEING 'GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENS', THEY COULD BE CRUCIAL PARTNERS IN LESSENING DIGITAL DIVIDES AND HELPING CITIZENS GAIN ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF 'INTEGRATIVE ECONOMIC ETHICS' (ULRICH 2008), IT IS ARGUED THAT ICT CORPORATIONS HAVE GOOD REASON TO ACTIVELY EMPOWER CITIZENS IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BY PURSUING 'INCLUSIVE' STRATEGIES IN MANY FIELDS, SUCH AS OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. THAT WAY, ICT CORPORATIONS COULD ENABLE, SUPPORT AND PROVIDE CITIZENS WITH CAPABILITIES ENABLING THEM TO HELP THEMSELVES. IN ORDER TO MAKE INCLUSIVE BUSINESS MODELS WORK, THE RULES AND REGULATIONS COMPANIES FIND THEMSELVES IN TODAY MUST ENABLE THEM TO ACT RESPONSIBLY WITHOUT GETTING PENALIZED BY MORE RUTHLESS COMPETITORS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES SEVERAL CASES FROM THE ICT FIELD TO ILLUSTRATE THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS MODEL AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE INDUSTRY.

SUBTLE DIFFERENCES AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE EMERGED; THESE DIFFERENCES DETERMINE THAT THE RESOURCES THE NETWORK OFFERS HAVE BEEN USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS, THUS CREATING GAPS IN THE UNIVERSITY POPULATION. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF INCIDENCE OF THE VARIABLE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' INCOMES ON THE USES AND INTENSITY OF USE OF THE INTERNET TOOLS AND RESOURCES. STUDENTS WERE CLASSIFIED USING FACTOR ANALYSIS COMPLEMENTED THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN USER PROFILES; THESE PROFILES WERE VERIFIED BY MEANS OF DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS. FINALLY, CHI-SQUARE WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME LEVEL AND USER PROFILES. AS A RESULT, THREE PROFILES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF USE AND INTENSITY OF USE OF THE INTERNET TOOLS AND RESOURCES, AND STATISTICALLY THE INCIDENCE OF INCOME IN THE CREATION OF THOSE PROFILES WAS PROVED. TO CONCLUDE, WE CAN SAY THAT THE INCOME LEVEL FALLS MAINLY ON THE VARIABLES THAT DEFINE THE ACCESS POSSIBILITIES; GENDER HAS A SPECIAL BEHAVIOR; HOWEVER, SINCE THE PROFILE OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL HAS A DOUBLE PROPORTION FOR MEN, THOUGH WOMEN HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL TERMS.","UNIV TECN PARTICULAR LOJA, UNIT RES DISTANCE TEACHING, LOJA, ECUADOR.;  UNIV HUELVA, HUELVA, SPAIN.","TORRES, JC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TECN PARTICULAR LOJA, UNIT RES DISTANCE TEACHING, LOJA, ECUADOR.","CASTANO-MUNOZ J, 2010, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v7i1.661; CASTELLS M, 2001; HERREROS M, 2009, DOI 10.3916/c33-2009-01-001; CHEN R, 2007, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.9974; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; GRAHAM R, 2010; ISKE S, 2005; KEIL M, 2008; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WARSCHAUER M, 2004, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001; WILSON III E J, 2006",10,2011,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000295037500010,ISI,UNIV TECN PARTICULAR LOJA;UNIV HUELVA,UNIV TECN PARTICULAR LOJA,NA,"TORRES JC, 2011, COMUNICAR","TORRES JC, 2011, COMUNICAR",ECUADOR;SPAIN,10.3916/c37-2011-02-08,NA,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,12,GRUPO COMUNICAR,NA,WOS

SELF-EFFICACY IS AN IMPORTANT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY AND DESCRIBE HOW STUDENTS PERCEIVE THEIR OWN ABILITY TO SOLVE A TASK. ICE USER PROFILES WERE DEVELOPED AS AN EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY AND CATEGORIZE STUDENTS BASED ON HOW FREQUENT THEY USE ICT. IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE CHOSEN SIX ICT USER PROFILES IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LEISURE ACTIVITIES AND SCHOOL ACTIVITIES. EACH ICT USER-PROFILE WAS COMPUTED BY COMBINING TWO DIMENSIONS (FREQUENCY OF ICT USE FOR LEISURE PURPOSES AND FREQUENCY OF ICT USE FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES). WE TRIED TO IDENTIFY HOW STUDENTS' PERCEPTION OF THEIR ABILITY TO SOLVE A TASK IS RELATED TO BOTH THEIR GENDER AND HOW FREQUENTLY THEY USE ICT. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT STUDENT'S SELF-EFFICACY VARIED BETWEEN THE ICT USER PROFILES. THE FINDINGS SHOWED HOW AN INCREASED LEVEL OF SELF-EFFICACY IN ICT HIGH-LEVEL TASKS IS RELATED TO BOTH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF LEISURE USE AND WITH AN INCREASED LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL USE.

SUCCESSFUL T-GOVERNMENT IS PREDICATED ON CITIZEN ADOPTION AND USAGE OF E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USAGE OF E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES AMONG MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY ON THE UNFORTUNATE SIDE OF THE DIVIDE. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO MEMBERS, OF A TECHNO-DISADVANTAGED PUBLIC HOUSING COMMUNITY AND NEIGHBORING HOUSEHOLDS, WHO PARTOOK IN TRAINING OR USED THE COMMUNITY COMPUTER LAB. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PERCEIVED ACCESS BARRIERS AND PERCEIVED EASE OF USE (PEOU) ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH USAGE, WHILE PERCEIVED USEFULNESS (PU) IS NOT. AMONG THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME ALL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ACCESS BARRIERS AND EMPLOYMENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PEOU. FINALLY, PEOU IS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PU. OVERALL, THE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THAT T-GOVERNMENT CANNOT CROSS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMS THAT ENHANCE CITIZENS' EASE IN USING SUCH SERVICES.

THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE ARCHITECTURE AND THE MAIN PERFORMANCE RESULTS OF A TWO-WAY BROADBAND SATELLITE-BASED SYSTEM THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S FP6 UNIC PROJECT (UNIVERSAL SATELLITE HOME CONNECTION). THE AIM OF UNIC WAS TWOFOLD: ON ONE SIDE, IT ADDRESSED THE URBAN-RURAL DIGITAL DIVIDE BY EXPLOITING AT BEST THE FEATURES OF EXISTING ADVANCED TWO-WAY SATELLITE TECHNOLOGIES; ON THE OTHER, THE PROJECT ALSO INVESTIGATED HOW TO BRIDGE THE 'SOCIAL DIVIDE' THAT ARISES FROM THE LACK OF COMPUTER OWNERSHIP OR COMPUTER LITERACY OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF END-USERS, BY PROVIDING INTERACTIVE SERVICES ON A STANDARD TV SET THROUGH AN AD-HOC SET-TOP-BOX. THE UNIC SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE IS BASED ON DVB-S2 AND DVB-RCS TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FORWARD AND THE RETURN LINK, RESPECTIVELY, POSSIBLY PAIRED BY A LOCAL TERRESTRIAL WIRELESS NETWORK (E. G. WI-FI) FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONNECTIVITY TO END-USERS. THE UNIC SET-TOP BOX IS FED BY THE SATELLITE GATEWAY VIA A STANDARD IP CONNECTION EITHER THROUGH THE LOCAL TERRESTRIAL NETWORK OR DIRECTLY TO THE SATELLITE NETWORK. MANAGEMENT OF THE SATELLITE BANDWIDTH IS OPTIMIZED BY THE UNIC PLATFORM THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF AN ADAPTIVE RESOURCE ALLOCATION TECHNIQUE BASED ON THE FLEXIBLE FRAMING STRUCTURE OF DVB-S2: THE KEY FACTOR IN THIS RESPECT TURNS OUT TO BE THE FEATURE OF ADAPTIVE CODING AND MODULATION (ACM), TOGETHER WITH A SUITED QUALITY OF SERVICE (QOS) POLICY TO CONTROL THE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT ARE FED INTO THE NETWORK.

JAMES J,SHARING MOBILE PHONES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DIGITAL DIVIDE,TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE,TECHNOL. FORECAST. SOC. CHANG.,ARTICLE,HOUSEHOLD SHARING; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY,NA,"CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN MOBILE PHONES BETWEEN RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES ARE BASED ON THE ETHNOCENTRIC ASSUMPTION THAT IN BOTH REGIONS THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS TAKES PLACE THROUGH INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP. BUT WHILE THIS ASSUMPTION MAY BE LARGELY TRUE IN THE FORMER COUNTRIES, IT DOES NOT MATCH THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE LATTER REGIONS WHERE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SHARING IS SHOWN TO TAKE PLACE (PARTLY FOR CULTURAL REASONS). USING THE AVAILABLE SURVEY EVIDENCE AND A SIMPLE ARITHMETIC FRAMEWORK, I SHOW THAT WHEN SHARING IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, THE DIVIDE ENTIRELY CEASES TO EXIST OR IS GREATLY REDUCED (THOUGH THERE ARE ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS GENERAL PATTERN). IMPROVEMENTS IN DATA COLLECTION PRACTICE WILL TEND, AS I SEE IT, TO STRENGTHEN RATHER THAN CAST DOUBT UPON THIS NOVEL FINDING. IF SO, QUESTIONS ARISE AS TO THE NEED FOR A GAP ANALYSIS PER SE. AS DEFINED BY MOST INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN MOBILE PHONES IS THE RATIO OF SUBSCRIBERS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES TO SUBSCRIBERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (I USE THE TERMS OWNERS AND SUBSCRIBERS SYNONYMOUSLY(1)). THIS DEFINITION HOWEVER ASSUMES THAT THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH BENEFITS ACCRUE TO INDIVIDUALS IS BY INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP OF MOBILE PHONES.(2) AND WHILE THIS MAY MAKE SENSE IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHERE OWNERSHIP IS INDEED WIDESPREAD, IT DOES NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE IN POOR COUNTRIES WHERE BENEFITS FROM USE ARE MORE HEAVILY DERIVED BY SHARING OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THE PROBLEM HERE IS CREATED BY THE ILLEGITIMATE TRANSPOSITION OF AN ASSUMPTION FROM ONE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO A HIGHLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT, A PHENOMENON DESCRIBED, AMONG OTHERS, BY MYRDAL [5]. MY PURPOSE BELOW IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ASSUMPTION FOR THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN MOBILE PHONES BETWEEN RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES. IN PARTICULAR, I WILL ARGUE THAT CURRENT MEASURES OF THIS DIVIDE ARE QUITE HEAVILY OVERSTATED, IN SOME CASES TO THE POINT WHERE THE DIVIDE DISAPPEARS ALTOGETHER. FOR THIS PURPOSE I WILL RELY MAINLY ON HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA THAT PERTAINS TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PAST DECADE. THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER DEALS WITH THE CONTEXT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAJOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF MOBILE PHONES. THE SECOND PART IS CONCERNED WITH THE CONCEPTS AND MEASURES OF SHARING WHILE THE FINAL PART IS CONCERNED WITH EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. BOTH PARTS 2 AND 3 ARE BASED ON A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO MAJOR TYPES OF SHARING BEHAVIOR. AND BOTH PARTS USE A MEASURE OF MOBILE PHONES PER 100 INHABITANTS. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER INC.

THE ANALYSIS LEADS TO IDENTIFY DUTCH REGIONS AS THE TOP-10 IN ICT, WHILE GREECE AND BULGARIA OCCUPY THE BOTTOM-10. THEREFORE, RESULTS SHOW THAT THE REGIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE REFLECTS TO SOME EXTENT THE INCOME GAP. HOWEVER, REGIONAL POLICY SEEMS TO BE HAVING SOME POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION. IN PARTICULAR, THE RURAL-VERSUS-URBAN DIMENSION OF THE DIGITAL GAP APPEARS TO BE LESS IMPORTANT THAN IT IS USUALLY CLAIMED TO.

POLICY,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; INTERNET ADOPTION; GROSS BENEFITS; ADOPTION COSTS,DIFFUSION,"IN THIS PAPER, WE PROPOSE AN EMPIRICAL MODEL OF INTERNET ADOPTION WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE HOUSEHOLD'S DESIRE TO ADOPT THE INTERNET. OUR RESEARCH SUPPORTS THREE CENTRAL FINDINGS. FIRST, WE DETERMINE THE MAIN FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN THE CROSS-SECTIONAL VARIANCE IN GROSS BENEFITS. SECOND, WE ESTIMATE THE PREDICTED PROBABILITIES THAT A HOUSEHOLD DOES NOT DESIRE TO ADOPT THE INTERNET AND THAT A HOUSEHOLD DESIRES TO ADOPT THE INTERNET BUT DOES NOT BECAUSE ITS ADOPTION COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN ITS GROSS BENEFITS. WE SHOW THAT WHILE THE CROSS-SECTIONAL VARIANCE IN THE FIRST PREDICTED PROBABILITY IS HIGH, THE CROSS-SECTIONAL VARIANCE IN THE SECOND ONE IS LOW (EXCEPT FOR THE AGE FACTOR). THIRD, WE COMPUTE THE PREDICTED ADOPTION PROBABILITY ASSUMING THAT THE ADOPTION COSTS ARE HOMOGENEOUS ACROSS HOUSEHOLDS. WE SHOW THAT, FOR A GIVEN DIMENSION (EXCEPT FOR THE AGE FACTOR), THE ADOPTION RATE WILL BE ONLY SLIGHTLY MODIFIED IF THE ADOPTION COSTS ARE HOMOGENEOUS ACROSS HOUSEHOLDS. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS MAINLY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN GROSS BENEFITS OF ADOPTION. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER B.V.

STUD.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; USERS; USER TYPES; INTERNET; PARTICIPATION,MEDIA; ACCEPTANCE; PATTERNS; SKILLS; GENDER; USAGE,"THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY IDENTIFYING THE VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE IN EUROPE USE THE INTERNET. FIRST, BY USING CLUSTER ANALYSIS ON SURVEY DATA (N = 12,666/AGE: 16-74 YEARS) FROM EUROSTAT ON INTERNET USAGE IN NORWAY, SWEDEN, AUSTRIA, THE UK, AND SPAIN, WE IDENTIFIED FIVE USER TYPES: NON-USERS (42%), SPORADIC USERS (18%), INSTRUMENTAL USERS (18%), ENTERTAINMENT USERS (10%), AND ADVANCED USERS (12%). THESE USER TYPES DIFFER IN THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS OVER COUNTRY, AGE, ACCESS, HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS, AND GENDER. AN ALARMING FINDING IS THAT 60% OF THE POPULATION WAS FOUND TO BE EITHER NON-USERS OR SPORADIC USERS, WHICH REFLECTS A LARGE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN EUROPE. SECOND, WE CONDUCTED A LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY THE PREDICTORS FOR DIFFERENT USER TYPES. WE FOUND ON A CROSS-NATIONAL LEVEL THAT AGE AND INTERNET ACCESS ARE THE MOST SALIENT PREDICTORS, WHEREAS GENDER AND HOUSEHOLD SEEMS TO BE LESS RELEVANT. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF VARIANCE EXPLAINED DIFFERS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. WE ALSO SUGGESTED A FUTURE INCREASE IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THE IDENTIFIED USER TYPES-A USER TYPE DIVIDE. THE USER TYPOLOGY AND THE IDENTIFIED PREDICTORS MIGHT HELP RESEARCHERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND DECISION MAKERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND INTERNET USERS AND THE MULTI-COMPLEX VARIATIONS AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND COUNTRIES. THIS KNOWLEDGE WILL ALSO SERVE AS A MEANS TO UNDERSTAND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY PROVIDING A MORE NUANCED PERSPECTIVE ON EUROPEANS' UNEQUAL USAGE OF THE INTERNET AND PARTICIPATION IN AN INCREASINGLY DIGITAL SOCIETY.

MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE ARTICLE EXAMINES WHETHER VARYING PATTERNS OF COMPUTER ACCESS, ATTITUDES, COMPETENCIES AND USES CAN BE SEEN AS CONSTITUTING DIFFERENCES IN CULTURAL CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, GENDER WAS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY AS AN IMPORTANT BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTIC IN DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO MODEL THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INFLUENCING FACTORS UPON THE ICT-RELATED VARIABLES. WHAT EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSES WAS THAT SES AFFECTS THE COMPUTER-USE PROFILE ONLY MODERATELY. NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SES AND COMPUTER OWNERSHIP WAS FOUND. MOREOVER, THE ACQUISITION OF ICT COMPETENCIES CAN NO LONGER BE ATTRIBUTED TO COMPUTER OWNERSHIP. APART FROM A SMALL EFFECT ON ICT USE (A HIGHER SES TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ICT USE), SES DOES NOT SEEM TO AFFECT THE COMPUTER-USE PROFILE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN FLANDERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE EXISTING DIFFERENCES IN SES ON COMPUTER-USE PROFILE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY MARKED TO DEDUCE THAT ICT CAN BE SEEN AS AN INDICATOR OF DIFFERING CULTURAL CAPITAL.","UNIV GHENT, DEPT EDUC STUDIES, RES FDN FLANDERS, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM.;  UNIV GHENT, DEPT SOCIOL, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM.","TONDEUR, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GHENT, DEPT EDUC STUDIES, RES FDN FLANDERS, HENRI DUNANTLAAN 2, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM.","ARBUCKLE J, 2003; BAGOZZI R, 1992, DOI 10.1177/001872679204500702; BOLLEN K, 1993; BOURDIEU P, 2001; BOURDIEU P, 1966, DOI 10.2307/3319132; BOURDIEU P, 1977; BROOS A, 2006; CASTELLS M, 2009; CHO J, 2003; CLARK L, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480300500106; COLEMAN JAMES S, 1966; DE GRAAF N, 2000; DEGRAAF P, 1986; DIMAGGIO P, 1982, DOI 10.2307/2094962; DUQUET N, 2006; ELCHARDUS M, 2002; ERIKSON R, 1979, DOI 10.2307/589632; FACER K, 2001; FETSCHERIN M, 2008; FLEM G, 2007; FOREHAND R, 1987, DOI 10.1016/0193-3973(87)90006-2; GARNIER M, 1976; GIFI A, 1981; GLORIEUX I, 2006; GORSKI P, 2005; HACKER K L, 2003, DOI 10.1023/a:1024968602974; HAKKARAINEN K, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(00)00007-5; HERMANS R, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2008.02.001; HORRIGAN J, 2002; HU L, 1999, DOI 10.1080/10705519909540118; INT WORLD S, 2009; JANSSEN J, 1994; KATSILLIS J, 1990, DOI 10.2307/2095632; KATZ Y, 2002, DOI 10.1046/j.0266-4909.2001.00202.x; KEARNS P, 2002; KENNEDY T, 2003; KERCKHOFF A, 1975, DOI 10.1086/225998; KOIVUSILTA L, 2007, DOI 10.1080/14034940600868721; KOZMA R, 2003; KULIK J, 1999; LAREAU A, 2003, DOI 10.1023/b:ryso.0000004951.04408.b0; LAZARUS W, 2000; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LOEHLIN J, 1998; LOOKER E, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0894439303256536; LOVELESS A, 2002; LUCAS S, 2001, DOI 10.1086/321300; NORRIS P, 2001; ODWYER L, 2004; OECD C, 2001; PELLERIAUX K, 2001; PLOMP T, 2003; REINEN I, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(97)00005-5; RESTA P, 1992, DOI 10.1016/0167-9287(92)80021-3; RESTA P, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-73315-9_44; ROSCIGNO V, 1999, DOI 10.2307/2673227; SCHACTER J, 2001; SELHOFER H, 2002; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SHAPKA J, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00059-6; SULLIVAN A, 2001, DOI 10.1177/0038038501035004006; SUTTON R, 1991, DOI 10.3102/00346543061004475; TAN B, 1998; TONDEUR J, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00205.x; TONDEUR J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.003; TONDEUR J, 2009, DOI 10.1080/03055690902804349; VAN BRAAK J, 2005; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VANDENBROUCKE F, 2007; VANDERLINDE R, 2008; VRYONIDES M, 2007, DOI 10.1080/01411920701657009; WARSHAUER M, 2002; WILLIS P, 1981; WILSON K, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0894439303021002001",87,2011,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000287517600010,ISI,UNIV GHENT;UNIV GHENT,UNIV GHENT,NA,"TONDEUR J, 2011, NEW MEDIA SOC","TONDEUR J, 2011, NEW MEDIA SOC",BELGIUM;BELGIUM,10.1177/1461444810369245,NA,COMMUNICATION,91,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,NA,WOS

WITH A HISTORY SPAN OF ALMOST TWO DECADES, EGOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTATIONS HAVE OFTEN REACHED DEAD ENDS AND HAVE REGULARLY FAILED TO DELIVER THE PROMISE THAT THE GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE INITIATED THEM HAVE MADE TO THEIR CITIZENS. DESPITE AN ABUNDANCE OF DEVELOPMENT MODELS AND BEST CASE SCENARIOS IDENTIFIED IN LITERATURE, EGOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE CONTINUALLY FAILING TO ATTRACT THE CITIZENS AND TO CAPTURE THEIR TRUST AND FAITH. THE MAIN REASON QUOTED FOR SUCH FAILURES IS THE LACK OF INNOVATION AND INCLUSIVITY IN THE WAY A SERVICE IS DESIGNED AND DELIVERED. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS THE MAJOR RISK OF MARGINALIZING SECTORS OF SOCIETY OR EVEN WHOLE CONTINENTS DUE TO LACK OF ACCESS TO WEB BASED SERVICES. IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD IT IS MAINLY THE LACK OF, OR POOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAINTAINS AND OFTEN WIDENS THE DIVIDE, WHILE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD IT IS LACK OF SKILLS AND DIFFICULTY OF ACCESSING SERVICES THAT LEADS CITIZENS TO ABANDON THEIR EFFORTS IN USING SERVICES ONLINE. WHATEVER THE REASON THAT LEADS TO NON-ACCESS OF SERVICES THE EFFECT IS SIMILAR AND THOSE CITIZENS THAT FALL VICTIM TO IT ARE INCREASINGLY CONSUMED INTO THE TRAP OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE DIVIDE HAVE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE WEB. HOWEVER, THE QUALITY AND ACCESSIBILITY OF ONLINE SERVICES IS QUITE OFTEN THEN REASON WHY CITIZENS DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM WEB-BASED SERVICES AND THE INTERNET IN TOTAL. THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO EXPLORE THE SHORTFALL IN CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING A GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS IN PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING AND DELIVERING SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT, BUT EQUALLY CATER FOR THE NEEDS OF THE CITIZENS AS END USERS OF THE SERVICE.","UNIV EAST LONDON, LONDON E15 4LZ, ENGLAND.;  DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE, KOMOTINI, GREECE.;  UNIV MACEDONIA, THESSALONIKI, GREECE.","PIMENIDIS, E (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV EAST LONDON, LONDON E15 4LZ, ENGLAND.","BOLISSIAN J, 2006; BUYS P, 2008; DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND A, 2006; EBBERS W, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.11.003; GOLDFARB A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001; HM G, 2005; JAMES J, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0165551505050788; JANSSEN M, 2003; KELLY S, 2011; KOLSAKER A, 2009; MILLIARD J, 2010; PIMENIDIS E, 2009, DOI 10.1504/ijesdf.2009.027673; SAVVAS I, 2009; SHAREEF S, 2010; SIPIOR J, 2005",2,2011,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000307994600048,ISI,UNIV EAST LONDON;DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE;UNIV MACEDONIA,UNIV EAST LONDON,NA,"PIMENIDIS E, 2011, NA","PIMENIDIS E, 2011, NA",UNITED KINGDOM;GREECE;GREECE,978-1-908272-12-6,978-1-908272-12-6,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE",2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NA,WOS

WHILE SOME SOCIETIES OR PARTS OF THEM FULLY EMBARKED FOR THIS ADVENTURE, OTHERS PREFERRED A LIMITED USE OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE TERM ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" HAS BEEN COINED TO DESCRIBE THE NEWLY APPEARED GAP IN ACCESS TO OR USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) DEVICES. AS EUROPEAN COMMISSION ESTABLISHED IN 2010 A DIGITAL AGENDA AND ANNOUNCED A SIGNIFICANT SPENDING ON STRATEGIC ICT RESEARCH, A QUESTION ARISES: IS IT APPROPRIATE TO DEVELOP A UNIQUE STRATEGY FOR ALL EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES OR RATHER A SET OF STRATEGIES TO BE DIFFERENTLY APPLIED FOR EACH SOCIETY OR SEGMENT OF IT? USING A COMPARATIVE METHOD, OUR RESEARCH DESCRIBES THE DIGITAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 27 EUROPEAN MEMBERS BASED ON 2009 YEAR DATA. THE STARTING POINT IS REPRESENTED BY THE OBSERVATION THAT IN THE LEAST ELECTRONICALLY DEVELOPED EUROPEAN STATES ONLY A PART OF THOSE HAVING INTERNET ACCESS IS ALSO USING EGOVERNMENT. THIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE MERE PRESENCE OF ICT DEVICES IS NOT ENOUGH TO TRIGGER A ""DIGITAL REVOLUTION"". HENCE, IN A SPECIFIC SOCIAL FRAMEWORK, A MODERATE PRESENCE OF ELECTRONIC GOVERNANCE COULD BE DETERMINED BY OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS: THE LACK OF EDUCATION, MISTRUST OR ABSENCE OF A REAL NEED. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRESENT PAPER IS MAPPING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION AS A RAPPORT BETWEEN ICT DEVICES, THEIR USE, AND THE RELEVANT CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH SOCIETY. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE SOCIETIES UNDER SCRUTINY ARE NOT IN THE SAME NEED OF DIGITAL SERVICES AND CLOSING THE DIGITAL GAP SHOULD NOT BE THE FINAL GOAL. INSTEAD, THE RESOURCES COULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS MEETING THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF ONE SOCIETY.

COMMUNICATION GAPS ARE MODELLED IN A PROPOSED DIGITAL COMMUNICATION MATRIX WHICH OUGHT TO BE USED FOR EDUCATION AMONGST DIGITALLY UNDERDEVELOPED DESTINATIONS TO SUPPORT THEM IN OVERCOMING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.","IMC FH KREMS UNIV APPL SCI, DEPT TOURISM & LEISURE MANAGEMENT, KREMS, AUSTRIA.",NA,"AGENCIA P, 2004; BAASANJAV U, 2002; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BUHALIS D, 2003; CAWKELL T, 2001, DOI 10.1177/016555150102700107; CHINN M, 2006, DOI 10.1093/oep/gp1024; DEUTSCHER B, 2002; DIMAGGIO P, 2001; FITZGERALD H, 2003; GREIS A, 2004; HARGITTAI E, 2003; JAMES J, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0165551505050788; JAMES J, 2004, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019; MINGHETTI V, 2009; NORRIS P, 2001; OECD, 2009; OECD, 2007; PFEIL S, 2008; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2002; SHELLEY M, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0894439303262580; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; UNITED N, 1948; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; WORTHER M, 2004; YA'U Y Z, 2008",0,2011,COMMUNICATION; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS; BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000289967000022,ISI,IMC FH KREMS UNIV APPL SCI,NOTREPORTED,NA,"MAURER C, 2011, NA","MAURER C, 2011, NA",AUSTRIA,978-3-7091-0502-3,978-3-7091-0502-3,"COMMUNICATION; HOSPITALITY, LEISURE, SPORT & TOURISM; MANAGEMENT",0,SPRINGER-VERLAG WIEN,NA,WOS

THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO OFFER SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THESE MOBILIZATION AND NORMALIZATION THESES. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT MOBILIZATION CLAIMS TEND TO FOCUS ON MANIFESTATIONS ONLINE IN SPECIFIC CASES, WHEREAS NORMALIZATION THESES ARE NORMALLY BUILT ON ASSESSMENTS OF GENERAL INTERNET USE PATTERNS. CONSEQUENTLY, MORE SPECIFIC SURVEYS MUST BE EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE THE NATURE OF POLITICAL INTERNET USE. BASED ON SUCH A SPECIFIC SURVEY (N= 819), THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATE THE USE OF TWO ONLINE VOTE ADVICE APPLICATIONS (VAAS) DURING THE 2006 DUTCH PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS. VAAS ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN DEMOCRACIES WORLDWIDE, ESPECIALLY AMONG A GROUP THAT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED OAPATHETICO ABOUT ELECTORAL POLITICS: YOUTH. WITH STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING, HOWEVER, THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE USE OF THE DUTCH VAAS FITS THE MOBILIZATION THESIS AMONG YOUTH AND THE NORMALIZATION THESIS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE.","UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT COMMUN SCI, AMSTERDAM SCH COMMUN RES, NL-1012 CX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;  UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH, DEPT SOCIAL SCI, LOUGHBOROUGH, LEICS, ENGLAND.;  UNIV AMSTERDAM, MEDIA & COMMUN INST, NL-1012 CX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.","HIRZALLA, F (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT COMMUN SCI, AMSTERDAM SCH COMMUN RES, KLOVENIERSBURGWAL 48, NL-1012 CX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.","AALBERTS C, 2006; ALBRECHT S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0894439307305628; ARENDSEN R, 2003; BARON R, 1986, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOOGERS M, 2006; BYRNE B, 2001; CARPINI M, 2000, DOI 10.1080/10584600050178942; CHADWICK A, 2006; CIVICWEB, 2008; DAHLBERG L, 2007, DOI 10.1057/9780230592469; DAHLBERG L, 2001; DAHLGREN P, 2005, DOI 10.1080/10584600590933160; DANS E, 2009; DI GENNARO C, 2006, DOI 10.1093/pa/gsl004; EVELAND P, 2005; FIVAZ J, 2007; GALSTON W, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.217; GIBSON R, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-856x.2005.00209.x; GRAHAM T, 2009; HABERMAS J, 1962; HIRZALLA F, 2009, DOI 10.1347/tijd.37.3.215; IARD, 2001; JEITZINER B, 2004; JENSEN J L, 2006; KANN M, 2007; KEETER S, 1997; KIES R, 2004; KIES R, 2006; KLEINNIJENHUIS J, 2007; KRUEGER B, 2002, DOI 10.1177/1532673x02030005002; LENHART A, 2003; LIVINGSTONE S, 2005; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0267323107076768; LUPIA A, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2508.2005.00353.x; MIRAMEDIA, 2005; MONTGOMERY K, 2004; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; NORRIS P, 2003; NORRIS P, 2001; OATES S, 2006; POLAT R, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0267323105058251; PREACHER K J, 2008, DOI 10.4135/9781452272054.n2; PREACHER K, 2008; QRIUS, 2005; QUINTELIER E, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13569770701562658; QUINTELIER E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0894439307312631; SANBONMATSU K, 2003, DOI 10.1023/b:pobe.0000004063.83917.2d; SELWYN N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0267323105049631; SHAH D, 2001, DOI 10.1080/105846001750322952; SOBEL M, 1982, DOI 10.2307/ 270723; SOLOP F, 2001; STICHTING M, 2003; STIR, 2009; TOLBERT C, 2002; TOLBERT C, 2003, DOI 10.1177/106591290305600206; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN PRAAG P, 2007; VAN ZOONEN L, 2009; VAN ZOONEN L, 2007, DOI 10.1080/07393180701560849; VEGH S, 2003; VOTECOMPASS, 2009; WALGRAVE S, 2008, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500209",61,2011,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000286901400001,ISI,UNIV AMSTERDAM;UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH;UNIV AMSTERDAM,UNIV AMSTERDAM,NA,"HIRZALLA F, 2011, INF SOC","HIRZALLA F, 2011, INF SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;NETHERLANDS;NETHERLANDS,10.1080/01972243.2011.534360,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,64,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,WOS

THIS PAPER GOES ONE STEP FURTHER BY ATTEMPTING TO DESCRIBE VARIOUS GROUPS OF NON-USERS IN TWO HIGHLY DEVELOPED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES: GREAT BRITAIN AND SWEDEN. RESULTS FROM DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES, MULTIVARIATE REGRESSIONS, AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS WITH TWO WAVES OF COMPARABLE DATA FROM 2007 AND 2009 SHOW A MORE HETEROGENEOUS NON-USER POPULATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND A SLIGHTLY MORE HOMOGENEOUS ONE IN SWEDEN. SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS PLAY A BIGGER ROLE IN INFLUENCING WHO IS GOING ONLINE IN BRITAIN THAN IN SWEDEN. EDUCATION, OCCUPATIONAL STATUS, AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME ARE SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANTS IN BOTH COUNTRIES. THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF INTERNET ADOPTION ARE AGE AND OCCUPATIONAL STATUS. THE ANALYSIS OF A 25-55-YEAR-OLD SUB-SAMPLE SHOWS THAT NON-USERS FROM THIS AGE GROUP FEATURE DIFFERENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS FROM OLDER AGE GROUPS. MIDDLE-AGED BRITISH NON-USERS SHARE TWO SPECIFIC SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS: LOW INCOME AND UNEMPLOYMENT; 25-55-YEAR-OLD SWEDISH NON-USERS TEND TO HAVE LOW INCOMES, BE UNEMPLOYED, AND BE SINGLE. NON-USERS' SELF-ASSESSMENT OF REASONS FOR NON-USE DO NOT SEEM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 'RAW DATA'. NON-USERS MAINLY STATE THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE INTERNET. MANY NON-USERS SHARE SCEPTICAL ATTITUDES ABOUT THE INTERNET, WHICH INFLUENCES INTEREST IN THEM. THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE DETAILED RESEARCH TO KNOW EXACTLY WHICH PEOPLE ARE NOT USING THE INTERNET AND WHY.","UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","REISDORF, BC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, 1 ST GILES, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","ANDERSON B, 2005, DOI 10.1080/13691180500259160; ANDERSON B, 2001; CHEN W, 2004; DUTTON W, 2007; EHRENBERG A, 1989; ESPING-ANDERSON G, 1990; FINDAHL O, 2009; GERSHUNY J, 2007; HELSPER E, 2008; KIEL J, 2005, DOI 10.1080/14639230500066900; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808089415; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MILLWARD P, 2003; NORRIS P, 2001; NOTTEN N, 2008; OXF INT S, 2009; ROGERS E, 2001, DOI 10.1177/135485650100700406; SELWYN N, 2004; SELWYN N, 2009, DOI 10.4018/978-1-60566-699-0.ch001; UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT P, 2008; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WARSCHAUER M, 2004; WEBSTER F, 2003; WILKINSON L, 1996; WORLD INT P, 2010",25,2011,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000288986900007,ISI,UNIV OXFORD,UNIV OXFORD,NA,"REISDORF BC, 2011, INFO COMMUN SOC","REISDORF BC, 2011, INFO COMMUN SOC",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/1369118x.2010.543141,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

NOT ONLY HAS IT BEEN DOUBTED THAT THE INTERNET IS ABLE TO MOBILIZE NEW SEGMENTS OF THE CITIZENRY, THE ABILITIES OF THOSE VIRTUALLY ACTIVE TO NAVIGATE THE POLITICAL SYSTEM HAVE ALSO BEEN CALLED INTO QUESTION. HENCE, THE PROBLEM CONCERNS A QUANTITATIVE ASPECT, INVOLVING THE WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE, AND A QUALITATIVE ASPECT, THAT IS, THE POLITICAL COMPETENCES OF INTERNET PARTICIPANTS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE INTERNET IN FINLAND MOBILIZES CITIZENS WHO ARE BOTH WILLING AND ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN POLITICAL MATTERS, BUT JUST HAPPENS TO PREFER ALTERNATIVE OUTLETS FOR THEIR POLITICAL PREFERENCES. THE DATA USED ARE THE FINNISH NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY 2007, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO GAUGE BOTH THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION VIA THE INTERNET. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE FINNISH ADULT POPULATION IS ONLY POLITICALLY ACTIVE VIA THE INTERNET. FURTHERMORE, THESE VIRTUAL CITIZENS ARE AT LEAST AS POLITICALLY COMPETENT AS TRADITIONAL ACTIVISTS, AND ON MOST ACCOUNTS EVEN MORE SO. ACCORDINGLY, IT SEEMS THE INTERNET MAY WELL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN VITALIZING THE CITIZENRIES OF THE ESTABLISHED DEMOCRACIES.","ABO AKAD UNIV, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND.","CHRISTENSEN, HS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ABO AKAD UNIV, FANRIKSGATAN 3A, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND.","ASBJORNSEN N, 1992; AYRES J, 1999, DOI 10.1177/0002716299566001011; BARBER B, 1984; BENGTSSON A, 2005; BENGTSSON A, 2009; BENNETT W, 2008, DOI 10.1080/10584600802197434; BEST S, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s11109-005-3242-y; BIMBER B, 2001, DOI 10.1177/106591290105400103; CARPINI M, 1993, DOI 10.2307/2111549; COLEMAN S, 2009; DALRYMPLE K, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1081180x07302881; DALTON R, 2006; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; FRANKLIN MARK N, 2004, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511616884; GALSTON W, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.217; GRONLUND K, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2007.00186.x; INGLEHART R, 1997, DOI 10.1515/9780691214429; JENNINGS M, 2003, DOI 10.1086/376947; KEETER S, 1997; MICHELETTI M, 2003, DOI 10.1057/9781403973764; MILNER H, 2002; MONDAK J, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2669369; MORALES L, 2009; MOSSBERGER K, 2008; NIEMI R, 1991, DOI 10.2307/1963953; NORRIS P, 2002; NORRIS P, 2000; NORRIS P, 2001; NORRIS P, 1999; PARVEZ Z, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600965609; PATEMAN C, 1970; PHARR S, 2000; PUTNAM ROBERT D, 2000; SCHEUFELE D, 2002, DOI 10.1177/1081180x0200700304; SCHUMPETER J, 1943; SHULMAN STUART W, 2004; TAYLOR P, 2004; TEORELL J, 2007; TOPF R, 1995; VERBA S, 1995; VERBA S, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s1537592703000458; VERBA S, 1971; XENOS M, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13691180701559897",26,2011,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000299820100007,ISI,ABO AKAD UNIV,ABO AKAD UNIV,NA,"CHRISTENSEN HS, 2011, INFO COMMUN SOC","CHRISTENSEN HS, 2011, INFO COMMUN SOC",FINLAND,10.1080/1369118x.2011.566931,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

HOWEVER, IT IS ONLY A THEORETICAL AND MACRO-SCALE PHENOMENON. LOWER SCALES (REGIONAL AND LOCAL PATTERNS) REFLECT ON THE OTHER HAND REAL (EMPIRICAL) INEQUALITIES IN THE INFORMATION AGE, AND DIFFERENT ANSWERS FOR COUNTRIES, REGIONS AND LOCALITIES. THE PAPER DEALS WITH POSSIBLE WAYS OF EXPLORING INEQUALITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES ON DIFFERENT (GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL) SCALES, WHILE CONCENTRATING ON SELECTED PROBLEMS OF THE SPATIAL LEVELS. IT ALSO EXPLORES HOW NATIONAL AND REGIONAL STRATEGIES INFLUENCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY IN THIS GLOBALIZED NETWORK CONTEXT. ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF THE PROFESSIONALS OF REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRATEGIES ARE QUESTIONABLE. HOWEVER, THERE WERE SOME GOOD EXAMPLES (E.G. THE NETWORK OF TELECOTTAGES) OF REGIONAL (LOCAL) INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAD ON THE OTHER HAND NOT MUCH CONNECTION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED STRATEGIES. AS A RESULT OF THE NOT ALWAYS PERFECT DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS, INEQUALITIES STILL EXIST BOTH WHEN WE LOOK AT HUNGARY AS A GLOBAL PARTICIPANT AND WITHIN HUNGARY AS A SET OF REGIONS AND LOCALITIES COMPETING FOR BETTER INFORMATION SOCIETY PERFORMANCE.","EOTVOS LORAND UNIV, BUDAPEST, HUNGARY.","JAKOBI, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), EOTVOS LORAND UNIV, BUDAPEST, HUNGARY.","BENNETT M K, 1954; CAIRNCROSS F, 1997; JAKOBI A, 2009; NORRIS P, 2001",0,2011,GEOGRAPHY; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000392971000018,ISI,EOTVOS LORAND UNIV,EOTVOS LORAND UNIV,NA,"JAKOBI A, 2011, NA","JAKOBI A, 2011, NA",HUNGARY,978-80-7368-963-6,978-80-7368-963-6,"GEOGRAPHY; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",0,UNIV OSTRAVA,NA,WOS

INFORM.,ARTICLE,MOBILE INTERNET; PRICE ELASTICITY; DIGITAL DIVIDE; THAILAND,ACCEPTANCE; ADOPTION; DEMAND; JAPAN; KOREA; PHONE,"MOBILE INTERNET IS GROWING AROUND THE WORLD, BYPASSING THE POOR LEGACY OF WIRED INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS GROWTH CAN BE OBSERVED EVEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES LIKE THAILAND. TO COPE WITH THIS TREND, THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO A NATIONAL REGULATORY AGENCY (NRA) BY ADDRESSING THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE KEY DETERMINANT FACTORS FOR INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER TO ACCESS MOBILE INTERNET? A DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL IS EMPLOYED TO EXAMINE EMPIRICALLY WHETHER PRICE, SERVICE, AND APPLICATION ATTRIBUTES, SOCIO-ECONOMIC VARIABLES, AND SERVICE PROVIDER HAVE A SYSTEMATIC LINK WITH THE DECISION OF THE CONSUMER. THE DATA FROM A NATIONAL SURVEY IN 2010 COMMISSIONED BY THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (NTC) OF THAILAND ARE USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PRICE, AVAILABILITY OF FIXED TELEPHONY, AGE, AND LIVING AREA ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE STRONGEST DETERMINANTS FOR MOBILE INTERNET ADOPTION. THE FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST THAT MOBILE INTERNET COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, AS THE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT DOES NOT HAVE FIXED INTERNET CONNECTION AT HOME CAN CONNECT VIA MOBILE INTERNET. THE PRICE OF MOBILE INTERNET SERVICE IS INELASTIC, HOWEVER, WHICH MEANS THAT AN INCREASE IN PRICE DOES NOT AFFECT THE PROPENSITY TO ACCESS MOBILE INTERNET. THIS IS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF COMPETITION IN FIXED CONNECTION DUE TO THE CONCESSION, AND IT LEADS TO LIMITED CHOICE FOR THE CONSUMER. TELECOM REGULATORS AND POLICYMAKERS THEREFORE NEED TO CONSIDER POLICIES SUCH AS INCREASING COMPETITION AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO STIMULATE GROWTH OF MOBILE INTERNET ADOPTION AND CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THAILAND.

THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AS IT TREATS USERS IN EMERGING MARKETS AS SOMEHOW INHERENTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE WEST.

THE THEORY NOT ONLY EXPLAINS SPANIARDS' INTERNET USE AND MORE RECENT EMPIRICAL FINDINGS BUT ALSO PROPOSES ANSWERS TO CRITICAL CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND THE DIGITAL INEQUALITY DEBATE.","UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, SCH BUSINESS & ECON, DEPT BUSINESS ECON, E-08193 BARCELONA, SPAIN.;  UNIV GIRONA, DEPT ECON, GIRONA 17071, SPAIN.;  UNIV ROVIRA & VIRGILI, TARRAGONA, SPAIN.","LOPEZ-SINTAS, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, SCH BUSINESS & ECON, DEPT BUSINESS ECON, EDIFICI B, E-08193 BARCELONA, SPAIN.","AMBROGI F, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.cmpb.2005.03.001; ANDERSON B, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121957295; ASLANIDOU S, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2007.12.003; BLASIUS J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2007.12.001; BOURDIEU P, 1989; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BUCY E, 2000, DOI 10.1162/108118000568967; CHATMAN E, 1991, DOI 10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199107)42:6<438::aid-asi6>3.0.cob; DENNIS N, 1969; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DOUGLAS M, 2021; FRANZEN A, 2003, DOI 10.1046/j.0023-5962.2003.00224.x; GIDDENS A, 1984; GIDDENS A, 1973; GIFI A, 1981; GOLDFARB A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001; GOLDTHORPE J, 1963, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-954x.1963.tb01230.x; GREENACRE M, 1993; GREENACRE M, 1994; HAMPTON K, 2001; JACKSON J E, 2005; JOLLIFFE I, 2002, DOI 10.1007/b98835; KOKU E, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121958023; KRAUT R, 1998, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.53.9.1017; KRAUT R, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1540-4560.00248; LE ROUX B, 2004, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-2236-0; LEBART L, 1984; MENGER P, 1999, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.25.1.541; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; NIE N, 2000, DOI 10.1177/0894439302238972; NISHISATO S, 1994; NISHISATO S, 1980; NOTTEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1093/esr/jcn071; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2000, DOI 10.1287/orsc.11.4.404.14600; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; R CORE T, 2021; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROUANET H, 2004; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VENABLES W, 2002; WARSCHAUER M, 2003; WELLMAN B, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121957286; WOLFF H, 2009, DOI 10.1037/a0013350; ZILLIEN N, 2007; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",8,2012,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000300418200009,ISI,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;UNIV GIRONA;UNIV ROVIRA AND VIRGILI,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,NA,"LOPEZ-SINTAS J, 2012, SOC SCI COMPUT REV","LOPEZ-SINTAS J, 2012, SOC SCI COMPUT REV",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1177/0894439310390611,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"SPANISH MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE; EUROPEAN UNION ERDF [ECO2008-04101-ECON]; COMMISSION FOR UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH OF THE MINISTRY OF INNOVATION, UNIVERSITIES AND ENTERPRISES OF THE AUTONOMOUS GOVERNMENT OF CATALONIA [2009-SGR-411]; CENTRE FOR RESEARCH AND STUDIES IN ECONOMICS (CER.HUMANITATS-UAB)",WOS

WE WILL ALSO EXPLAIN SOME IMPORTANT MEASURES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED IN ADULT EDUCATION IN THE ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN NORWAY. IN NORWAY - AS IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES - WE ARE EXPERIENCING A GROWING DIGITALIZATION OF OUR SOCIETY. WE PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES ONLINE, WE READ THE NEWS ON THE INTERNET, AND WE SOCIALIZE ONLINE. MOREOVER, THE NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DIGITIZING THE PUBLIC SERVICE SECTOR. IT IS EXPECTED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED INFORMATION THROUGH THIS CHANNEL AND THEREFORE IT IS IMPORTANT TO ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THE CITIZENS TO OBTAIN SUCH INFORMATION, TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOME FAIL TO MASTER THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF SKILLS IN THE POPULATION. DIGITAL DIVIDES AND DIFFERENCES: MOST PEOPLE IN NORWAY HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AND THE INTERNET. FIGURES FROM STATISTICS NORWAY SHOW THAT NEARLY 90 PER CENT OF NORWEGIAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ONE OR MORE COMPUTERS (SSB 2011). HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH ALMOST EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO A PC AND THE INTERNET, THERE ARE STILL LARGE VARIATIONS IN DIGITAL SKILLS WITHIN DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS IN THE POPULATION. THERE IS A CLEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE, LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND DIGITAL COMPETENCE. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT DIGITAL SKILLS ARE LINKED TO PEOPLE'S RELATION TO THE LABOR MARKET. THE DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS LOWER AMONG IMMIGRANTS, AND THE COMPETENCE IS ESPECIALLY LOW AMONGST IMMIGRANT WOMEN. MANY ARE STILL LEFT BEHIND IN TODAY'S DIGITAL SOCIETY. ONE IN FOUR NORWEGIAN MASTER TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY ONLY TO A MINOR EXTENT. THE CORRESPONDING FIGURE FOR IMMIGRANTS IN NORWAY IS 41 PER CENT. FROM 2008 TO 2010 THERE WERE ONLY SMALL CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN THE SOCIETY. A RELATIVELY LARGE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION HAVE LIMITED OR NO EXPERIENCE IN USING DIGITAL TOOLS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE GROUPS CAN BE CHALLENGING IN A SOCIETY WITH INCREASING REQUIREMENTS TO DIGITAL SKILLS. EMPIRICAL STUDIES - MEASURING DIGITAL COMPETENCE: VOX HAS ANALYZED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT SURVEYS IN THE PERIOD 2008 TO 2011. THE PURPOSE OF THE SURVEYS WAS TO PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE ON THE LEVEL OF COMPUTER AND INTERNET LITERACY IN THE POPULATION: WHO MASTERS THE DIGITAL SOCIETY, AND WHO DOES NOT? THE FIRST SURVEY, ""THE DIGITAL CITIZEN - AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN THE NORWEGIAN POPULATION"" FROM 2008, WAS DIRECTED TO A REPRESENTATIVE SELECTION OF THE NORWEGIAN POPULATION ABOVE THE AGE OF 16. THE SECOND SURVEY, ""IMMIGRANTS CONNECTED"" (2010), FOCUSED ON THE SIX LARGEST IMMIGRANT GROUPS IN NORWAY, WHILE THE THIRD SURVEY, ""MANY STILL LEFT BEHIND"" (2011), WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE FIRST SURVEY CONDUCTED IN 2008. DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS DEFINED AS ""THE SUM OF VARIOUS DIGITAL SKILLS"" IN ALL THE SURVEYS CARRIED OUT BY VOX. THE STUDIES ARE INSPIRED BY THE WORK OF EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE (ETS) FROM 2001, WHERE AN INTERNATIONAL PANEL REVIEWED THE IMPORTANCE OF EXISTING AND EMERGING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND HOW VARIOUS SKILLS COULD BE CATEGORIZED. THE SKILLS WERE MEASURED ON THE BASIS OF EIGHT ICT AREAS.","NORWEGIAN AGCY LIFELONG LEARNING, VOX, OSLO, NORWAY.",NA,"GUTHU L, 2011; GUTHU L, 2010; GUTHU L, 2008",0,2012,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000318422204137,ISI,NA,NOTREPORTED,NA,"GUTHU L, 2012, NA","GUTHU L, 2012, NA",NORWAY,978-84-616-0763-1,978-84-616-0763-1,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION A& DEVELOPMENT,NA,WOS

DIGITAL COMMUNICATION INEQUALITIES ARISE WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS INFLUENCE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THIS EMERGING COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, A PROCESS THAT IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT AMONG THE YOUNG. WHILE COMMUNICATION INEQUALITIES HAVE BEEN THE OBJECT OF MUCH THEORETICAL AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, THEIR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REMAINS UNATTENDED. WE USED RECENT EUROSTAT MICRO-DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW DEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIOECONOMIC AND CULTURAL FACTORS AFFECT COMMUNICATION INEQUALITIES IN EUROPE, PERFORMING A DETAILED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE SPANISH CASE. WE FOUND THAT THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEW MEDIA ECOLOGY BY UPLOADING SELF-CREATED CONTENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED TO THE ACTIVITY OF DOWNLOADING ONLINE MATERIAL, AN ASSOCIATION THAT, AT THIS STAGE, IS MORE RELEVANT THAN THE ONE OBSERVED FOR OTHER FACTORS. AT ONE POINT, YOUNG EUROPEAN ""DOWNLOADERS"" START TO UPLOAD AND CONTRIBUTE, A CULTURAL MECHANISM THAT IS CURRENTLY DRIVING INCLUSION MORE STRONGLY THAN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AVENUES THAT ARE NORMALLY CONSIDERED IN THE LITERATURE ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

YET, OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DIVIDE SUCH AS LOW LITERACY RATES, GENDER AND RELIGIOUS ISSUES ARGUABLY POSE BIGGER HURDLES IN GETTING THE BENEFITS OF THE INTERNET TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THEY ARE SELDOM AWARE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE NET AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARE, THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY USING IT. TO FACILITATE ACCESS AND USE OF THE INTERNET BY THE POPULATION, AN INTERMEDIARY IS OFTEN NEEDED. WHILE CASE STUDIES IN THE LITERATURE HAVE SHOWN SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF SUCH INTERMEDIARIES, THE ROLE OF THIS ENTITY HAS NOT BEEN CONCEPTUALLY EXAMINED.

OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ONLINE SKILLS AS A PREREQUISITE FOR USING ONLINE NEWS MEDIA AND FEATURES SHOULD BE CENTRALLY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN FUTURE RESEARCH.","FAC LANGUAGE & COMMUN LESSIUS ANTWERP, ANTWERP, BELGIUM.;  KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN, INST MEDIA STUDIES, LOUVAIN, BELGIUM.","OPGENHAFFEN, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), FAC LANGUAGE & COMMUN LESSIUS ANTWERP, ANTWERP, BELGIUM.","ANDERSON K, 2001, DOI 10.1080/07448480109595707; BLUMLER J, 1979, DOI 10.1177/009365027900600102; BOCZKOWSKI P, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0002716204270067; CHARNEY T, 2001; CHUNG D, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.00414.x; CHUNG D, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807072217; DAHLGREN P, 1996, DOI 10.1080/13183222.1996.11008632; DALRYMPLE K, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1081180x07302881; DEUZE M, 2003, DOI 10.1177/1461444803005002004; DEUZE M, 1999, DOI 10.1177/0016549299061005002; DEUZE M, 2001; DIDDI A, 2006, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem5002_2; DROTNER K, 2002; ESSER F, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0002764207299364; EVELAND W, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00299.x; EVELAND W, 2004, DOI 10.1080/10584600490443877; EVELAND W, 2002, DOI 10.1207/s1532785xmep0404_03; EVELAND W, 2002, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4601_3; FERGUSON D, 2000, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4402_1; FORTSON B, 2007, DOI 10.3200/jach.56.2.137-146; FRANKLIN B, 2005; GOLUB Y, 2007; HARGITTAI E, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x; HARGITTAI E, 2003, DOI 10.1002/anie.200602280; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HARGITTAI E, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308318213; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HEETER C, 1989; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HONG Y, 2007, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2006.9973; HOWARD P, 2001; JONES S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01439.x; KAYE B K, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0736-5853(03)00037-6; KINNALLY W, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808096250; KWAK N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0093650204271400; LIVINGSTONE S, 2005; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; MANOVICH L, 2002; MCMILLAN S, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1461444806059871; METZGER M, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(03)00049-6; MITCHELSTEIN E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809350193; MITRA A, 2005; OBLAK T, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0016549205049180; OGAN C, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0894439307306129; OPGENHAFFEN M, 2008; OPGENHAFFEN M, 2008; OPGENHAFFEN M, 2011; PAPACHARISSI Z, 2000, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4402_2; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; PEW I, 2004; PEW I, 2008; PEW I, 2009; PEW I, 2002; PINGREE S, 1988; POINDEXTER P, 2001, DOI 10.1177/107769900107800108; RAACKE J, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0056; SCHEUFELE D, 2000, DOI 10.1177/107769900007700402; STEMPEL G, 2000, DOI 10.1177/107769900007700106; STEUER J, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1992.tb00812.x; STOLL C, 1995; SUNDAR S, 2008, DOI 10.1162/dmal.9780262562324.073; TEDESCO J, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0002764207300041; TEWKSBURY D, 2000, DOI 10.1177/107769900007700301; THAYER S, 2006, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2006.9.432; TREMAYNE M, 2001, DOI 10.1177/1075547001023002003; TSAI M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2009.11.004; VALENZUELA S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VEGLIS A, 2007; WARNICK B, 2005; WEISER E, 2000, DOI 10.1089/109493100316012; WISE K, 2008, DOI 10.1080/08838150701820858; YANG J, 2004; YOFFIE D, 1997",5,2012,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000309034700005,ISI,FAC LANGUAGE AND COMMUN LESSIUS ANTWERP;KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN,M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"OPGENHAFFEN M, 2012, COMMUNICATIONS","OPGENHAFFEN M, 2012, COMMUNICATIONS",BELGIUM;BELGIUM,10.1515/commun-2012-0016,NA,COMMUNICATION,5,DE GRUYTER MOUTON,NA,WOS

THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A BARRIER TO ACHIEVING THIS GOAL BECAUSE IT EXPRESSES THE INABILITY TO ACCESS, IN THEIR VARIOUS FORMS, THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND, ULTIMATELY, TO ACCESS DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP. THE SCOPE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, BUT ALSO IN AREAS WITH DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, AS IN THE CASE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, WHERE THERE IS GREAT DIVERSITY AMONG THE MEMBER COUNTRIES. IN THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS, AND SPECIFICALLY IN EUROPE, SOME GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROMOTED THE IDEA THAT ICT IS A STRATEGIC SECTOR FOR GROWTH AND JOB CREATION -AS STATED BY THE EU MINISTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY IN THE GRANADA DECLARATION OF 19 APRIL 2010. FOLLOWING THIS GUIDELINE, EUROPE WOULD REACH A HIGH LEVEL IN THE GLOBAL DIGITAL ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES' MARKET. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS AN INCLUSIVE POLICY AIMED AT A NEW EUROPEAN CITIZENSHIP, IN OTHER WORDS DIGITALLY PREPARED AND ACTIVE USERS. CONSEQUENTLY AND ACCORDING TO THESE PRINCIPLES, GOVERNMENTS SHOULD COMMIT MORE TO THIS SECTOR, EXTENDING ITS USE AND BENEFITS TO THE GENERAL POPULATION, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE LIFE. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE GENERAL GUIDELINES, NOT ALL COUNTRIES HAVE ADDRESSED DIGITAL INCLUSION EQUALLY IN BOTH CONTENT AND SCOPE. THROUGH THIS PAPER WE AIM TO PROVIDE A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THESE E-INCLUSIVE STRATEGIES.","UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, FAC SOCIAL SCI & COMMUN, DEPT POLIT SCI & ADM, BILBAO, SPAIN.","DEL OLMO, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, FAC SOCIAL SCI & COMMUN, DEPT POLIT SCI & ADM, BILBAO, SPAIN.","CLEMENT A, 2000; CRANDALL M, 2009; CRIADO J I, 2009, DOI 10.3233/ip-2009-0192; ESPINGANDERSON G, 1990; FERNANDEZ-I-MARIN X, 2011, DOI 10.2202/1944-2866.1093; HARRIS R, 2004; MORALES J M R, 2010; MOSSBERGER K, 2008; NORRIS P, 2001",0,2012,GOVERNMENT & LAW; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000308239000051,ISI,UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY,UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY,NA,"DEL OLMO AM, 2012, NA","DEL OLMO AM, 2012, NA",SPAIN,978-1-908272-42-3,978-1-908272-42-3,POLITICAL SCIENCE; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NA,WOS

SECOND, PRIOR WORK HAS FOCUSED LARGELY ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF WEB 2.0 FOR PRODUCERS OF CONTENT, USUALLY CORPORATIONS OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THIS PAPER IS ONE OF THE FEW ANALYSES OF WEB 2.0 FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF USERS. THIRD, WE CHARACTERIZE THE CREATIVE ACTIVITY OF WEB 2.0 USERS. IN ADDITION TO THEIR ACTIVE CONTENT PRODUCTION, THEY ARE UNUSUALLY ACTIVE USERS OF THE INTERNET FOR ENTERTAINMENT. IN MULTIVARIATE MODELS PREDICTING WEB 2.0, THE MOST CONSISTENTLY IMPORTANT VARIABLES ARE TECHNICAL ABILITY, COMFORT REVEALING PERSONAL DATA AND, PARTICULARLY, WEB 2.0 CONFIDENCE. THESE VARIABLES SUGGEST THAT DESPITE THE APPARENT SIMPLICITY OF FACEBOOK OR OF TYPING A BOOK REVIEW ON AMAZON, ABILITY REMAINS VERY IMPORTANT IN THE EYES OF USERS. FOR MANY, THERE APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING DAUNTING ABOUT CONTRIBUTING TO WEB 2.0 ACTIVITY AND MANY POTENTIAL USERS REMAIN, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, UNCERTAIN OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION.

HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF HELPING OVERCOME SOCIETY'S INQUALITIES CAUSED BY THE DIGITAL ERA, THEY HAVE INSTIGATED AN INCREASE OF THE PEOPLE THAT RESTED ASIDE OF THE INFORMATION AGE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE REFERS TO THE DIFFICULTY INFO-EXCLUDED PEOPLE HAVE IN KEEPING UP WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. THIS PHENOMENON WAS TRIGGERED BY THE RAPID GROWTH AND DISSEMINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT, AS A PORTION OF SOCIETY DID NOT HAVE THE PROPER TIME OR KNOWLEDGE TO ADJUST. THIS PAPER SETS FORTH A NEW APPROACH TO HELP FIGHT THE PORTUGUESE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY PRESENTING NEW WAYS OF INTERACTION. RESORTING TO MULTI-TOUCH TECHNOLOGY, WE EXAMINE HOW THIS NEW NATURAL INTERACTION PARADIGM CAN HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST INFO-EXCLUSION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE PRESENT A MULTI-TOUCH GAME ENVISIONED TO ENCOURAGE AND TEACH DIGITALLY EXCLUDED PEOPLE ON HOW TO USE AN IMPORTANT AND NEEDED EVERYDAY EQUIPMENT - THE ATM (AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINE) - AS IT IS STILL AVOIDED BY SOME. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PILOT CASE STUDY CAN SHOW PRELIMINARY RESULTS ON HOW NATURAL USER INTERFACES MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO HELP OVERCOME SOME DIFFICULTIES ENFORCED BY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE CONSIDER THAT OUR FINDINGS MAY BE VALUABLE TO SHOW A POSSIBLE PATH OF HOW THE NEW NATURAL USER INTERFACES CAN HELP BRING TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE CLOSER. AFTER BEING ASKED ABOUT THEIR USER EXPERIENCE, THE PARTICIPANTS OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY AGREED THAT THE GAME ENCOURAGED THEM TO EXPLORE MORE ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES. (C) 2012 THE AUTHORS.

THIS HAS MEANT THAT THERE IS A SHIFT IN THE CONVENTIONAL MODE OF PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY FROM A FACE-TO-FACE AND TELEPHONE MODE TO ELECTRONIC MEANS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL THE CITIZENS ARE MAKING USE OF THESE CHANGES, AND THE ONE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT IS CURRENTLY ATTRACTING IMMENSE INTEREST RELATED TO THEIR WELFARE, HEALTH AND OTHER SUCH ISSUES IS THE OLDER AGE GROUP. USING THIS AS A REASON, THE AIM OF THIS EXPLORATORY AND EXPLANATORY RESEARCH WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE E-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES IN THE UK, MORE SPECIFICALLY IN LONDON. TO CONDUCT THIS RESEARCH, A MIXED QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH WAS PURSUED. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE INTERNET TO MANY OF THE USERS IS RELATIVE, DEPENDING ON THE AGE, PERCEPTIONS AND LEVEL OF INNOVATIVENESS OF THE USER. IT WAS LEARNT THAT IN RELATION TO QUALITY, THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WEBSITES DO CONTAIN USEFUL AND RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR THE ELDERLY. HOWEVER, THIS INFORMATION IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS, MAINLY DUE TO THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS IN THE USE OF COMPUTERS OR INTERNET. FROM THIS RESEARCH, IT IS EXPECTED THAT A CONTRIBUTION TO ACADEMIA WILL EMERGE IN THE FORM OF A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES RELATED TO E-GOVERNMENT, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND OLDER CITIZENS. FOR INDUSTRY, THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS RESEARCH ARE THE IDENTIFICATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES RELATED TO ONLINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE OLDER CITIZEN. FOR POLICY-MAKERS, THIS RESEARCH PROFFERS AN UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES RELATED WITH DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF ONLINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING.","UNIV HERTFORDSHIRE, SYST MANAGEMENT RES UNIT SYMRU, SCH BUSINESS, HATFIELD AL10 9EU, HERTS, ENGLAND.;  BRUNEL UNIV, SCH INFORMAT SYST COMP & MATH, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND.","GHINEA, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), BRUNEL UNIV, SCH INFORMAT SYST COMP & MATH, UXBRIDGE UB8 3PH, MIDDX, ENGLAND.","ANCARANI A, 2005, DOI 10.1108/09604520510575236; ARIELY D, 2000, DOI 10.1086/314322; BAROUDI J, 1986, DOI 10.1145/5666.5669; BECKFORD J, 2002; BELANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; BERTOT J, 2006; BERTOT JOHN C, 2006, DOI 10.5210/fm.v11i9.1392; BRYMAN A, 1984, DOI 10.2307/590553; BSI (BRITISH STANDARDS I, 2010; BUCKLEY J, 2003, DOI 10.1108/09604520310506513; CABINET O, 1999; CARPENTER B, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2006.08.015; CARTER L, 2005; CHADWICK A, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0894439303256372; CHOUDRIE J, 2010, DOI 10.1504/eg.2010.030925; CHOUDRIE J, 2004; CHOUDRIE J, 2008; CODY M, 1999, DOI 10.1080/03634529909379178; CRONIN J, 1992, DOI 10.2307/1252296; CULLEN R, 2001, DOI 10.1108/14684520110410517; CULLEN R, 2003; DABHOLKAR P, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0022-4359(00)00029-4; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DHOLAKIA U, 1998; DUGDALE A, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0020852305051687; EBRAHIM Z, 2005; EISMA R, 2004, DOI 10.1007/s10209-004-0092-z; EMIS, 2011; EUROPEAN C, 2008; FLAK L, 2005; FOWLER A, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0263-7863(97)00063-x; FREEMAN C, 1997; FRIEDMAN B, 2000, DOI 10.1145/355112.355120; GARCIA A, 2005; GARVIN D, 1984; GILBERT D, 2004, DOI 10.1108/09513550410539794; GRONROOS C, 1984, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000004784; HERTZUM M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/10447311003781300; HILL R, 2008, DOI 10.1108/09593840810896019; HOFFMAN D L, 1997, DOI 10.1080/019722497129278; HUEMANN M, 2004; IRIZARRY C, 1997, DOI 10.1111/j.1741-6612.1997.tb01042.x; JAEGER P, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.07.008; KANTNER L, 2003; KATZ J, 1997, DOI 10.1108/10662249710171814; KAYNAMA S A, 2000, DOI 10.1300/j090v21n01_05; KERVIN J, 1992; KURNIAWAN S, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1090785.1090810; KUZMA J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2009.10.004; LAZAR J, 2012; LEHTINEN U, 1991, DOI 10.1080/02642069100000047; LINES L, 2002; LOW INCOMES TAX REFORM G, 2012; MARCHIONINI G, 2003; MOORE G, 1991, DOI 10.1287/isre.2.3.192; MORRIS A, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10209-006-0057-5; MORRIS A, 2007; NATIONAL AUDIT O, 2003; NETMECHANIC, 2010; NEWELL A F, 2006, DOI 10.1145/1183456.1183459; NEWELL A, 2007; NIELSEN J, 1998; NIELSEN J, 1994; NIELSEN J, 1993; NORRIS P, 2001; NOVAK T, 2000, DOI 10.1287/mksc.19.1.22.15184; OFCOM, 2010; OFFICE FOR NATIONAL S, 2008; PARASURAMAN A, 1988; PARASURAMAN A, 1985, DOI 10.2307/1251430; PICK JAMES B, 2008, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20095; RICE M, 1997; RIEDL R, 2006; ROGERS E, 1995; ROSE G, 1999; SANDHU J, 1993, DOI 10.1016/0003-6870(93)90157-5; SAUNDERS M, 2003; SCHWESTER R, 2009; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SHEEHAN KIM B, 2001, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2001.tb00117.; SHNEIDERMAN B, 2000, DOI 10.1145/332833.332843; SIPIOR J, 2005; TASHAKKORI A, 1998; TEAS R, 1993, DOI 10.2307/1252216; VAN DIJK J, 2000; VANDYKE T, 1997, DOI 10.2307/249419; VENKATESH V, 2000, DOI 10.2307/3250981; WAGNER N, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.029; WEARE C, 2002; WHITE J, 2000, DOI 10.1080/036012700407857; WOODS B, 2003, DOI 10.1002/cpp.363; WRIGHT K, 2000, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2000.tb02855.x; ZAJICEK M, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2004.04.003; ZEITHAML V, 1981; ZEITHAML V, 2002, DOI 10.1177/009207002236911",31,2013,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000325765200001,ISI,UNIV HERTFORDSHIRE;BRUNEL UNIV,BRUNEL UNIV,NA,"CHOUDRIE J, 2013, INTERACT COMPUT","CHOUDRIE J, 2013, INTERACT COMPUT",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1093/iwc/iws020,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, CYBERNETICS; ERGONOMICS",31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,NA,WOS

INTERNET USE YIELDS DIRECT UTILITY AND ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT MAY INCREASE LIFE SATISFACTION. BUT THE INTERNET MIGHT ALSO HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS (E.G. ADDICTION, SOCIAL ISOLATION). THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF INTERNET USE ON INDIVIDUAL WELL-BEING. USING LUXEMBURGISH DATA EXTRACTED FROM THE EUROPEAN VALUE SURVEY, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT NON USERS ARE LESS SATISFIED IN THEIR LIFE THAN INTERNET USERS.

THESE TRENDS PROVIDE NEW CHALLENGES FOR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHERS AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVELS, REQUIRING ATTENTION TO THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS IN AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. NEW EVIDENCE, WHICH BUILDS ON EARLIER CLAIMS OF AN INCREASING DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, HAS SHOWN THAT THIS PHENOMENON IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN WAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. WE SUGGEST THAT A PROMISING WAY TO MAXIMIZE THE KNOWLEDGE AND IMPACT OF RESEARCHING IT IN EDUCATION IS TO ESTABLISH LONGITUDINAL PROGRAMMATIC RESEARCH SUSTAINED THROUGH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF E-LEARNING OBSERVATORIES, WHICH CAN BRING TOGETHER EXPERTISE ACROSS A RANGE OF DISCIPLINES. A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN FORMING A CLEAR AND COHERENT STRATEGY FOR RESEARCHING IT IN EDUCATION LIES IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS WITH DIFFERING AIMS, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES.

HARAMBAM J; AUPERS S; HOUTMAN D,THE CONTENTIOUS GAP: FROM DIGITAL DIVIDE TO CULTURAL BELIEFS ABOUT ONLINE INTERACTIONS,INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,INFO. COMMUN. SOC.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; ONLINE SOCIAL CONTACT; CULTURAL ATTITUDES; INEQUALITY,PEOPLES INTERNET USE; NATIVES DEBATE; SKILLS,"WITH THE RISE AND WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF THE INTERNET, SOCIAL SCIENTISTS RAPIDLY EMPHASIZED THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE BETTER ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THESE TECHNOLOGIES THAN OTHERS. THIS SO-CALLED DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE-NOTS WAS SEEN AS A NEW FEATURE OF CONTEMPORARY INEQUALITY - AS A REPRODUCTION OR TRANSFORMATION OF EXISTING SOCIAL DISPARITIES. MOTIVATED BY THESE CONCERNS ABOUT SOCIAL INEQUALITY, IT IS ARGUED IN THIS PAPER, RESEARCH ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS BEEN THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY BLINKERED. EVEN THOUGH THE FOCUS CHANGED FROM SIMPLISTIC QUESTIONS OF HAVING ACCESS OR NOT, TOWARDS THE MORE INFORMATIVE DIMENSION OF USAGE AND SKILLS, THE SAME SOCIO-ECONOMIC BIAS WAS MAINTAINED. IN THIS PAPER, WE THEREFORE THEORIZE THAT APPROPRIATING THE INTERNET (OR NOT) IS LESS RELATED TO SOCIO-ECONOMIC POSITION OR USAGE AND SKILLS, AND IS MORE CULTURALLY INFORMED THAN THEORIES ABOUT A DIGITAL DIVIDE ALLOW FOR. TO EMPIRICALLY TEST OUR ASSUMPTIONS, WE USED THE INTERNET-BASED COMMUNITY PROJECT TELEBRINK' AS A CASE STUDY FOR OUR QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH. BASED ON A SURVEY AMONG DUTCH CITIZENS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT (N=251), WE STUDIED THE EXPLANATIONS FOR (NOT) USING THESE APPLICATIONS BY TESTING HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE ON THE ONE HAND AND CULTURE, I.E. MORAL EVALUATIONS OF ONLINE SOCIAL LIFE, ON THE OTHER. OUR STATISTICAL ANALYSES SHOW THAT CULTURAL ATTITUDES, I.E. MORAL BELIEFS REGARDING SOCIAL INTERACTION, ARE MOST STRONGLY EXPLAINING THE APPROPRIATION OF SOCIAL INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES. ENRICHED WITH OUR QUALITATIVE DATA CONFIRMING THOSE RESULTS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT HOW PEOPLE FEEL AND THINK ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIAL LIFE IS OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE.

HIS PLACE IN THE ANNALS OF JOURNALISM IS SECURE, BUT HIS LEGACY SHOULD NOT STOP THERE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES FOR A FRESH INTERPRETATION OF LIPPMANN AS AN EARLY THEORIST OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. THIS THESIS RESTS ON THREE PROPOSITIONS. FIRST, IN PUBLIC OPINION AND OTHER LESS FAMOUS BOOKS, LIPPMANN FOCUSED PRODUCTIVELY ON THE EMPIRICAL AND NORMATIVE ASPECTS OF INFORMATION'S ROLE IN A DEMOCRATIC POLITY.

TWO PRIMARY REASONS, HOWEVER, NECESSITATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW METHODS TO MANAGE MOBILE DIFFUSION IN THESE COUNTRIES. FIRST, THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL IMPACTS INVOLVED ARE MORE PRONOUNCED THERE. SECOND, LOW INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY LIMITS EFFICIENT REGULATION AND STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, THE CONSEQUENCE IS A WIDENING OF THE INTRA-COUNTRY DIGITAL DIVIDE IN COUNTRIES LIKE PAKISTAN. THIS PAPER EMBRACES BOTH AN ESTIMATION COMPONENT AND A POLICY SCENARIO COMPONENT. WE CALL ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE MOBILE SUBSCRIBERS TO GAUGE THE INTENSITY OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN A COUNTRY. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS APPROACH OFFERS ADVANTAGES OVER PURELY STATISTICAL ESTIMATION MODELS IN THAT IT ENABLES DYNAMIC EXPLORATORY POLICY ASSESSMENTS BY THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES AND RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. FURTHER A SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODEL CAN BE EMBEDDED WITHIN AN INTERFACE WHICH ALLOWS EASIER MODEL USE BY THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE METHODOLOGY OR THE SOFTWARE EMPLOYED. THIS ALLOWS DISSEMINATION OF AN EFFECTIVE POLICYMAKING AID DESPITE LOW INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. EMPLOYING THE SYSTEM DYNAMICS METHODOLOGY, WE ESTIMATE THE RATE OF DIFFUSION, IDENTIFY ITS MAJOR DETERMINANTS AND THE TRUE MARKET SIZE IN THE CASE OF PAKISTAN. THIS RESEARCH CAN BE USEFUL FOR POLICYMAKING AND BUSINESS STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT IN, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. (C) 2012 ELSEVIER INC.

THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS EXAMINED IN FOUR DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS: (I) BETWEEN STUDENTS IN URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS IN RURAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS; (II) BETWEEN STUDENTS IN RURAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS IN PRIVATE MIGRANT SCHOOLS; (III) BETWEEN MIGRANT STUDENTS IN URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND MIGRANT STUDENTS IN PRIVATE MIGRANT SCHOOLS; AND (IV) BETWEEN STUDENTS IN HAN-DOMINATED RURAL AREAS AND STUDENTS IN AREAS INHABITED BY ETHNIC MINORITIES.

THE GAP WIDENS FURTHER WHEN COMPARING URBAN STUDENTS TO STUDENTS FROM MINORITY AREAS. THE DIVIDE IS ALSO LARGE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOLS WHEN EXAMINING THE QUALITY OF COMPUTER INSTRUCTION AND ACCESS TO LEARNING SOFTWARE. MIGRATION DOES NOT APPEAR TO ELIMINATE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, UNLESS MIGRANT FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO ENROLL THEIR CHILDREN IN URBAN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

WITH THE INTERNET IT IS DRAMATICALLY EASIER, FASTER, AND CHEAPER. SOME ARGUE THAT THIS WILL MOVE CREATION OUT OF THE HANDS OF ELITES AND LEAD TO WIDER PARTICIPATION IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND TO ENHANCED DEMOCRACY. THIS PAPER MAKES THREE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS DEBATE. FIRST, IT USES A NATIONAL RANDOM SAMPLE OF THE BRITISH POPULATION. THIS IS MUCH BROADER THAN MOST PRIOR WORK. SECOND, IT CREATES THE FIRST EVIDENCE-BASED TYPOLOGY OF INTERNET CONTENT CREATION, IDENTIFYING THREE TYPES NAMED SKILLED CONTENT', SOCIAL AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT', AND POLITICAL CONTENT'. THE IMPLICIT ASSUMPTION OF MANY RESEARCHERS THAT ONLY ONE TYPE OF CONTENT EXISTS IS NOT ACCURATE. THIRD, USING MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION IT SHOWS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS THAT PRODUCE EACH TYPE OF CONTENT. ELITES HAVE NO IMPACT ON CREATION OF SKILLED CONTENT. SOCIAL AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE CREATED BY NON-ELITES. ONLY CREATION OF POLITICAL CONTENT IS SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ELITE STATUS.

THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE, INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL, REPEATED CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA (N?=?47,001) COLLECTED IN ANNUAL SURVEYS IN THE UK BETWEEN 2002 AND 2010. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSES SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH INTERNET ACCESS AND USE HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PERIOD STUDIED, BOTH CONTINUE TO BE STRUCTURED ACCORDING TO OCCUPATIONAL CLASS, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AND, TO SOME EXTENT, AGE. THE SEX AND ETHNICITY OF RESPONDENTS HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THE PROBABILITY OF REPORTING INTERNET ACCESS AND WERE ONLY STRONGLY RELATED TO USING THE INTERNET FOR PURCHASING GOODS OR SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRESENCE OF CHILDREN IN A HOUSEHOLD WAS UNIMPORTANT IN RELATION TO BOTH INTERNET ACCESS OR USE. WHILE THE FINDINGS DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES THEY CONFIRM THAT BOTH INTERNET ACCESS AND USE REMAIN STRUCTURED ALONG SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND EDUCATIONAL LINES THAT WORK AGAINST ALREADY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. THIS HAS REMAINED THE CASE IN THE UK THROUGHOUT THE 2000S DESPITE CONSIDERABLE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND POLICY INTERVENTIONS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING MARGINALIZED SECTIONS OF SOCIETY. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT POLICY INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT BOTH INCREASING AND WIDENING INTERNET ACCESS AND USE WILL BE INEFFECTIVE UNLESS THE SOCIAL, RATHER THAN TECHNOLOGICAL, BASIS OF INEQUALITIES IN ACCESS AND USE ARE RECOGNIZED.","UNIV LEICESTER, DEPT SOCIOL, LEICESTER, LEICS, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LONDON, INST EDUC, LONDON KNOWLEDGE LAB, LONDON WC1N 1AZ, ENGLAND.","WHITE, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LEICESTER, DEPT SOCIOL, LEICESTER, LEICS, ENGLAND.","ALDRIDGE F, 2002; CHAKRABORTY J, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.0033-0124.2005.00486.x; COHEN J, 1994, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.50.12.1103; COHEN J, 2003; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DUTTON W, 2009; EPSTEIN D, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.548695; FUCHS C, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; GIGERENZER G, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2004.09.033; GORARD S, 2002; GRAHAM R, 2010, DOI 10.1080/13691180903514344; GREEN B, 2009; HALFORD S, 2010, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.499956; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HINDS D, 2011; JACKSON L, 2001, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00162.x; JEFFREYS H, 1998; KALAPESI C, 2010; LACY M, 1997, DOI 10.2307/1389496; LEAKER D, 2009, DOI 10.1057/elmr.2009.27; LINDLEY D, 1957; MANSKI C, 1995; MEYEN M, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0163443710374792; MIETTINEN O, 1982; MOSSBERGER K, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1078087405283511; MURDOCK G, 2011; NORRIS P, 2001; PEW INT AM LIF P, 2003; PRENTICE R, 1979, DOI 10.1093/biomet/66.3.403; REISDORF B, 2011, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.543141; SELWYN N, 2002, DOI 10.1017/s0047279402006487; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03054980802518920; SHEIKH K, 1981, DOI 10.1136/jech.35.4.293; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VERDEGEM P, 2011; WARSCHAUER M, 2002; WHITE P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01411926.2010.529871",42,2013,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000312593000001,ISI,UNIV LEICESTER;UNIV LONDON,UNIV LEICESTER,NA,"WHITE P, 2013, INFO COMMUN SOC","WHITE P, 2013, INFO COMMUN SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/1369118x.2011.611816,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN VARIABLES TO BE CORRELATED FOR PRACTICAL USE PROBABILITY AS A GUIDE FOR THEIR EFFECTIVENESS FOR E-LEARNING QUALITY ASSESSMENT. THE STUDY IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: INSTRUCTOR SUPPORT, STUDENT INTEREST, SELF-EVALUATIONS PERFORMED BY THE STUDENTS IN CONTENT KNOWLEDGE BEFORE AND AFTER THE TOPICS OF THE E-COURSE, AND A QUALITY EVALUATION OF THE E-LEARNING ENVIRONMENT AND MATERIALS. THE STUDY WAS BASED ON EVALUATING A GROUP OF FIVE HUNDRED LEARNERS. WE DESIGNED FOUR TYPES OF QUESTIONNAIRES AND ONE INTERVIEW TO ASSESS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE COURSE TOPICS THAT AFFECT THE PRACTICAL USES OF DIGITAL SKILLS. THE AUTHORS APPLIED KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT THEORY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. WE DEVELOPED A FORMULA FOR MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION EQUATIONS FOR PRACTICAL USES OF DIGITAL SKILLS PROBABILITY AND AS POTENTIAL PREDICTORS FOR EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF DIFFERENT TOPICS OF AN E-LEARNING COURSE.

DESPITE THE FACT THAT RURAL E-GOVERNANCE CAN BE MORE CITIZEN-CENTERED THAN NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, PROVIDE SERVICES EFFECTIVELY, SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND ENCOURAGE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE CONSIDERED SOCIAL HOMOGENEOUS SPACES, WITH A RELATIVELY PASSIVE OR CONSERVATIVE POPULATION, AND THEREFORE, HAVING LITTLE OF POSITIVE VALUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH A TRANSFORMATION AS E-GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO BE. THE GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF E-GOVERNMENT IN ROMANIA'S RURAL AREAS BY EVALUATING FIVE COMPONENTS: SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA, USABILITY, CONTENT, SERVICES OFFERED, AND DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION. WE ANALYZED 198 WEBPAGES. FROM THE FIVE DIMENSIONS, ACTUALLY ONLY TWO WERE MEASURABLE (USABILITY AND CONTENT), THE REST BEING ALMOST NONEXISTENT.

EDUC.,ARTICLE,RURAL-URBAN DIGITAL DIVIDE; INTERNET INEQUALITY; PRIMARY SCHOOL; WEB USE; ONLINE BEHAVIOURS,SELF-EFFICACY; INTERNET; GENDER; EXPERIENCE,"OVER THE LAST DECADES, THE ISSUE OF DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS RECEIVED PARTICULAR ATTENTION FROM INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND RESEARCHERS IN WESTERN COUNTRIES. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR THIS GROWING INTEREST IS RELATED TO THE IMPLICATIONS THAT DIGITAL INEQUALITIES HAVE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND PARTICULARLY FOR EDUCATION. DESPITE THE RELEVANCE OF THE ISSUE, THERE ARE STILL FEW STUDIES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN CHINA AND EVEN LESS ON CHINESE K-12 SCHOOLS' STUDENTS. THIS PAPER AIMS AT EXPLORING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES AMONG CHINESE CHILDREN FROM AN EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE. FOUR SCHOOLS WERE SELECTED, INVOLVING 658 STUDENTS AGED 10-14. NINE HYPOTHESES ON INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS (DIMAGGIO & HARGITTAI, 2001) AND THEIR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES WERE TESTED. THE STUDY FOUND THAT: (1) STUDENTS' INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME IS BETTER THAN THAT AT SCHOOL; (2) COMPARED WITH PARENTS, TEACHERS HAVE MORE POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON STUDENTS' INTERNET BEHAVIOUR; (3) STUDENTS FROM RURAL OR MIGRANT SCHOOLS SCORE LOWER ON ALL THE INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS (DIGITAL ACCESS, AUTONOMY OF USE, SOCIAL SUPPORT, INTERNET USE AND SELF-EFFICACY) AND ARE THEREFORE MORE DISADVANTAGED IN INTERNET USAGE STATUS THAN THEIR URBAN PEERS; (4) THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT GENDER DIFFERENCES; (5) THE MORE EDUCATION PARENTS HAVE RECEIVED, THE BETTER THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE LISTED INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS; (6) THE DIMENSIONS OF THE INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS (TECHNICAL APPARATUS, AUTONOMY OF USE, AVAILABILITY OF SOCIAL SUPPORT, VARIATION OF USE) ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED TO STUDENTS' INTERNET SELF-EFFICACY: (7) THERE IS HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN STUDENTS' INTERNET SELF-EFFICACY AND THEIR EXPLORING BEHAVIOURS OF INTERNET USE AND THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH DATA FROM OECD COUNTRIES AND CONFIRM THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE REPRESENTS A BIG SOCIAL CHALLENGE, REVEALING THAT SCHOOLS STILL HAVE TO DEVELOP EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO BALANCE SOCIAL AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AMONG STUDENTS.

ON THE BASIS OF THE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SCHOLARS IN DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES, WE SELECT A SERIES OF SOCIOECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INDICATORS AND PROVIDE AN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE DIGITALIZATION PATTERNS IN A SET OF 51 LOW INCOME AND LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME COUNTRIES. BY MEANS OF CLUSTER ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES, WE IDENTIFY THREE EMERGING PATTERNS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND DERIVE A SERIES OF POLICY IMPLICATIONS, RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO REDUCE DIGITAL BACKWARDNESS. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH PATTERN OF DIGITALIZATION CAN BE ALSO USEFULLY EMPLOYED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER PAST INTERVENTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF COMPETITION POLICY, HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ADDRESSING COUNTRY-SPECIFIC ISSUES.","BOCCONI UNIV, MILAN, ITALY.;  VALUELAB, MILAN, ITALY.","CORROCHER, N (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), BOCCONI UNIV, MILAN, ITALY.","ABERNATHY W, 1978; ABRAMSON B, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00072-5; ATROSTIC B K, 2000; BALIAMOUNE-LUTZ M, 2003, DOI 10.1002/itdj.1590100303; CASELLI F, 2001; CHEN W, 2004; COLECCHIA A, 2000; CORROCHER N, 2002, DOI 10.1080/02683960210132061; COTTEN S, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.02.020; DASGUPTA S, 2001; DATTA S, 2004; DIJK JAN V, 2000; EAMON M, 2004; EUROPEAN C, 2000; FORMAN C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jue.2005.05.004; GANLEY D, 2005; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HOWARD P, 2001; IACOVOU C, 1995, DOI 10.2307/249629; JARVENPAA S, 1991, DOI 10.2307/249382; KAUFFMAN R, 2005; KAUFFMAN R J, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s10799-005-5882-3; KENNY C, 2001; KRAUT R, 1999, DOI 10.1287/isre.10.4.287; LEONARDBARTON D, 1988, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.34.10.1252; MANSELL R, 1998; MESENBOURG T, 2000; NTIA, 1995; O'NEIL D, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309485; POHJOLA M, 2003; RICE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5; RIGGINS F, 2005; SELHOFER H, 2002; UNCTAD, 2006; UNIVERSITY OF T, 1999; VENKATESH V, 2001, DOI 10.2307/3250959; WALLSTEN S, 2003; WITSA, 2000; WOLCOTT P, 2001",2,2013,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000419494400083,ISI,BOCCONI UNIV;VALUELAB,BOCCONI UNIV,NA,"CORROCHER N, 2013, NA","CORROCHER N, 2013, NA",ITALY;ITALY,10.4018/978-1-4666-1852-7.ch082,978-1-4666-1853-4; 978-1-4666-1852-7,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,2,IGI GLOBAL,NA,WOS

BASED ON A REVIEW OF RECENT RESEARCH AND THEORETICAL WORK, THE CHAPTER CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS WHY DIGITAL EXCLUSION REMAINS A COMPLEX AND ENTRENCHED SOCIAL PROBLEM, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED TO RECOGNISE THE MEDIATING ROLE OF ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, AND SOCIAL FORMS OF CAPITAL IN SHAPING INDIVIDUALS' ENGAGEMENTS WITH ICT. FROM THIS BASIS, THE CHAPTER PROPOSES A HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION BASED AROUND CONCEPTUAL 'STAGES' OF ICT USE. USING THIS FRAMEWORK, THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT POLICYMAKERS, TECHNOLOGISTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION SOCIETY STAKEHOLDERS FACE A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE TO MATCH THE SOCIAL AFFORDANCES OF ICTS WITH THE EVERYDAY NEEDS, INTERESTS, AND DESIRES OF INDIVIDUALS. IN THIS SENSE, DIGITAL EXCLUSION CONTINUES TO DEMAND A COMPLEX SET OF POLICY RESPONSES WHICH GO FAR BEYOND SIMPLY INCREASING LEVELS OF HARDWARE PROVISION AND SUPPORT, AND THEN ASSUMING ANY 'GAPS' TO HAVE BEEN 'BRIDGED.'

HOWEVER, THERE ARE GREAT DIFFERENCES IN CITIZENS' E-GOVERNMENT USAGE AND, THUS, THERE EXISTS A GAP BETWEEN ADOPTERS AND NON-ADOPTERS OF E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. MOST RELATED STUDIES EXPLORE E-GOVERNMENT ACCEPTANCE ON THE BASIS OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION, WHILE INVESTIGATION OF ONLINERS RARELY TAKES PLACE. HOWEVER, BEING ONLINE IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE FOR CONSUMING INTERNET-BASED E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. AGAINST THE BACKGROUND THAT THE NUMBER OF INTERNET USERS IS INCREASING STEADILY, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFY THE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE GENERAL INTERNET ADOPTION (DIGITAL DIVIDE) EFFECTS AND E-GOVERNMENT-SPECIFIC DIVIDE EFFECTS. IN THE STUDY, THEY DEVELOP A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK, WHERE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF E-GOVERNMENT ADOPTION (AMONG ALL PEOPLE) IS SPLIT INTO (1) THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EFFECT AND (2) THE E-GOVERNMENT DIVIDE EFFECT (AMONG INTERNET USERS). THE AUTHORS DERIVE THREE CORRESPONDING RESEARCH MODELS AND EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS: AGE, GENDER, INCOME, AND EDUCATION. THEY TEST THE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK USING COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY DATA (N = 1930). ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS JUSTIFIES THE SEPARATION OF THE E-GOVERNMENT DIVIDE EFFECT FROM THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF E-GOVERNMENT ADOPTION, BECAUSE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING E-GOVERNMENT USAGE AMONG THE ENTIRE POPULATION AND AMONG ONLINERS ARE PROVED TO BE DIFFERENT.

A SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED USING A SAMPLE OF 148 FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS AND QUALITATIVE DATA WAS COLLECTED BY MEANS OF 22 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS AND TWO FOCUS GROUPS. ELEMENTS OF DIGITAL LITERACY SUCH AS CONFIDENCE IN SHARING CONTENTS, PRIVACY AND PROTECTION, INFORMATION LITERACY SKILLS AND ETHICALITY/RESPONSIBILITY SURROUNDING THE ACCESS AND USE OF DIGITAL INFORMATION WERE ANALYZED FROM PARTICIPANTS' ONLINE ACTIVITIES. THE RESEARCH WAS TAKEN WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ONLINE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY STUDENTS WITHIN AN ACADEMIC CONTEXT. FROM THE DATA ANALYSIS IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS SOME VARIATION IN STUDENTS' ONLINE SKILLS AND THESE ARE NOT RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED.

HOWEVER, WHILE TECHNOLOGY BECOMES MORE AND MORE PERVASIVE, AN AGE-RELATED UNDERUTILISATION OF IT REMAINS OBSERVABLE. FOR INSTANCE, ELDERLY PEOPLE (65 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER) ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO USE THE INTERNET THAN THE AVERAGE POPULATION (SEE, FOR INSTANCE, EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2011). THIS AGE-RELATED DIGITAL DIVIDE PREVENTS MANY ELDERLY PEOPLE FROM USING IT TO ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH TOOLS, SUCH AS INTERNET-BASED SERVICE DELIVERY. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PHENOMENON, THE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (15) LITERATURE LACKS A COMPREHENSIVE CONSIDERATION AND EXPLANATION OF TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE IN GENERAL AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, INTERNET ADOPTION BY THE ELDERLY. THIS PAPER THUS STUDIES THE INTENTIONS OF THE ELDERLY WITH REGARD TO INTERNET USE AND IDENTIFIES IMPORTANT INFLUENCING FACTORS. FOUR ALTERNATIVE MODELS BASED ON TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE THEORY ARE TESTED IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY DATA. AS A RESULT, A MODEL THAT EXPLAINS AS MUCH AS 84% OF THE VARIANCE IN TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AMONG THE ELDERLY IS DEVELOPED.

IT INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF TWO DISTINCT APPROACHES BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDING ACCESS TO LOCAL SUPPORT AND SERVICES. AUG CITY ADVOCATED A BOTTOM-UP INFRASTRUCTURE-BASED MODEL WITH NON-STATE INVOLVEMENT AFTER THE TECHNOLOGY WAS EMBEDDED. CONVERSELY, MOBILE CITY USED A CENTRALLY PLANNED MODEL WHERE THE STATE ACTED AS SERVICE CUSTODIANS THROUGH TEAMS OF VISITING OFFICERS AND A MOBILE OFFICE. A CASE STUDY APPROACH WAS UTILIZED FOCUSING ON TWO URBAN AREA OF THE UK, THAT ADOPTED CONTRASTING INITIATIVES FOR IMPLEMENTING MOBILE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (MICT) TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND SERVICES. ACTIVITY THEORY WAS USED TO PROVIDE A THEORETICAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK. A RANGE OF PRE-EXISTING INFORMATION NEEDS AND BARRIERS WERE REVEALED, BUT IN SOME CASES THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF PRESENTED A BARRIER. ISSUES WITH LITERACY, TECHNOLOGY SKILLS AND IN SOME CASES THE SOCIOEMOTIONAL CONDITION OF SOME OF THE SOCIALLY EXCLUDED COMBINED WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERMINES THE DIRECT ACCESS MODEL FOR THIS SECTION OF THE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL POLICY AND PRACTICE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS EXISTING INFORMATION NEEDS AND BARRIERS (SUCH AS LITERACY AND IT LITERACY, AND SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL ISSUES), AHEAD OF NEW MICT INITIATIVES TO ENSURE THE FULLEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND BENEFIT FOR TARGETED COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS.","UNIV LEEDS, SCH BUSINESS, LEEDS LS2 9JT, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.;  ABERYSTWYTH UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT STUDIES, ABERYSTWYTH SY23 3AS, DYFED, WALES.","SIMON, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ABERYSTWYTH UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT STUDIES, ABERYSTWYTH SY23 3AS, DYFED, WALES.","ABDELAAL A, 2009; AKMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.12.001; ALLEN D, 2011, DOI 10.1002/asi.21441; BAILUR S, 2012; BEATTIE-SMITH S, 2013; BEDNY G, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2007.07.005; BLACKBURN C, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2005.00547.x; BODKER S, 1997, DOI 10.1207/s15327884mca0403_2; BURU C, 2006; CAB O, 2000; CABINET O, 2008; CAIDI N, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.lisr.2005.04.003; CASTELLS M, 2001; CEGARRA-NAVARRO J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2012.02.008; CORDELLA A, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2010.01.001; DUTCH M, 2001, DOI 10.1515/libr.2001.183; DUTTON W, 2005; ENGESTR/M Y, 1993, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511625510.004; ENGESTROM Y, 1987; ENGESTROM Y, 1999; ENGESTROM Y, 1999; ENGESTROM Y, 1999, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511812774.025; EUROPEAN C, 2000; FEDOTOVA O, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.protcy.2012.09.017; FISHER K, 2004, DOI 10.1002/asi.20019; FOUNTAIN J, 2001; GEBREMICHAEL M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.02.011; GODFREY M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.08.016; GOODWIN I, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13691180701307446; GOVUK, 2013; HARDEY M, 2009, DOI 10.1093/bjsw/bcp024; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARRIS K, 2007; HELSPER E, 2008; HORROCKS I, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180802109030; HOWCROFT D, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1468-005x.00107; HSIEH J, 2008; HUDSON H E, 2008; IBRAHIM N, 2012, DOI 10.1002/asi.22676; KAPTELININ V, 1999, DOI 10.1145/306412.306431; KUUTI K, 1996; KUUTTI K, 1996; KVASNY L, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600630740; KVASNY L, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x; KVASNY L, 2002; KVASNY L, 2005; LATOUR B, 1993; LEONTEV A N, 1981; LEVITAS R, 2005, DOI 10.1057/9780230511552; LEVITAS R, 2004; LEVITAS R, 1996, DOI 10.1177/026101839601604601; LEVITAS R, 2007; LOADER B D, 2008; MALDONADO E, 2006; MBARIKA V, 2007, DOI 10.1080/01972240601057213; MERVYN K, 2012, DOI 10.1002/asi.22626; MISURACA G, 2009, DOI 10.1080/09537320902750871; MOONEY G, 2011; MORGAN G, 2009; PHIPPS L, 2000, DOI 10.1080/136911800359419; PLEACE N, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13691180701751171; POWELL A, 2011; PRAHALAD C, 2005; PROJECT N, 2005; PROJECT N, 2005; PUBLIC S, 2011; ROBILA M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.soscij.2005.12.009; RYDER G, 2007, DOI 10.1108/17506160710751959; SANDVIG C, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.006; SELWYN N, 2002, DOI 10.1017/s0047279402006487; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2002; SERVON L, 2001, DOI 10.1111/0735-2166.00089; SILVER H, 1994; SILVER H, 2007; SOCIAL EXCLUSION U, 2001; TAPIA A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2010.07.002; TAPIA A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0894439309335169; TOLBERT C, 2002; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN WINDEN W, 2001, DOI 10.1080/00343400120090275; VINCENT J, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180802025632; WARSCHAUER M, 2003; WILSON T, 2006; YOO Y, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2005.07.007; YOXALL N, 2012; YU L, 2010, DOI 10.1108/00220411011087869",33,2014,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000340289000003,ISI,UNIV LEEDS;ABERYSTWYTH UNIV,ABERYSTWYTH UNIV,NA,"MERVYN K, 2014, INFO COMMUN SOC","MERVYN K, 2014, INFO COMMUN SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/1369118x.2013.877952,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

NEW MEDIA,ARTICLE,SOUTH KOREA; DIGITAL SWITCHOVER; DIGITAL TELEVISION; DIGITAL DIVIDE,TELEVISION; CHALLENGES,"IN THIS ARTICLE, I DISCUSS THE LESSONS FROM SOUTH KOREA'S DIGITAL SWITCHOVER, CONSIDERING ITS DEVELOPMENT IN THE PROCESS AND THE REMAINING CHALLENGES. SOUTH KOREA COMPLETED THE DIGITAL SWITCHOVER ON DECEMBER 31, 2012, BUT THE ANALOGUE CABLE CONVERSION TO DIGITAL CABLE HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED FOR SOME TEN MILLION HOUSEHOLDS. FURTHERMORE, A MERE 2.6% OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS ELIGIBLE FOR GOVERNMENT SUPPORT BENEFITTED FROM THE SUPPORT SCHEME. ALTHOUGH KOREA EMBARKED ON ITS JOURNEY TOWARD DIGITAL TELEVISION RELATIVELY EARLY, ITS PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOW AND THE OUTCOME WAS ONLY A PARTIAL SUCCESS. I EXAMINE THE NATIONAL POLITICS LEADING UP TO PILOT PROGRAMS FOR ELIMINATING ANALOGUE TELEVISION SIGNALS IN TWO PHASES: WULJIN, KANGJIN, AND DANYANG DURING SEPTEMBER AND NOVEMBER 2010, FOLLOWED BY JEJU IN JUNE 2011. BASED ON THESE EXPERIENCES AND THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION AFTER THE SWITCHOVER, I CONCLUDE THAT SOUTH KOREA'S DIGITAL SWITCHOVER IS A PARTIAL SUCCESS AND THERE IS CONTINUED NEED FOR A CENTRALIZED HUB COLLABORATING BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT, THE BROADCASTERS, AND THE TELEVISION MANUFACTURERS TO COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND TO INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS TO OVERCOME THE REMAINING CHALLENGES.","UNIV E LONDON, SCH ARTS & DIGITAL IND, LONDON E16 2RD, ENGLAND.","YOON, H (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV E LONDON, SCH ARTS & DIGITAL IND, 4-6 UNIV WAY, LONDON E16 2RD, ENGLAND.","BROWN A, 2005; CAVE M, 2006; CHO S S, 2004; CHOI S W, 2010; COLAPINTO C, 2007; EVANS D, 2005; GALPERIN H, 2004; LEIVA M, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0163443709339465; GIVEN J, 2010, DOI 10.1386/jdtv.1.1.51/1; HALLIN D, 2004; IOSIFIDIS P, 2005; IOSIFIDIS P, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1748048506063764; IOSIFIDIS P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0267323110394562; JUNG I S, 2010; JUNG I, 2010, DOI 10.1386/jdtv.1.3.351_7; KANG S H, 2008; KIM D Y, 2010; KOREA BROADCASTING S, 2010; KOREA COMMUNICATIONS C, 2008; KOREA COMMUNICATIONS C, 2008; KOREA COMMUNICATIONS C, 2010; KUMABE N, 2012, DOI 10.1386/jdtv.3.3.349_7; LEE DONG H, 2008; LEE N P, 2010; MANSELL, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0011392102050003007; NAMGUNG H, 2010; OFCOM, 2006; RADIO PROMOTION A, 2008; SHIM D, 2008; SHIN D, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.11.004; SHIN J K, 2010; SHIN J K, 2010; STARKS M, 2007; STARKS M, 2010; SUNG K H, 2009; TRINIDAD GARCIA LEIVA M, 2006; YOON H S, 2013",3,2014,"COMMUNICATION; FILM, RADIO & TELEVISION",WOS:000340549800003,ISI,UNIV E LONDON,UNIV E LONDON,NA,"YOON H, 2014, TELEV NEW MEDIA","YOON H, 2014, TELEV NEW MEDIA",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/1527476413487817,NA,"COMMUNICATION; FILM, RADIO, TELEVISION",3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,NA,WOS

THIS STUDY IS CONCERNED WITH THE UNREPORTED CASE OF CYPRUS - THE LAST DIVIDED COUNTRY IN EUROPE, WITH MOST GREEK CYPRIOTS LIVING IN THE SOUTH AND MOST TURKISH CYPRIOTS LIVING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE ISLAND. THE STUDY EXPLORES TWO MAIN QUESTIONS: FIRST, ARE ONLINE EXPERIENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN CYPRUS SHAPED BY SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, SUCH AS GENDER, EDUCATION, AND INCOME?

ANALYSIS OF DATA OBTAINED BY A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE SURVEY OF ABOUT 350 YOUNG ADULT CYPRIOTS AGED 18-24 IN BOTH COMMUNITIES SUGGESTS THE EXISTENCE OF A 'REVERSE DIGITAL DIVIDE', AS THE MORE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY ENGAGES MORE OFTEN IN EXPRESSION, ASSOCIATION, AND LEARNING ONLINE.

ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO UNDER STAND THE SOCIAL SUPPORT PERCEIVED BY THESE WOMEN WITHIN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS AND ITS RELATION TO DIGITAL INCLUSION, CONSIDERING ALSO WHETHER THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE OF SUPPORT DEPENDING ON AGE, FAMILY STATUS AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS. TO DO THIS, WE APPLIED TWO SCALES MEASURING PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT AND DIGITAL INCLUSION TO 478 WOMEN FROM RURAL AREAS OF ANDALUSIA AGED 18 TO 65. THE RESULTS SHOWED A MEDIUM LEVEL OF SUPPORT, WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOUND IN THE SOCIAL SUPPORT PERCEIVED BY WOMEN DEPENDING ON THEIR AGE, FAMILY STATUS AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS. WOMEN, WHO WERE YOUNG, STUDENTS, SINGLE, WITH NO CHILDREN AND WHO USE TUENTI AND FACEBOOK PERCEIVED A HIGHER LEVEL OF SOCIAL SUPPORT IN SOCIAL NETWORKS. WE ALSO OBSERVED A STRONG RELATION BETWEEN PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT AND THE DIGITAL INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN SOCIAL NETWORKS, WITH SIMILARITIES APPEARING IN STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS AND SOCIAL GROUPS.

BY LOOKING AT THE SPANISH CASE, WE FIRST TESTED THE ADEQUATENESS OF THE ITEMS CHOSEN TO MEASURE THESE TWO DIMENSIONS.

SIMPLICITY IS AN IMPORTANT SELECTION CRITERION HERE, BECAUSE THE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONVEYED IN AN EFFICIENT MANNER (I.E., BRIEFLY AND CONCISELY), BUT ALSO BECAUSE STAKEHOLDERS (E.G., POLICY MAKERS, THE MEDIA, GENERAL PUBLIC) ARE HETEROGENEOUS IN THEIR METHODOLOGICAL BACKGROUNDS. THE CORRESPONDING WAYS OF MEASURING THUS NEED TO BE NOT ONLY EXHAUSTIVE AND MESSAGE-DELIVERING BUT ALSO SIMPLE AND INTUITIVELY UNDERSTANDABLE.

HOWEVER, BROADBAND TAKE-UP IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS STILL FAR FROM BEING SATISFACTORY, NOTABLY IN RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS WHERE SATELLITE SOLUTIONS ARE IDEALLY SUITED. TO ASSIST PUBLIC POLICIES CALLED ON SOLVING THIS SHORTAGE, EUTELSAT HAS TRIGGERED THE SABER (SATELLITE BROADBAND FOR EUROPEAN REGIONS) PROJECT, A CONSORTIUM OF SATELLITE OPERATORS, MANUFACTURERS AND 22 EU REGIONS, WITH THE EXTERNAL SUPPORT OF EC, THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA), THE EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK (EIB), EURISY AND THE NETWORK OF EUROPEAN REGIONS USING SPACE TECHNOLOGIES (NEREUS). THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF SABER ARE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF SATELLITE BROADBAND AND TO PROVIDE BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES FOR PUBLIC PROCUREMENT FOR EU INSTITUTIONS AND REGIONAL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES (PAS). TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTY POSED BY A SCATTERED BASE OF UNSERVED USERS IN A FRAGMENTED EUROPEAN MARKET, SABER PROPOSES THE ADOPTION OF SIMPLE, EFFICIENT AND COST-EFFECTIVE VOUCHER SCHEMES, WHICH SUPPORT USERS' DEMAND IN AREAS WHERE THE ONE-OFF COSTS NECESSARY TO ACCESS BROADBAND SERVICES ARE A GENUINE BARRIER TO TAKE-UP. OPEN TO COMPETITION AND CONSISTENT WITH EU RULES FOR PUBLIC GRANTS, VOUCHER SCHEMES SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF PURCHASING AND INSTALLING USER GROUND EQUIPMENT ALSO OVERCOME THE COMPLEXITY THAT ARISES FROM THE REGIONAL MANAGEMENT OF EU FUNDS, PROVIDED THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED AT LOCAL LEVEL ON THE BASIS OF A COMMON APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY DESIGNED AT EU OR NATIONAL LEVEL.","EUTELSAT, DEPT INT & INST AFFAIRS, PARIS, FRANCE.","AGNELLI, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), EUTELSAT, DEPT INT & INST AFFAIRS, PARIS, FRANCE.","ESOA, 2013; SABER, 2014; SABER, 2013; SABER, 2013; SABER, 2013; SABER, 2014",2,2014,ENGINEERING; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000363906800045,ISI,DEPT INT AND INST AFFAIRS,DEPT INT AND INST AFFAIRS,NA,"AGNELLI S, 2014, NA","AGNELLI S, 2014, NA",FRANCE,978-1-4799-5893-1,978-1-4799-5893-1,"ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC; TELECOMMUNICATIONS",2,IEEE,NA,WOS

TO THIS END, THE EU TRANSFERS STRUCTURAL FUNDS FOR BROADBAND EXPANSION TO REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS RATHER THAN TO THE NATIONAL LEVEL WHICH IS TYPICALLY SEEN AS THE DECISIVE ACTOR IN BROADBAND EXPANSION. TO EXPLORE THE RELEVANCE OF THE REGIONS IN WIDENING BROADBAND ACCESS, WE ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF ECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ON BROADBAND EXPANSION AT THE REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL. IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BOTH LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, WE EMPLOY A MULTI-LEVEL REGRESSION MODEL. WE FIND THAT REGIONAL LEVEL VARIABLES ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN PART OF BROADBAND ACCESS IMPROVEMENT. SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES ARE ERDF EXPENDITURE DEDICATED TO BROADBAND EXPANSION, THE STATUS OF REGIONAL BROADBAND DIFFUSION IN 2008 AND THE NATIONAL DEGREE OF INTER-PLATFORM COMPETITION.

IN THIS PAPER WE RE-EXAMINED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A CITIZEN HAVING HIGHER DIGITAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LITERACY WOULD MORE FREQUENTLY AND WITH A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE USE E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. WE ANALYSED THE COLLECTED APPLICATIONS RECEIVED TO A TENDER CONDUCTED BY A PUBLIC HOUSING INSTITUTION FOR RENTING FLATS UNDER FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS TO CITIZENS. THE CONCERNED CITIZENS WERE INTENTIONALLY OFFERED TWO POSSIBILITIES FOR SUBMITTING THEIR APPLICATIONS: IN PAPER FORM BY THE ORDINARY MAIL OR IN ELECTRONIC FORM VIA THE INTERNET. THE ELECTRONIC WEB FORM WAS DESIGNED TO BE SIMPLE AND EASY TO ACCESS, USE AND NAVIGATE; SUBMITTING AND COMPLETING THE APPLICATION FOR RENTING FLATS THROUGH THE WEB WAS OF THE SAME, IF NOT OF THE LESSER, COMPLEXITY THAN FILLING AND SENDING THE SAME APPLICATION BY THE ORDINARY MAIL. CONTRARY TO A POPULAR BELIEF THAT THE ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION WOULD BE TYPICALLY PREFERRED BY MORE DIGITALLY AND ADMINISTRATIVE LITERATE CITIZENS, THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY INDICATE THAT THE COMPLETENESS OF SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS BY THE ORDINARY MAIL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE COMPLETENESS OF THE APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED VIA THE WEB FORM.

THE PURPOSE OF THE MEASURING WAS TO ASSESS AND COMPARE IS PRACTICES AROUND THE GLOBE AS WELL AS SHARE BEST PRACTICES. A NUMBER OF MEASUREMENT TOOLS HAVE SINCE BEEN DEVELOPED, AND A NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED TOOLS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO FULFIL THIS GOAL. EVEN THOUGH MANY VARIATIONS IN TERMS OF INDICATORS HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED, THE CONSTRUCTION OF MEASUREMENT TOOLS IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. ONE LIMITATION IS THAT THEY DO NOT INCORPORATE THESE INDICATORS ON THE ACTUAL LEVELS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) USAGE OFF THE COUNTRY'S STAKEHOLDERS. THIS PAPER ANALYSES THE MOST CURRENTLY USED INDICES FOR MEASURING THE STATE OF INFORMATION SOCIETY BUILDING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THEIR CONSTITUENT INDICATORS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS, AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR IS MEASUREMENT, ADDRESSING THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF ICT USAGE QUALITY, IS DEVELOPED BASED ON DATA FROM THE EU MEMBER STATES. BY APPLYING THE FRAMEWORK ON MEASURING OF ICT USAGE QUALITY AT ROMANIA, CYPRUS AND ESTONIA, THE USEFULNESS IS TESTED POSITIVE, AND THE NEED TO EVALUATE THE ACTUAL LEVELS OF ICT USAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF BETTER POLICY-MAKING, WHILE ESTABLISHING AN INFORMATION SOCIETY, IS ACCENTUATED.

INDEED THE ADOPTION OF ICT HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS FOR WORLDWIDE ECONOMY GROWTH AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.

ONE OF THE MAIN OBSTACLES FOR THE FURTHER PENETRATION OF E-LEARNING IS THE EXISTENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ACROSS NATIONS OR / AND COMMUNITIES. DIGITAL DIVIDE IS DEFINED AS THE DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ICT'S ADOPTION BETWEEN NATIONS OR / AND COMMUNITIES. IN THIS PAPER THE HISTORIC EVOLUTION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS ANALYZED, IN ORDER ON ONE HAND TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RELEVANT POLICIES IN RELATION TO DIGITAL DIVIDE ELIMINATION AND ON THE OTHER HAND TO EXAMINE WHETHER EUROPEAN CITIZENS HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITIES IN RELATION TO E-LEARNING. TO DO SO, INDICATIVE QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS HAVE BEEN SELECTED, RELATED TO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES PENETRATION AND MORE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE EXISTENCE OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PENETRATION OF BROADBAND SERVICES. THE ANALYSIS OF THE SELECTED INDICATORS REVEALS THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED IN RELATION TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ACROSS EU COUNTRIES, DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE RESULTS OF ANALYSIS SHOW THAT IN SOME CASES, LIKE IN THE CASE OF THE EXISTENCE OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN RURAL AREAS, A CLEAR IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED. ON THE OTHER HAND THE ANALYSIS OF OTHER INDICATORS, LIKE THE FIXED AND MOBILE BROADBAND PENETRATION, INDICATES THAT DESPITE THE ADOPTED RELEVANT POLICIES, SLIGHT OR NO IMPROVEMENT IN RELATION TO THE ELIMINATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ACROSS EU 27 HAS BEEN MADE.","TEI IONIAN ISL, DEPT DIGITAL MEDIA & COMMUN, ARGOSTOLI KEFALONIA, GREECE.","POLYKALAS, SE (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TEI IONIAN ISL, DEPT DIGITAL MEDIA & COMMUN, ARGOSTOLI KEFALONIA, GREECE.","AL-MUTAWKKIL A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2008.12.008; ALLEMAN J, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00055-6; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; KEENGWE J, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s10956-008-9126-2; KLDIASHVILI E, 2012, DOI 10.4018/jitr.2012010102; MC CALLUM L, 2013, DOI 10.1093/jeclap/lpt022; OECD, 2005; PRIEGER J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.11.003; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; SCHLEIFE K, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003; SIPIOR J, 2005; SRINUAN C, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2011.10.003; UNCTAD, 2008",3,2014,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000381566500007,ISI,NA,SE (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"POLYKALAS SE, 2014, NA","POLYKALAS SE, 2014, NA-a",GREECE,978-1-4799-5739-2,978-1-4799-5739-2,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS",3,IEEE,NA,WOS

AN ALARMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXHIBIT DANGEROUSLY INTENSIVE MEDIA CONSUMPTION, WHILE INTERNET AND MOBILE PHONE ADDICTIONS ARE A WIDESPREAD PHENOMENON. AT THE SAME TIME, NEW MEDIA OVEREXPOSURE AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IS UNDERSTUDIED, EVEN MORE SO WHEN SOCIAL NETWORK SITES ARE CONCERNED. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS STUDY EXPLORES HOW FEELINGS OF OVEREXPOSURE AND STRESS RELATE TO THE SELF-EXPRESSIVE NEEDS OF TEENAGERS. IT PRESENTS AND DISCUSSES THE RESULTS OF A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY CONDUCTED DURING AN EXHIBITION ON MEDIA OVERLOAD IN SWITZERLAND. A TOTAL OF 6,989 ADOLESCENTS PROVIDED ANSWERS ON THEIR MEDIA OVERLOAD AND STRESS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION WERE USED TO QUANTIFY THE INFLUENCE OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS ON SOCIAL NETWORK SITE RELATED STRESS. FINDINGS - WHILE ONLY A MINORITY OF 13 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS FEELS STRESSED BY SOCIAL NETWORK SITES, MORE THAN ONE THIRD HAS THE FEELING OF SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME ON SUCH PLATFORMS. AGE, GENDER, AND LANGUAGE BACKGROUND (FRENCH VS. GERMAN SPEAKING) SHAPE THE OVERLOAD PROPENSITY, WITH OLDER, MALE AND FRENCH-SPEAKING TEENAGERS MOST AT RISK FOR SOCIAL NETWORK SITE STRESS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY PROPOSES THAT SOCIAL DIVIDES EXIST IN TEENAGERS' ABILITY TO COPE WITH A SPECIFIC AFFORDANCE OF SOCIAL NETWORK SITES, NAMELY THEIR CONSTANT STATUS UPDATES AND POTENTIAL OF OVEREXPOSURE. FURTHERMORE, IT REFLECTS UPON THE RELATION BETWEEN IDENTITY PERFORMANCE AND STRESS. ORIGINALITY OF CHAPTER - THE CHAPTER IS ONE OF THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE SOCIAL NETWORK SITE OVERLOAD WITH A BROAD SAMPLE APPROACH, QUANTIFYING ANTECEDENTS OF THE PHENOMENON.","UNIV ST GALLEN, INST MEDIA & COMMUN MANAGEMENT, ST GALLEN, SWITZERLAND.","LUTZ, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ST GALLEN, INST MEDIA & COMMUN MANAGEMENT, ST GALLEN, SWITZERLAND.","BAILEY J, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0196859912473777; BECHAR-ISRAELI H, 1994; BLINKA L, 2009, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2009.0044; BOYD D, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x; BRUGGEMANN B, 2009; BUCHER E, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.710245; BUFFARDI L, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0146167208320061; CARPENTER C, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2011.11.011; CHOATE L, 2009, DOI 10.5330/psc.n.2010-12.213; CHOU H, 2012, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2011.0324; CHRISTOFIDES E, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1948550611408619; CORREA T, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01532.x; DIMICCO J, 2007; DUCHENEAUT N, 2009; ELLISON N, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1461444811410395; EPPLER M, 2004, DOI 10.1080/01972240490507974; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00396.x; HARGITTAI E, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2012.669450; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; JUNCO R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.026; KOROLEVA K, 2010; KRASNOVA H, 2013; LENHART A, 2001; LI N, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2005.01.007; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808089415; LYNDON A, 2011, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2010.0588; MAIER C, 2012; MAIER C, 2012; MANAGO A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.001; MCANDREW F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2012.07.007; MCKENNA K, 1998, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.75.3.681; MCLEAN K, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.12.005; MEHDIZADEH S, 2010, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2009.0257; ONO H, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.t01-1-8401007; PALFREY J, 2008; PEMPEK T, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.appdev.2008.12.010; RAGU-NATHAN T, 2008, DOI 10.1287/isre.1070.0165; RINGROSE J, 2011, DOI 10.1386/macp.7.2.121_1; SELWYN N, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.003; SIBONA C, 2013, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2013.229; SMAHEL D, 2007, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2006.9945; SMITH P, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01846.x; STEENBERGEN M, 2010, DOI 10.1002/j.1662-6370.2010.tb00435.x; STERN S, 2002, DOI 10.1080/07491409.2002.10162447; STERN S, 2004, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4802_4; SUBRAHMANYAM K, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0012-1649.42.3.395; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WEISER E, 2000, DOI 10.1089/109493100316012; WOLFENDALE J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10676-006-9125-z; ZHAO S, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.012; ZILLIEN N, 2006",12,2014,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000376656200002,ISI,UNIV ST GALLEN,UNIV ST GALLEN,NA,"LUTZ C, 2014, NA","LUTZ C, 2014, NA",SWITZERLAND,10.1108/s2050-206020140000008001,978-1-78350-582-1; 978-1-78350-629-3,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,NA,WOS

THE PAPER SEEKS TO ACT AS AN EMPIRICAL REFERENCE POINT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FURTHER DEBATE AROUND THE LINKS BETWEEN CLASS AND DIGITAL MEDIA USE. THE PAPER PRESENTS A FACTOR ANALYSIS OF THE OFCOM DATA THAT IDENTIFIES FIVE MAIN AREAS OF DIGITAL MEDIA USE. THESE FIVE FACTORS ARE THEN SUBJECTED TO A MULTIPLE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS ACROSS, BETWEEN AND WITHIN AGE AND CLASS CATEGORIES. A CLUSTER ANALYSIS BASED ON THE FACTORS IDENTIFIES SEVEN MAIN 'USER TYPES' THAT ARE AGAIN COMPARED ACROSS CLASS AND AGE. THE PAPER FINDS THAT CLASS AND AGE ACT RELATIVELY INDEPENDENTLY AS PREDICATORS OF DIGITAL MEDIA USE AND NEITHER COMPOUND NOR MITIGATE EACH OTHER'S EFFECTS. IMPORTANTLY THE PAPER NOTES THAT THE GREATEST LEVELS AND BREADTH OF INTERNET USE CAN BE FOUND IN NRS SOCIAL CLASS GROUPS AB AND TO AN EXTENT C1. IN CONTRAST THE GREATEST LEVELS OF NON-USE AND LIMITED USE CAN BE FOUND IN NRS SOCIAL CLASS GROUPS DE. IN CONCLUSION THE PAPER NOTES THAT AGE STILL ACTS AS THE MAJOR EXPLANATORY VARIABLE FOR OVERALL USE AND SOME SPECIFIC TYPES OF USE, BUT THAT CLASS ALSO INDEPENDENTLY ACTS TO EXPLAIN PATTERNS OF DIGITAL MEDIA USE. AS A RESULT ANY SIMPLISTIC POLICY EXPECTATIONS THAT DIGITAL ACCESS AND USE ISSUES WILL BECOME LESS RELEVANT AS AGE DEMOGRAPHICS CHANGE HAVE TO BE QUESTIONED.","UNIV LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL L69 3BX, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.; SHEFFIELD HALLAM UNIV, SHEFFIELD S1 1WB, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.","YATES, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL L69 3BX, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.","AKCA H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.04.012; BAUERLEIN M, 2011; BIMBER B, 1999, DOI 10.1080/105846099198569; BOLT D, 2000; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOURDIEU P, 1986; BRADLEY H, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0038038514520855; CABINET O, 2013; CASTELLS M, 1997; COMPAINE B M, 2001; EASTIN M, 2000; ERIKSON R, 1992; FAITH B, 2015; FAITH B, 2014; FISCHER C, 1992; FUCHS C, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; FUCHS C, 2014; GORAYA H, 2012; GRAHAM R, 2010, DOI 10.5153/sro.1804; GREEN F, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0027950107083051; GRINT K, 1997; HALE T, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0002764210361685; HARGITTAI E, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6; HELSPER E, 2011; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2012.0257; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HOGGART, 1957; JACKSON L, 2001, DOI 10.1023/a:1010937901821; LAROSE R, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.004; LIEBERMANN Y, 2002, DOI 10.1108/13522750210443245; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MILLS C, 2015, DOI 10.1111/1467-954x.12287; MILLS C, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0038038513519880; PARTRIDGE H, 2012; POLICY E, 2013; RAGNEDDA M, 2013; ROBINSON L, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813481197; ROBINSON L, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.770049; ROBINSON L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2011.562224; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROSE D, 2003; ROSE D, 2005; SAVAGE M, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0038038514536635; SAVAGE M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0038038513481128; SONG I, 2004, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2004.7.384; THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE U, 2013; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 1999; WAREHAM J, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2003.11.005; WARSCHAUER M, 2003; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; WHITE P, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2011.611816; WITTE J, 2010; YATES S, 2015; YATES S, 2014",21,2015,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000369747400013,ISI,UNIV LIVERPOOL;SHEFFIELD HALLAM UNIV,UNIV LIVERPOOL,NA,"YATES S, 2015, SOCIOL RES ONLINE","YATES S, 2015, SOCIOL RES ONLINE",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.5153/sro.3751,NA,SOCIOLOGY,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,ESRC; SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL; ESRC [ES/J020869/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [ES/J020869/1] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH,WOS

WE DRAW UPON INTERNATIONAL INDICATORS, SECONDARY STATISTICAL SOURCES, AND PRIMARY SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THROUGH THIS ANALYSIS, WE ILLUSTRATE HOW FORMS OF STRATIFICATION INTERVENE WHEN TRYING TO INTEGRATE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED PRACTICES INTO THE CLASSROOM. WE CONSIDER STRATIFICATION IN TERMS OF THE TRADITIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE OF ACCESS AS WELL AS STRATIFICATION ALONG LINES OF STATUS, POLITICS, AND MOTIVATIONS. WE INTERPRET EDUCATORS' RELUCTANCE TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGY AS A REACTION TO THE TECHNOLOGY'S CAPACITY TO CHALLENGE THE EDUCATORS' LEGITIMACY, EXPERTISE, AND PREFERRED TEACHING MATERIALS.

THEREFORE, DIGITAL DIVIDE POLICIES SHOULD ADDRESS MATERIAL, SKILLS, AND USAGE ACCESS SIMULTANEOUSLY.","UNIV TWENTE, DEPT MEDIA COMMUN & ORG, NL-7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","VAN DEURSEN, AJAM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TWENTE, DEPT MEDIA COMMUN & ORG, CUBICUS BLDG,POB 217, NL-7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BAKER C, 1992; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BESSIERE K, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.015; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BYRNE BARBARA M, 2013; CHEN W, 2004; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; CHO J, 2003; COOPER J, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00185.x; COTTEN S, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0894439306286852; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DURNDELL A, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00006-7; EASTIN M, 2000; EPSTEIN D, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.548695; EYNON R, 2009, DOI 10.1080/17439880903345874; FERRO E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007; FRIJDA N, 1988, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.43.5.349; GIL-GARCIA J, 2006; GOLDFARB A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HAIR J, 2006; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323113499113; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; HOFFMAN D L, 2000; HOLLANDER B, 1996, DOI 10.1177/107769909607300110; HOWARD P, 2001; JACKSON L, 2001, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00162.x; JACKSON L, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0157; KATZ J, 2002; LESTER F, 1989, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4612-3614-6_6; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MARQUIE J, 2002, DOI 10.1080/0144929021000020998; MERAZ S, 2008; MERRITT K, 2005; MEUTER M, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0148-2963(01)00276-4; MOSSBERGER K, 2008; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; MOSSBERGER K, 2012; NEWHAGEN J E, 1998; NEWHAGEN J, 2005; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PAPACHARISSI Z, 2000, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4402_2; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; RICE R E, 2005; RICE R E, 2001; ROBINSON J, 2003; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROCKWELL S, 2002; ROJAS V, 2004; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.003; TALJA S, 2005, DOI 10.1002/asi.20091; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2012, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2012.670086; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2010.496338; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.001; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2009.06.005; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42; WARSCHAUER M, 2004; WASSERMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00301.x; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; WHITLEY B, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(96)00026-x; WILLIAMS M D, 2009; WITTE J C, 2009; XIE W, 2012; ZICKHUR K, 2012; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",139,2015,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000361133500002,ISI,UNIV TWENTE,UNIV TWENTE,NA,"VAN DEURSEN AJAM, 2015, INF SOC","VAN DEURSEN AJAM, 2015, INF SOC",NETHERLANDS,10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,143,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,WOS

COMMUN. SOC.,ARTICLE,ONLINE LEARNING; DIGITAL DIVIDE; FACE-TO-FACE; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; LEARNER MOTIVATION; MOOCS,CLASSROOM,"MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS) OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF ENTIRELY VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, WITH LECTURES, DISCUSSIONS, AND ASSIGNMENTS ALL DISTRIBUTED VIA THE INTERNET. THE VIRTUAL NATURE OF MOOCS PRESENTS CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGES TO STUDENTS IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY TO LEARN WHAT THEY WANT, WHEN THEY WANT. YET DESPITE THEIR VIRTUAL FOCUS, SOME MOOC USERS ALSO SEEK TO CREATE FACE-TO-FACE COMMUNITIES WITH STUDENTS TAKING SIMILAR COURSES OR USING SIMILAR PLATFORMS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO ASSESS THE LEARNER MOTIVATIONS BEHIND CREATION OF THESE OFFLINE COMMUNITIES. DO THESE FACE-TO-FACE MEETINGS REPRESENT AN ADDED EXTRA TO THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE, WITH STUDENTS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CONTEXT OF THE MOOCS TO CREATE NEW PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS? OR, ARE OFFLINE MEETUPS FILLING A GAP FOR STUDENTS WHO FEEL THAT NOT ALL LEARNING CAN TAKE PLACE ONLINE? WE ALSO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PATTERNS VARY BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND INDUSTRIALISED REGIONS, THUS TESTING THE CLAIM THAT MOOCS ARE HELPING TO DEMOCRATISE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AROUND THE WORLD. OUR RESEARCH IS BASED ON A UNIQUE SOURCE OF SOCIALLY GENERATED BIG DATA, DRAWN FROM THE WEBSITE 'MEETUP.COM', WHICH GIVES US A DATA SET OF OVER 4000 MOOC RELATED EVENTS TAKING PLACE IN OVER 140 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD. WE APPLY A MIXED METHODS APPROACH TO THIS DATA, COMBINING LARGE-SCALE ANALYSIS WITH MORE IN-DEPTH THEMATIC HAND CODING, TO MORE FULLY EXPLORE THE REASONS WHY SOME LEARNERS ADD A 'REAL' COMPONENT TO THEIR VIRTUAL LEARNING EXPERIENCE.","HARVARD UNIV, BERKMAN CTR INTERNET & SOC, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.;  UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, OXFORD, ENGLAND.","BULGER, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), HARVARD UNIV, BERKMAN CTR INTERNET & SOC, 23 EVERETT ST,2ND FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.","ALARIO-HOYOS C, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-40814-4_2; ALGESHEIMER R, 2005, DOI 10.1509/jmkg.69.3.19.66363; ALLEN I E, 2013; ALTMAN D, 1991; AMES C, 1988, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.80.3.260; BALFOUR STEPHEN P, 2013; BELANGER Y, 2013; BRUFF D O, 2013; CHEN P, 2014; EDMONDSON A, 1999, DOI 10.2307/2666999; FINN J, 1993; FLEISS J L, 1981; FRANK M, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(02)00095-7; GILLANI N, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2014.05.004; HODSON H, 2013, DOI 10.1016/s0262-4079(13)62730-x; HOWELL D, 2001, DOI 10.1080/87567550109595855; JORDAN K, 2014, DOI 10.19173/irrodl.v15i1.1651; JUVONEN J, 2006, DOI 10.4324/9780203874790.ch28; KANWAR A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/08923641003696588; KELLOGG S, 2013; KIZILCEC R, 2013, DOI 10.1145/2460296.2460330; KLEMKE R, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01135_1_1.x; MAYER R, 2007; MEECE J, 1988, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.80.4.514; MILLIGAN C, 2014; MOHAPI T, 2014; POWELL S, 2013; RAFFAGHELLI J E, 2014; SALAS E, 2006; TUCKER B, 2012, DOI 10.4236/oalib.1107398",25,2015,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000359529200005,ISI,HARVARD UNIV;UNIV OXFORD,HARVARD UNIV,NA,"BULGER M, 2015, INFO COMMUN SOC","BULGER M, 2015, INFO COMMUN SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;USA,10.1080/1369118x.2015.1061571,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

FIRST, WE DESCRIBE THE RE-USE OF COMPUTERS AS A FACTOR THAT CAN HELP BRIDGE THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN AN ICT4D CONTEXT, REFURBISHED COMPUTERS CAN BE USED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. WE DESCRIBE AND ILLUSTRATE THE OPERATING MODEL OF SUCH A COMPUTER RE-USE ORGANIZATION, HIGHLIGHTING THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS AND INTERACTIONS OF THE OPERATING MODEL. NEXT, WE DISCUSS HOW E-WASTE PUTS THIS COMPUTER RE-USE MODEL UNDER PRESSURE. WE ARGUE THAT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF COMPUTER RE-USE IN AN ICT4D CONTEXT IS SERIOUSLY IMPACTED BY THIS INCREASING E-WASTE PROBLEM. FINALLY, WE DESCRIBE HOW A COMPUTER RE-USE MODEL CAN BE EXTENDED AND COMPLEMENTED WITH E-WASTE HANDLING ACTIVITIES TO RETAIN POSITIVE EFFECTS IN AN ICT4D CONTEXT.

EDUCATION SYSTEMS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE GROWING EVIDENCE OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE. THROUGH THIS STUDY, WE LOOK TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE FACTORS RELATED TO THE DIGITAL SKILLS OF 10TH GRADE CHILEAN STUDENTS, AS MEASURED BY A NATIONAL STANDARDIZED TEST. A MIXED METHODOLOGY WAS USED TO EXPLORE THESE FACTORS AND PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING A HIERARCHICAL LINEAR MODEL TO DETERMINE WHICH FACTORS EXPLAIN STUDENT PERFORMANCE ON THE TEST. IN ADDITION TO THIS, A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS ALSO CARRIED OUT USING AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS CASE STUDY WAS TO TAKE A MORE IN-DEPTH LOOK AT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF HIGH AND LOW-PERFORMING STUDENTS ON THE DIGITAL SKILLS TEST. THIS WAS DONE BY ANALYZING THEIR ACTIVITIES, PERCEPTIONS AND MOTIVATIONS WHEN USING TECHNOLOGY. THE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DEVELOPING DIGITAL SKILLS ARE HAVING ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AT HOME, LINGUISTIC CAPITAL, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE USING A COMPUTER. THE QUALITATIVE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT STUDENTS WHO SCORED HIGHLY ON THE TEST WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE ON THEIR SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS WHEN USING THE INTERNET. THESE STUDENTS ALSO ADOPTED COGNITIVE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. OUR FINDINGS SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES THAT AIM TO DEVELOP STUDENTS' DIGITAL SKILLS. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

ALL INTERNET SKILLS ARE MEASURED AMONG REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF THE DUTCH POPULATION IN 2010, 2011, 2012, AND 2013. CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA ARE REPEATED TO CONSIDER PATTERNS OF CHANGE AT THE AGGREGATE LEVEL. THE LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL AND FORMAL INTERNET SKILLS INCREASED MOST. INFORMATION INTERNET SKILL REMAINED MORE OR LESS CONSISTENT, AND STRATEGIC INTERNET SKILLS ONLY REVEALED A VERY SMALL INCREASE. POLICIES RELATED TO INTERNET SKILLS ARE LARGELY AIMED AT IMPROVING BASIC SKILLS AMONG SPECIFIC TARGET GROUPS. FUTURE POLICIES SHOULD SHIFT TOWARDS IMPROVING INFORMATION AND STRATEGIC SKILLS, WHICH WILL BE A MORE DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. GENDER, AGE, AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND ARE ALL IMPORTANT VARIABLES RELATED TO SKILL INEQUALITIES. AS AGE INCREASES, INTERNET SKILL LEVELS DECREASE. INFORMATION INTERNET SKILLS ONLY INCREASED FOR PEOPLE AGED OVER 65 YEARS BETWEEN 2010 AND 2013.

THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE MAIN FINDINGS OF A SURVEY CARRIED OUT AS PART OF A LARGER NATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECT FOCUSED ON ACTIVE AGEING, WHICH INVOLVED 900 ITALIAN PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN 65 AND 74 YEARS OF AGE. THE RESEARCH INVESTIGATES SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUNG ELDERLY ITALIAN INTERNET USERS AND FACTORS RELATED TO THEIR USE OF ICTS. RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE IS A STRONG DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN YOUNG ELDERLY ITALIANS, WHICH IS PRIMARLY INFLUENCED - IN TERMS OF CLASSICAL DYNAMICS-BY DIFFERENCES IN ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CAPITAL. WITH REGARD TO THE THEME OF ACTIVE AGEING, IF IT IS TRUE THAT HIGHLY DIGITALIZED YOUNG ELDERS ARE GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY GOOD HEALTH, AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF THIS RESEARCH IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INDICATE WHETHER THE ADOPTION OF ICTS GUARANTEES SOCIAL INCLUSION AND PARTICIPATION.","UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE, DEPT COMMUN & PERFORMING ARTS, I-20123 MILAN, ITALY.;  UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE, SOCIOL CULTURE & COMMUN, I-20123 MILAN, ITALY.;  UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE, I-20123 MILAN, ITALY.","COLOMBO, F (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE, DEPT COMMUN & PERFORMING ARTS, I-20123 MILAN, ITALY.","AROLDI P, 2013; COLOMBO F, 2014, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-425-1-145; DICKINSON A, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.03.001; EUROPEAN C, 2011; HADDON L, 2000, DOI 10.1177/1461444800002004001; HARGITTAI E, 2002; LANZETTI C, 1995; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; LOOS E, 2011; NAUMANEN M, 2009; OLVE G, 2006; RIVA G, 2014; ROSSI G, 2014; SAUNDERS E, 2004, DOI 10.1080/03601270490466967; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SILVERSTONE R, 1992, DOI 10.4324/9780203401491_chapter_1; SMITH A, 2014; SOURBATI M, 2008; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WARSCHAUER M, 2002",28,2015,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000368534800005,ISI,UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE;UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE;UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE,UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE,NA,"COLOMBO F, 2015, COMUNICAR","COLOMBO F, 2015, COMUNICAR",ITALY;ITALY;ITALY,10.3916/c45-2015-05,NA,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,30,GRUPO COMUNICAR,UNIVERSITA CATTOLICA DEL SACRO CUORE (ITALIA),WOS

THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF EACH DISCUSSION INDICATE THAT THE INTERNET IS A SOURCE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ELDERLY, AND THIS POTENTIAL MAY BE DIVIDED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION, TRANSACTIONS AND ADMINISTRATION, TOGETHER WITH LEISURE AND ENTERTAINMENT. THIS POTENTIAL IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE ELDERLY AND CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR ACTIVE AGEING.

GOING BEYOND THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROMISE, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE AGREEMENT BETWEEN TEACHERS, SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, AND POLICY MAKERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF A COMMUNITY APPROACH THAT RECOGNISES THE VALUE OF COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION AS A SUCCESSFUL MEANS OF ADDRESSING THE EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES OF SCHOOLING.","UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","MENESES, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","AIKEN L S, 1991; BARON R, 1986, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1173; CARMICHAEL P, 2006, DOI 10.1080/09585170600787969; CASTELLS M, 2003; CHAMPOUX J, 1987, DOI 10.1111/j.2044-8325.1987.tb00257.x; COHEN D K, 1987, DOI 10.3102/01623737009002153; COHEN J, 2002, DOI 10.4324/9780203774441; CUBAN L, 1986; DARDENNE W, 2010; DEPARTMENT FOR E, 2013; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DUNCAN-HOWELL J, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00953.x; EURYDICE, 2011; FRAZIER P, 2004, DOI 10.1037/0022-0167.51.1.115; HARGITTAI E, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0894439305275911; HARGITTAI E, 2011; HEPP P, 2004; JACCARD J, 2003; LENHART A, 2003; LIEVROUW L, 2003, DOI 10.1002/aris.1440370112; LIN F, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2006.07.009; LIVINGSTONE S, 2012, DOI 10.1080/03054985.2011.577938; LORENZO-SEVA U, 2006, DOI 10.3758/bf03192753; MATZAT U, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0002764209356249; MENESES J, 2008, DOI 10.5565/rev/papers/v87n0.789; MENESES J, 2012, DOI 10.1080/09243453.2012.662156; MENESES J, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01972241003712231; MOMINO J, 2008; OECD, 2011, DOI 10.1787/9789264112995-en; OECD, 2004; PLOMP T, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-8928-2; PLOMP T, 2009; REISER R, 2001, DOI 10.1007/bf02504506; ROBINSON J, 2003; SAETTLER P, 1990; SCHEUERMANN F, 2009; SCHUCK S, 2003; SOPER D S, 2013; STEYAERT J, 2002; SUNTISUKWONGCHOP, 2006, DOI 10.1353/hsj.2006.0001>; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; TOMAI M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2009.08.009; TRUCANO M, 2005; TSAI I, 2010, DOI 10.2190/ec.43.2.e; TURCOTTE S, 2008; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2013, DOI 10.1057/9781137297792_8; VOOGT J, 2013, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00453.x; VOOGT J, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00375.x; WARSCHAUER M, 1995; WARSCHAUER M, 2003",0,2015,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000434553300010,ISI,UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA,UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA,NA,"MENESES J, 2015, EDUCAR","MENESES J, 2015, EDUCAR",SPAIN,10.5565/rev/educar.727,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,GENERALITAT DE CATALUNYA; JAUME BOFILL FOUNDATION,WOS

SOC.,ARTICLE,SOCIAL MEDIA AND DISASTERS; CRISIS COMMUNICATION; HUMANITARIANISM; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; SOCIAL INEQUALITY; MOBILE PHONES; SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES; MEDIA ENVIRONMENTS; POLYMEDIA; ETHNOGRAPHY,TWITTER; AGE,"THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES THE INTERSECTION OF DIGITAL AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY IN THE CONTEXT OF DISASTER RECOVERY. IN DOING SO, THE ARTICLE RESPONDS TO THE OPTIMISM PRESENT IN RECENT CLAIMS ABOUT ""HUMANITARIAN TECHNOLOGY"" WHICH REFERS TO THE EMPOWERING USES AND APPLICATIONS OF INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGIES BY DISASTER-AFFECTED PEOPLE. DRAWING ON A LONG-TERM ETHNOGRAPHY WITH AFFECTED COMMUNITIES RECOVERING FROM TYPHOON HAIYAN THAT HIT THE PHILIPPINES IN 2013 TRIGGERING A MASSIVE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE, THE ARTICLE OFFERS A GROUNDED ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA IN DISASTER RECOVERY. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE FOCUSES ON WHETHER ANY POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH DIGITAL MEDIA USE ARE EQUALLY SPREAD AMONG BETTER OFF AND SOCIALLY MARGINALIZED PARTICIPANTS. THE ANALYSIS REVEALS SHARP DIGITAL INEQUALITIES WHICH MAP ONTO EXISTING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. WHILE SOME OF OUR ALREADY BETTER-OFF PARTICIPANTS HAVE ACCESS TO A RICH MEDIA LANDSCAPE WHICH THEY ARE ABLE TO NAVIGATE OFTEN REAPING SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS, LOW-INCOME PARTICIPANTS ARE TRAPPED IN A DELAYED RECOVERY WITH DIMINISHED SOCIAL MEDIA OPPORTUNITIES. THE FACT THAT SOME PARTICIPANTS ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIA TO RECOVER AT A RAPID PACE WHILE OTHERS ARE LANGUISHING BEHIND REPRESENTS A DEEPENING OF SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. IN THIS SENSE, DIGITAL INEQUALITY CAN AMPLIFY SOCIAL INEQUALITIES LEADING TO A POTENTIAL ""SECOND-ORDER DISASTER."" THIS REFERS TO HUMANLY PERPETUATED DISASTERS THAT CAN EVEN SURPASS THE EFFECTS OF THE NATURAL DISASTER.","GOLDSMITHS UNIV LONDON, MEDIA & COMMUN, LONDON, ENGLAND.","MADIANOU, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), GOLDSMITHS UNIV LONDON, DEPT MEDIA & COMMUN, LONDON SE14 6NW, ENGLAND.","ADAMS, 2013; ADAMS V, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1548-1425.2009.01199.x; AGAMBEN G, 2005; BANKOFF G, 2003; BRUNS A, 2012; BUCKINGHAM D, 2007, DOI 10.2304/rcie.2007.2.1.43; COBB, 1972; COMPAINE B, 2001; CONSTABLE N, 2005; CRAWFORD K, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10708-014-9597-z; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; FASSIN D, 2005, DOI 10.1525/ae.2005.32.3.389; FOUNTAIN C, 2005, DOI 10.1353/sof.2005.0030; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2013; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2008; HARTMANN C, 2014; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HORST H, 2006; HUGHES A, 2009, DOI 10.1504/ijem.2009.031564; KLEIN N, 2007; KLINENBERG E, 2015; LIVINGSTONE S, 2004; MADIANOU M, 2012; MADIANOU M, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12069; MADIANOU M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1367877912452486; MADIANOU M, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-0374.2012.00352.x; MCKAY D, 2012; MEIER P, 2015; MURTHY D, 2013; MURTHY D, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.696123; NORRIS, 2000; NORRIS P, 2001; ONG A, 2006; PALEN L, 2010, DOI 10.1002/bult.2010.1720360505; PALEN L, 2008; PARRENAS R, 2001; PERTIERRA R, 2010; RAFAEL V, 1990, DOI 10.1017/s0010417500016492; RAINIE L, 2012; RUSSELL J, 2011; SCHRADIE J, 2012, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.665939; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SHAH D, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0093650205279209; SHELLER M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1474474012438828; SOMERS M, 2008; STARBIRD K, 2011; STARBIRD K, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10807039.2014.947866; THE E, 2012; TIERNEY K, 2007, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.33.040406.131743; WORLD B, 2012; WORLD DISASTERS R, 2013",23,2015,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000443451100004,ISI,GOLDSMITHS UNIV LONDON,GOLDSMITHS UNIV LONDON,NA,"MADIANOU M, 2015, SOC MED SOC","MADIANOU M, 2015, SOC MED SOC",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/2056305115603386,NA,COMMUNICATION,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (ESRC) [ES/M001288/1]; ESRC [ES/M001288/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [ES/M001288/1] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH,WOS

SOC.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL COMPETENCE; DIGITAL GAP; MEDIA LITERACY; MEDIA COMPETENCE; AUDIOVISUAL LANGUAGE; CITIZENSHIP,INFORMATION; LITERACY,"VIDEOGAMES, TELEVISIONS, AND COMPUTERS IN ALL THEIR FORMS, AND SMARTPHONES, ARE EVERYWHERE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TIME SPENT IN FRONT OF A SCREEN BY ALL SECTORS OF SOCIETY NOW TAKES UP MOST OF THE LEISURE TIME OF THE CITIZENS OF ALL FOUR CORNERS OF THE WORLD. YET IN THE FACE OF THIS BARRAGE OF MEDIA, CITIZENS HAVE DEVELOPED FEW FORMATIVE EXPERIENCES FOR ACQUIRING THESE AUDIOVISUAL AND MEDIA LANGUAGES OR FOR INCREASING THEIR AUDIOVISUAL AND MEDIA SKILLS. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS MEDIA COMPETENCE IN THE SPANISH REGION OF ANDALUSIA WITH THE USE OF AN INSTRUMENT SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR THE PURPOSE. THE MEASUREMENT CRITERIA AND INDICATORS OF THIS TOOL ARE SHAPED BY MEDIA LITERACY PARADIGMS AND LEADING INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE MODELS, IN PARTICULAR THE MODEL PROPOSED BY HOBBS. THE INSTRUMENT CONSISTS OF INDICATORS WHICH, ACCORDING TO THEIR FEATURES, ARE MEASURED VIA SUBJECTIVE OR OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS AND MULTIPLE CHOICE (ORDINAL OR NOMINAL) OPTIONS. MEASUREMENT IS STANDARDIZED BY THE INTERPRETATION OF THE RESPONSES TO THE ITEMS ON A SCALE OF 1- 4. THE CONSTRUCT IS VALIDATED BY MEANS OF FACTORIAL ANALYSIS TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF THE FIVE FACTORS (CRITERIA) THAT FORM THE INSTRUMENT.

COMMUNITIES OF PROPINQUITY NO LONGER SEEM TO BE AS DETERMINING OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AS THEY ONCE WERE. MOBILE CELL PHONE TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET HAVE REDEFINED WHAT IT MEANS TO 'KEEP IN TOUCH'. SOME AUTHORS HAVE ARGUED THAT THESE NEW FORMS OF CONNECTIVITY HAVE CREATED A 'DIGITAL DIVIDE' BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE BECOME ACTIVE ADOPTERS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. USING DATA FROM THE BRITISH GENERAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY (GHS), WE EXAMINED TRENDS IN MOBILE PHONE OWNERSHIP AMONGST PEOPLE OVER FIFTY DURING THE PERIOD 2000 - 2009. COMPARED WITH THE PACE OF CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF OTHER HOUSEHOLD TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, DISHWASHERS, FRIDGE FREEZERS AND MICROWAVE OVENS, THE TAKE UP OF MOBILE PHONES AMONGST THOSE AGED 50 AND OVER HAS FOLLOWED A MUCH SHARPER RISE. BASED UPON THESE FINDINGS, WE SUGGEST A MORE SCEPTICAL STANCE TOWARDS THE ICT 'GENERATIONAL DIVIDE' WHICH NEEDS MORE DETAILED INTERROGATION. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DIVIDE MAY BE A MORE SHORT LIVED PHENOMENON, AS SUCCESSIVE COHORTS OF PEOPLE AGED FIFTY AND OVER ARE BECOMING ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN INDIVIDUALISED NETWORKED COMMUNITIES.","UCL, LONDON, ENGLAND.; CARDIFF UNIV, CARDIFF CF10 3AX, S GLAM, WALES.","GILLEARD, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UCL, LONDON, ENGLAND.","ABRAMS P, 1970, DOI 10.1177/002200947000500112; ADAMS C, 2006; AGAR J, 2004; ARNING K, 2010; ARNING K, 2009; BAWDEN D, 2008; BECK U, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0263276403020002001; BORGMANN A, 1984; CASTELLS, 1998; CASTELLS M, 1996; CASTELLS M, 1997; CHARNESS N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01647.x; CHAU S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2006.04.005; CHEN K, 2013; CONCI M, 2009, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-03655-2_7; DICKERSON M, 1983, DOI 10.1086/208961; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DOCAMPO RAMA M, 2001, DOI 10.4017/gt.2001.01.01.003.00; DUTTON W, 2009; EDMUNDS J, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00083.x; FERNANDEZ-ARDEVOL M, 2010; FERNANDEZ-ARDEVOL M, 2010; GAO J, 2010; GAUL S, 2009; GELL N, 2013; GILLEARD C, 2005; GILLEARD C, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10433-008-0083-7; GILLEARD C, 2007, DOI 10.1093/geronb/62.4.s276; GRAHAM R, 2008; GRAHAM R, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809341436; GRONOW J, 2009; HASHIZUME A, 2009, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-02806-9_49; HEART T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.03.002; HIGGS P, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-954x.2008.01806.x; HIGGS P, 2010, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x10000425; JANSEN J, 2010; JONES I, 2008, DOI 10.1332/policypress/9781861348821.001.0001; KALBA K, 2008; KURNIAWAN S, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.03.002; MADDEN M, 2010; NEVES B, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.2998; NORRIS P, 2001; OKSMAN V, 2006, DOI 10.5334/2006-3; PEW RESEARCH C, 2014; PLAZA I, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2011.05.035; RAN W, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1461444806059870; RICE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5; RYAN J, 2010; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; SHREWSBURY CAROLYN M, 2002, DOI 10.1300/j031v14n03_11; SMITH A, 2010; SOURBATI M, 2009, DOI 10.1177/1461444809340786; TACKEN M, 2005, DOI 10.4017/gt.2005.03.03.002.00; TURNER B, 1989, DOI 10.2307/590890; TURNER P, 2010; WANG A, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s12126-010-9072-1; ZIEFLE M, 2005, DOI 10.1080/0144929042000320009",13,2015,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000369741400006,ISI,CARDIFF UNIV,C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"GILLEARD C, 2015, SOCIOL RES ONLINE","GILLEARD C, 2015, SOCIOL RES ONLINE",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.5153/sro.3552,NA,SOCIOLOGY,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,AHRC CONNECTED COMMUNITIES RESEARCH PROGRAMME [REF: AH/J501642/1]; ESRC [ES/L009099/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [ES/L009099/1] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH,WOS

THIS ARTICLE WANTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEBATE ABOUT ELDERS AND THEIR ABILITIES TO USE AND INTERESTS IN ICTS. WE ANALYSED HOW ELDERS IN FOCUS GROUPS IN SPAIN USE MOBILE ICT APPLICATIONS, HOW THEY EXPERIMENT WITH THEM AND WHY THEY DECIDE TO USE OR NOT TO USE THEM. IN OUR RESEARCH, WE HAVE USED APPS AS AN EXAMPLE FOR ICTS BECAUSE APPS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE FLAGSHIPS FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND BECAUSE, IN CONTRAST TO CALL AND MESSENGER FUNCTIONS OF MOBILE PHONES, THE MOTIVATION FOR USING APPS HAS TO COME FROM THE INDIVIDUAL THAT USES THEM. FINDINGS FROM 4 FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH ELDERS FROM SPAIN SUGGEST THAT AGE DOES NOT DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE PERCEPTION OF, EXPERIENCE WITH, AND EVALUATION OF NEWEST TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS. INSTEAD PAST EXPERIENCES AND SOCIAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY IS INTRODUCED PLAY A ROLE. OUR RESULTS POINT AT THE NEED TO FIND NEW FORMULAS FOR INTRODUCING, AND TEACHING ICTS TO ELDERS, AND UNDERLINE THE NEED TO TAKE ELDERS' EMOTIONS WITH REGARD TO ICTS INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN EVALUATING ELDERS' ICT USES.","UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU, SOCIAL SCI FAC, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;  UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU, CABLE STUDIES CTR CECABLE, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;  UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;  UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU, STUDIES CRIMINOL, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;  OPEN UNIV CATALONIA UOC, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","SEEBACH, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), OPEN UNIV CATALONIA UOC, RES CTR IN3, BARCELONA 08018, SPAIN.","BEN-ZE'EV A, 2001; BENAMATI J, 2007; BLOOR M, 2001, DOI 10.4135/9781849209175; BROADBENT R, 2013, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2011.572186; CASTELLS M, 2006; CROW B, 2010; CZAJA SARA J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10209-006-0060-x; FERNANDEZ-ARDEVOL M, 2012; FERNANDEZ-ARDEVOL M, 2012, DOI 10.1386/iscc.3.1.9_1; GIVEN L M, 2008, DOI 10.4135/9781412963909.n470; HOCHSCHILD A, 2012; KURNIAWAN S, 2007, DOI 10.1145/1273961.1273979; LING R, 2008, DOI 10.1080/01972240802356125; LOOS E, 2012, DOI 10.15847/obsobs612012513; MITZNER T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.020; NEVES B, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.2998; OKSMAN V, 2006; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; RICE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5; THRANE K, 2002",14,2015,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000418823500007,ISI,UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU;UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU;UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU;UNIV ABAT OLIBA CEU;OPEN UNIV CATALONIA UOC,OPEN UNIV CATALONIA UOC,NA,"GASCON JFF, 2015, MOB MEDIA COMMUN","GASCON JFF, 2015, MOB MEDIA COMMUN",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1177/2050157914560185,NA,COMMUNICATION,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,NA,WOS

WITH THIS GOAL IN MIND, WE CONDUCTED TWO SURVEYS: ONE WAS ANSWERED BY 110 PARENTS OF PEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS AND ANOTHER ONE WAS ANSWERED BY 74 ONCOLOGISTS, MEMBERS OF THE SPANISH SOCIETY OF PEDIATRIC HEMATOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY (SEHOP). LESS THAN HALF OF THE SURVEYED PARENTS (44.5 %) LOOKED FOR INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, WHILE 55.5 % PREFERRED NOT TO DO IT. IN ADDITION, 87.3 % OF THE PARENTS EXPLAIN THAT THEIR DOCTORS DID NOT RECOMMEND ANY INTERNET RESOURCES. AMONG THE ONCOLOGISTS' SAMPLE, 68.9 % OF THE RESPONDENTS DID NOT RECOMMEND SEEKING INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, BUT THEY WOULD CONSIDER IT DESIRABLE FOR THE PATIENTS TO BE GUIDED IN THE SEARCH (82.4 %). THESE RESULTS SHOW SOME DEGREE OF DISSENT BETWEEN THE PARENTS' NEEDS AND THE ONCOLOGISTS' ATTITUDES.

IMPAIRMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS A COMPLEX PROCESS, IT AFFECTS ALL THE THREE BASIC COMPONENTS OF THE BIOSPHERE (SOIL, WATER, AIR) ALWAYS AT THE SAME TIME, BUT THE LEVEL OF THE EFFECT IS DIFFERENT FOR EACH PART. SOILS ARE THREATENED BY TWO BASIC DANGERS: THE VARIOUS SOIL DEGRADATION PROCESSES (WATER AND WIND EROSION, ACIDIFICATION, SALINISATION, PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DEGRADATION, UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES IN THE HUMUS CONTENT AND A DECREASE IN THE BUFFER CAPACITY) AS WELL AS POLLUTION. IN SPITE OF ALL THESE, QUALITY, FUNCTIONALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF SOILS CAN BE PRESERVED AND MAINTAINED. OUR AIM IS DEVELOPING A STATISTICAL BASED INFORMATION SYSTEM FROM THE DATA OF THE HUNGARIAN SOIL INFORMATION MONITORING SYSTEM MEASURED POINTS. WE DEVELOPED A METHOD FOR ESTIMATING ELEMENT CONTENT. TO DETERMINE THE CONCENTRATION OF THE ELEMENTS, WE NEED ONLY THE GPS CO-ORDINATES OF THE PLACE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF NEAREST NEIGHBOURING POINTS. THIS METHOD DOES NOT CALCULATE WITH SPATIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS USING THE KRIGING METHOD (SPATIAL INTERPOLATION) FOR ESTIMATING MORE PRECISELY THE ELEMENT CONTENT. IN THIS STUDY THESE TWO METHODS ARE COMPARED. BUILDING OUR STATISTICAL BASED INFORMATION SYSTEM HAS TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF NEAREST NEIGHBOURING POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS. WE DISCOVERED THAT ELEMENTS CAN BE RANGED ONLY INTO TWO GROUPS DEPENDING ON HOW MANY NEAREST NEIGHBOURING DIAGNOSTIC POINTS WERE CONSIDERED TO KRIGING. 3 NEIGHBOURING DIAGNOSTICAL POINTS: K, P, SR 10 NEIGHBOURING DIAGNOSTICAL POINTS: AL, B, BA, CA, CO, CR, CU, FE, MG, MN, NA, NI, PB, S, TI, V, Y, ZN USING THIS METHOD THE SOIL POLLUTION LOCATIONS AND ELEMENTS AND ITS CONCENTRATION CAN BE DETERMINED. THE OTHER IMPORTANT QUESTION IS TO INVESTIGATE THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS OF THESE SOIL POLLUTIONS. THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA IN THE EUROSTAT DATABASE WHICH CAN SHOW THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC EFFECT OF THESE POLLUTIONS. BASED ON THESE DATA IS CONCLUDED THAT USAGE AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZER, TOTAL POPULATION AND TOTAL GRAIN YIELD ARE THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO SOIL HEAVY METAL POLLUTION. ENTERPRISE AMOUNT, TOTAL CULTIVATED AREA, GROSS VALUE OF FARMING, FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY PRODUCT AS WELL AS TOTAL FREIGHT AMOUNT HAVE LESS IMPACT ON SOIL HEAVY METALS POLLUTION. LAST AND LEAST IMPACT FACTORS ARE GDP AND VALUE OF INDUSTRY OUTPUT IN RURAL AREA. THIS ARTICLE SHOWS OUR RESEARCH RESULTS ON THE FIELD OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS OF SOIL POLLUTION USED BY STATISTICAL ANALYSES, BASED ON THE EUROSTAT DATABASE IN HUNGARY AND ACROSS EUROPE.

THEREFORE, IN AN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE THAT CHANGES SO QUICKLY WITH THE SPREAD OF ICT, APPEARS FUNDAMENTAL TO INVEST IN LONG-LIFE LEARNING, SINCE THE ISOLATION DUE TO IMPRISONMENT RISKS MAKING OBSOLETE OR INADEQUATE THE CIVIC, PROFESSIONAL AND SOCIAL SKILLS OF THE FORMER CONVICT, JUST IN THE CRUCIAL MOMENT OF HIS REINTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY. THIS INVESTMENT, PRECISELY, CANNOT CONSIDER THE EDUCATION TO AND THROUGH THE MEDIA (ESPECIALLY THE EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD AND HYBRID NETWORK MEDIA). BOTH FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CRITICAL RECEPTION, AND FROM THAT OF THE ACTIVE PRODUCTION, THE MEDIA LITERACY (AND SPECIFICALLY E-LITERACY) IS A BASIC PREREQUISITE FOR THE EMPOWERMENT OF INDIVIDUALS AND SOCIAL GROUPS, SINCE IT CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL STEP TO UNDERSTAND THE REALITY, TO SELF-REPRESENT, TO COMMUNICATE, TO UNITE, TO EXPRESS ONESELF AND TO ACT, AS A CITIZEN, WORKER, PERSON.

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE USE THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE MAKE OF ICT. THE METHOD USED FOR THE STUDY IS DESCRIPTIVE USING THE QUESTIONNAIRE TECHNIQUE TO VERIFY THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE ON ICT, INTEREST, TOOLS AND DIFFICULTIES OF ACCESS. RESULTS SHOW THAT ELDERLY PEOPLE CONSIDER POOR THEIR ICT SKILLS, USING THEM PRIMARILY TO COMMUNICATE WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. MOST OF THEM CAN USE THE E-MAIL, CAN OPEN, PRINT AND ATTACH A FILE AND USE INTERNET SEARCH ENGINES TO FIND INFORMATION, THE LOWEST VALUES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SPREADSHEETS, DATABASES AND STATISTICAL PACKAGES. THEY CONSIDER ICT AS BEING USEFUL TO HELP BUILDING COMMUNICATION, DEVELOPING INTEGRATION, GENERATING INFORMATION AMONG PEOPLE AND IMPROVING INTERGENERATIONAL RELATIONSHIP, GATHERING INFORMATION NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE BY OTHER MEANS AND LEARNING NEW SKILLS. THEY HAVE NO FEAR WHEN USING THEM, CONSIDER ATTAINABLE THEIR LEARNING AND SEE MANY POSSIBILITIES IN ITS USE AND THEREFORE WORTH SPENDING TIME AND EFFORT BUT FEEL THAT SOCIETY IS TOO DEPENDENT ON COMPUTERS. IN CONCLUSION, WE CONSIDER ESSENTIAL TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE TO ICT AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR IMPROVING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND THERE ARE NO MAJOR DIFFICULTIES FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT.","UNIV VIGO, FAC CIENCIAS EDUC & DEPORTE, CAMPUS A XUNQUEIRA, VIGO 36005, SPAIN.;  UNIV NACL EDUC DISTANCIA, DEPT FILOL EXTRANJERAS & LINGIST, E-28040 MADRID, SPAIN.","JUSTE, MRP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV VIGO, FAC CIENCIAS EDUC & DEPORTE, CAMPUS A XUNQUEIRA, VIGO 36005, SPAIN.","AGUDO S, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c39-2012-03-10; CABERO J, 2002; CASANOVA J, 2002; CLARKE A, 2001; CLARKE A, 1999; CROSSAN B, 2001; CROWTHER J, 2008; DEJUANAS A, 2013, DOI 10.7179/psri_2013.22.11; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GOMEZ DEL CASTILLO M, 2003; GUIRAO M, 1999; HUBER J, 2005; KIEL J, 2005, DOI 10.1080/14639230500066900; LIMON M, 2011; MAGNUSSON L, 2004; MARCHANT T, 2005, DOI 10.1177/153944920502500203; MILLAN-CALENTI J C, 2003; MILLWARD P, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066; MINGUEZ J G, 1998; RODRIUEZ M, 2008, DOI 10.3916/c30-2008-02-007; NIMROD G, 2010, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnp141; NIMROD G, 2009, DOI 10.1515/ijdhd.2009.8.3.207; NORRIS P, 2001; PAVON F, 2000; PAVON F, 2002; PAVON F, 2000; PAVON F, 2000; PAVON RABASCO F, 2000; PAZOS A, 1997; PEREIRA C, 2011; SELWYN N, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(96)00035-8; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SELWYN N, 2008; STEYAERT, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s10202-005-0017-9; TORP S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00725.x; TRENTIN G, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00061.x; VILLAR F, 2003; WHITE H, 2002, DOI 10.1080/13607860220142422",2,2015,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000377700300014,ISI,UNIV VIGO;UNIV NACL EDUC DISTANCIA,UNIV VIGO,NA,"JUSTE MRP, 2015, PEDAGOG SOC REV INTERUNIV","JUSTE MRP, 2015, PEDAGOG SOC REV INTERUNIV",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.7179/psri_2015.26.13,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,2,"UNIV NACL EDUCACION DISTANCIA-UNED, FAC EDUCACION",NA,WOS

WE HAVE TO KNOW THE FACTORS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR ELIMINATING DISPARITIES IN ICTS.THE FIRST GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO MEASURE OR CALCULATE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN HUNGARY. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A COMPLEX AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL ISSUE, WHICH REQUIRES TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES, VARIABLES, AND TERRITORIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, FACTOR ANALYSIS HAS REVEALED AS A USEFUL TOOL TO CAPTURE THE OVERALL DIMENSION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THEREFORE OUR RESEARCH IS BASED ON DIFFERENT ICT INDICATORS FROM EUROSTAT STATISTICS AND THE EMPIRICA SURVEY RESULTS. OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CIRCUMSTANCES IN HUNGARY. THE INVESTIGATED FIELDS ARE THE FOLLOWINGS: PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH ACCESS TO THE INTERNET; PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH A BROADBAND CONNECTION; PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS REGULARLY USING THE INTERNET AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK; PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NEVER USED A COMPUTER; PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ORDERED GOODS OR SERVICES ONLINE FOR PRIVATE USE. THE CORRELATION MATRIX IN OUR RESEARCH (WHICH COMES FROM FACTOR ANALYSIS) SHOWS THAT ALL VARIABLES ARE CLOSELY RELATED TO EACH OTHER, WITH CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS LARGER THAN 0.8. FOR INSTANCE, THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NEVER USED A COMPUTER IS HIGHLY AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH USING THE INTERNET AND HAVING ACCESS AT HOME BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET THROUGH A COMPUTER. FURTHERMORE, THE HIGH AND POSITIVE CORRELATIONS OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURAL AND USAGE INDICATORS SHOW THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF HIGH-SPEED CONNECTIONS: MANY OF THE LATEST ONLINE SERVICES, ARE ONLY POSSIBLE THROUGH FAST NETWORKS. GIVEN THESE STRONG CORRELATIONS, FACTOR ANALYSIS SEEMS TO BE APPROPRIATE.SINCE THE EU HAS BEEN PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO BRIDGING THE RURAL-URBAN DIGITAL DIVIDE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICT FACTOR AND POPULATION DENSITY HAS ALSO BEEN ANALYZED. FURTHERMORE, THE PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION AGED 65 AND OVER IS INCLUDED TO CAPTURE THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF REGIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES ON THE EXTENT OF ICT ADOPTION. IN THIS SENSE, OLDER PEOPLE OFTEN FACE MORE BARRIERS TO USE ICT THAN YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS. THE HIGHEST CORRELATIONS WITH ICT FACTOR ARE FOUND FOR GDP PER CAPITA, HUMAN RESOURCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, IN CONTRAST TO POPULATION DENSITY, WHICH SHOWS THE LOWEST ONE AMONG THE CONSIDERED VARIABLES.

THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTIMATE THE EXISTENCE OF APPLICATION VENDORS LOCATING IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY SOME REASONS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRY SOFTWARE VENDORS TO ENTER MOBILE APPLICATION MARKETS RATHER THAN MORE TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE MARKETS. WE ARGUE THAT APP STORES OFFER A POSSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES TO PASS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH INDUSTRIALISATION BY PARTLY POST-INDUSTRIALISING DIRECTLY. THIS STUDY IS DIVIDED TO TWO PHASES WHICH STUDY THE EXISTENCE OF APPLICATION VENDORS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS FROM DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS. THE FIRST PHASE FOCUSES ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE MOST POPULAR APPLICATIONS IN GOOGLE PLAY, APPLE STORE AND WINDOWS PHONE STORE. THE SECOND PHASE STARTS BY ANALYSING THE EMAIL ADDRESSES OF APPLICATION VENDORS WHO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS IN GOOGLE PLAY MARKETPLACE FOR DEVICES USING ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM AND CONTINUES BY SENDING QUESTIONNAIRE TO THOSE APPLICATION VENDORS WHOSE EMAIL ADDRESSES HAS COUNTRY DOMAIN BELONGING TO DEVELOPING COUNTRY. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT MOBILE APPLICATIONS ARE DEVELOPED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ALTHOUGH, THE BIGGEST PART OF APPLICATION VENDORS IS LOCATED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. AMONG DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, MOST IMPORTANT MOBILE APPLICATION PRODUCERS BELONG TO UPPER-MIDDLE INCOME ECONOMIES, SUCH AS CHINA OR RUSSIA, OR TO LOWER-MIDDLE INCOME ECONOMIES, SUCH AS INDIA. HOWEVER, THERE APPEARS TO BE FEW APPLICATION VENDORS WHO OPERATE FROM LOW INCOME ECONOMIES, SUCH AS BANGLADESH OR KENYA. ACCORDING TO OUR RESULTS, APPLICATION VENDORS LOCATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES CHOOSE TO DEVELOP MOBILE APPLICATIONS LARGELY DUE TO SAME REASONS THAN APPLICATION VENDORS LOCATED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THEY PREFER MOBILE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES, BECAUSE THEY OFFER EASY ACCESS TO LARGE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.

ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR E-INCLUSION, IN MACEDONIA THE AGE GROUP FROM 55 TO 74 YEARS USES COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET SIGNIFICANTLY LESS, THUS INDICATING A HIGH DISPARITY COMPARED TO OTHER AGE GROUPS. BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE ELDERLY CITIZENS ARE A STRONGLY GROWING POPULATION GROUP IN OUR SOCIETY, THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ICT FOR OLDER PEOPLE IS ESSENTIAL. BUT, IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE MERE PROVISION OF COMPUTER COURSES OR FREE INTERNET ACCESS IS SUFFICIENT IN AIMING TO ACHIEVE A MORE INCLUSIVE INFORMATION SOCIETY. AROUND 120 MILLION EUROPEAN CITIZENS HAVE NEVER USED THE INTERNET, WITH AGE BEING THE PRINCIPAL FACTOR. BULGARIA AND ROMANIA ARE BOTH AMONG THE TOP FIVE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF NON-USERS IN THE EU.

UNFORTUNATELY, POORLY QUALIFIED COLLEAGUES ARE EVEN FOUND IN SECTOR TODAY. THE EU ENSURES THAT THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND CREATIVITY OF THE EUROPEAN WORKFORCE (INCLUDING ICT PRACTITIONERS) MEET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, BY USING EFFECTIVE LIFELONG LEARNING. ICT PROGRAMS OFFER WORKERS THE FULL ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. MORE AND BETTER QUALIFIED ICT PRACTITIONERS AND E-SKILLED MANAGERS ARE NEEDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM. THAT IS WHY E-SKILLS ARE A CENTRAL ASPECT OF EUROPEAN POLICIES, WHICH INCREASE THE COMPETITIVENESS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORKFORCE.

IN THE FIRST PART OF THE ARTICLE, THE USAGE OF NETWORK SERVICES WERE EVALUATED ON TWO REGIONAL LEVELS. ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL, IT ANALYZED THE EU MEMBER STATES, IN ORDER TO COMPARE THEIR ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT LEVEL. ON A MICRO-REGIONAL LEVEL, THE SMES OF A TYPICAL RURAL SETTLEMENT WERE EVALUATED, SINCE WITHIN THE FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS, THE EVALUATION OF RURAL REGIONS HAS GROWN IN IMPORTANCE AND, WITH REGARD TO TERRITORY AND POPULATION, HUNGARY IS MAINLY CLASSIFIED AS A RURAL AREA. 106 ENTERPRISES WERE INVOLVED IN THIS STUDY AND THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE RESEARCH WERE DERIVED BY PRINCIPAL COMPONENT AND CLUSTER ANALYSES. FARMS CONSIDER NETWORK SERVICES TO BE UNNECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK, EVEN THOUGH MOST OF THE FACTORS INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS WERE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT OR EXPRESSLY IMPORTANT BY SERVICE AND COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES, REGARDLESS OF THE APPLICATIONS THEY USE.

FOUR CORE INTERNET USAGE TYPES ARE CONSTRUCTED AND PREDICTED BY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES IN A STRUCTURAL MODEL. OVERALL, THE FINDINGS CONFIRM THE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED SHIFT IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FROM ACCESS TO USAGE IN FIVE FURTHER COUNTRIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS ALONE ACCOUNT FOR UP TO HALF OF THE VARIANCE IN USAGE IN THESE HIGH-PENETRATION COUNTRIES, WITH AGE BEING THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR. MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE TESTS INDICATE THAT A DIRECT COMPARISON IS ONLY VALID BETWEEN THREE OF THE FIVE COUNTRIES EXPLORED.

STUDIES AVAILABLE AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IN EUROPE FOCUS ON ICT USE BY HOUSEHOLDS. THIS PAPER SHEDS LIGHT ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY EXPLORING THE DIFFERENCES IN ICT USE ACROSS EUROPEAN REGIONS, INVESTIGATING SIMULTANEOUSLY NOT ONLY ICT USE BY HOUSEHOLDS BUT ALSO BY FIRMS. USING CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS, WE FIRST EXPLORE THE EXISTENCE OF REGIONAL PATTERNS OF ICT USE IN EUROPE. SECOND, WE TEST THE INFLUENCE OF REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS TO EXPLAIN ICT USE BY HOUSEHOLDS AND FIRMS. OUR RESULTS IDENTIFY A FIRST PATTERN DEFINED BY THE REGIONS THAT COMBINE HIGH LEVELS OF BOTH ICT USES. THIS PATTERN IS EXPLAINED PRIMARILY BY THE QUALITY OF THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT, KNOWLEDGE-INTENSIVE SERVICES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES. A DIVIDE BETWEEN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN, AND WESTERN AND EASTERN REGIONS IS DETECTED. WE ALSO IDENTIFY A SECOND PATTERN THAT CAPTURES ICT USE BY FIRMS (NOT RELATED TO THE FIRST), PREDOMINANTLY DETERMINED BY EDUCATIONAL VARIABLES AND SOME ECONOMIC FACTORS. THIS PATTERN DOES NOT EXHIBIT THE GEOGRAPHICAL DIGITAL DIVIDE FOUND IN THE FIRST. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THERE ARE SYNERGIES AND REGIONAL FACTORS EXPLAINING THE USE OF ICT BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IN EUROPE THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN DESIGNING PUBLIC POLICY GEARED TOWARD ENCOURAGING ICT DIFFUSION.","UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, DEPT ECON STRUCT & DEV ECON, CARRETERA COLMENAR VIEJO,KM 15 CAMPUS CANTOBLANCO, E-28049 MADRID, SPAIN.;  UNIV PUBL NAVARRA, DEPT ECON, CAMPUS ARROSADIA S-N, PAMPLONA 31006, SPAIN.;  UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, DEPT APPL ECON, CARRETERA COLMENAR VIEJO,KM 15 CAMPUS CANTOBLANCO, E-28049 MADRID, SPAIN.","LERA-LOPEZ, F (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV PUBL NAVARRA, DEPT ECON, CAMPUS ARROSADIA S-N, PAMPLONA 31006, SPAIN.","ANDRES L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.01.003; BALIAMOUNE-LUTZ M, 2003, DOI 10.1002/itdj.1590100303; BENHABIB J, 2005; BILLON M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/09654310701748009; BILLON M, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10290-009-0045-y; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.006; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00461.x; CAMAGNI R, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s00168-005-0244-y; CAMAGNI R, 1991; CAMAGNI R, 2013, DOI 10.1111/grow.12012; CAMAGNI R, 2009, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-70924-4_7; CHARRON N, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11205-014-0702-y; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; CHINN M, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9396.2009.00861.x; COHEN W, 1989, DOI 10.2307/2233763; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; DASGUPTA S, 2005, DOI 10.1080/13600810500137889; DOMENECH J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/13504851.2013.864032; EVANGELISTA R, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10438599.2014.918438; FAIRLIE R, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1465-7295.2009.00218.x; FORMAN C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2004.10.005; FUJITA M, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1435-5957.2005.00021.x; GALLIANO D, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s00168-007-0157-z; GALLIANO D, 2011, DOI 10.1068/a43167; GASPAR J, 1998, DOI 10.1006/juec.1996.2031; GEROSKI P, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00092-x; GRUBESIC T, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00021-6; GRUBESIC T, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2008.01.001; GRUBESIC T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.11.017; HAIR J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.02.019; HALLER S, 2011, DOI 10.1080/00036841003724411; HARGITTAI E, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6; HORRIGAN J, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904290; JOHNSON R, 2007; KIISKI S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3; KOTTEMANN J, 2009, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20114; LERA-LOPEZ F, 2011, DOI 10.1080/10438590903378017; LI R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.06.004; LUNDVALL B, 2016; MANSFIELD E, 1968; MARTIN L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2014.978072; MARTINELLI M, 2006; MORGAN K, 1997, DOI 10.1080/00343409750132289; NELSON R R, 1993; NELSON R, 1966; NEOKOSMIDIS I, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.006; OECD, 2013, DOI 10.1787/9789264204256-5-en; OYANA T, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.09.003; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; PRIEGER J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.11.003; ROGERS E, 2010; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; ROSENBERG N, 1972, DOI 10.1016/0014-4983(72)90001-0; SCHLEIFE K, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003; SINGH S, 2012, DOI 10.1108/14468951211213859; SLEUWAEGEN L, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.014; STANDING C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2008.10.001; STIAKAKIS E, 2010; STORPER M, 2004, DOI 10.1093/jnlecg/lbh027; TAPPEINER G, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2007.07.013; TRANOS E, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0969776409340866; TURK T, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2007.08.004; CUERVO M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2006.05.001; ZHU K, 2003, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000475",18,2016,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS; INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,WOS:000386124300002,ISI,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID;UNIV PUBL NAVARRA;UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,UNIV PUBL NAVARRA,NA,"BILLON M, 2016, REV WORLD ECON","BILLON M, 2016, REV WORLD ECON",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1007/s10290-016-0259-8,NA,ECONOMICS; INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,19,SPRINGER,NA,WOS

INFORM.,ARTICLE,GLASGOW; BROADBAND SPEED; DIGITAL DIVIDE,INTERNET ACCESS,"IT IS WIDELY ARGUED THAT BROADBAND IS BENEFICIAL. HIGHER RATES OF BROADBAND PENETRATION AND ADOPTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHILE FOR INDIVIDUALS ACCESSING THE INTERNET THROUGH A BROADBAND CONNECTION OPENS UP A RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM. HOWEVER, TO ENJOY THESE OPPORTUNITIES USERS NEED ACCESS TO BOTH AN INTERNET CONNECTION AS WELL AS THE POSSESSION OF A RANGE OF SKILLS. AS NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO ONE OR BOTH OF THESE, A RANGE OF DIGITAL DIVIDES HAVE EMERGED WITHIN AND BETWEEN COUNTRIES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES ONE ASPECT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDES THAT HAVE EMERGED, NAMELY, SPEED. BROADBAND SPEEDS VARY CONSIDERABLY, REFLECTING MANY FACTORS SUCH AS THE TECHNOLOGY(S) USED, THE NUMBER OF USERS, THE DISTANCE OF THE USER FROM THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE AND SO FORTH. RATHER THAN EXPLORE THE DIGITAL DIVIDES THAT EXIST BETWEEN COUNTRIES, WE FOCUS ON A SINGLE CITY: GLASGOW. USING DATA FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES WE EXPLORE BROADBAND SPEEDS ACROSS THE CITY. WHILE BROADBAND SPEEDS HAVE IMPROVED ACROSS MUCH OF GLASGOW, THIS IS NOT TRUE EVERY PART OF THE CITY. AVERAGE SPEEDS VARY CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE CITY, WITH THE CONSEQUENCE THAT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE ALSO VARIES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THOSE PARTS OF THE CITY WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DEPRIVATION ENJOY HIGHER BROADBAND SPEEDS THAN AREAS WITHIN GLASGOW OF HIGHER DEPRIVATION LEVELS. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO FOUND THAT CONSIDERABLE VARIATIONS EXIST BETWEEN SERVICE PROVIDERS. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

EBBERS W; JANSEN M; VAN DEURSEN A,IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ON E-GOVERNMENT: EXPANDING FROM CHANNEL CHOICE TO CHANNEL USAGE,GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY,GOV. INF. Q.,ARTICLE,NA,ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT; INTERNET SKILLS; COMPLEXITY; MANAGEMENT,"MANY SCHOLARS HAVE STUDIED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, HOWEVER, OFTEN APART FROM EGOVERNMENT RESEARCH. THEREFORE, MORE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IS REQUIRED AS EGOVERNMENT CAN BE BOTH HINDERED BY AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. FIRST RESEARCH STEPS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN, FOR INSTANCE BY USING ACCESS AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AS REPRESENTATIONS FOR THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE DISCIPLINE HAS DEVELOPED RAPIDLY AND CONTEMPORARY RESEARCH FINDINGS INDICATE THAT, AT LEAST IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, NOT ACCESS AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, BUT DIGITAL SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO EXPLORE NEW EXPLANATIONS IN CHANNEL CHOICE, WE INCORPORATED FURTHER DEVELOPED DIGITAL SKILLS MEASUREMENTS INTO EGOVERNMENT RESEARCH CHANNEL CHOICE MEASUREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES THE CITIZEN'S PERSPECTIVE BY STUDYING ACTUAL CHANNEL USE IN THE NETHERLANDS. RESULTS SHOW THAT, SURPRISINGLY, DIGITAL SKILLS DO NEITHER PREDICT NOR RELATE TO CHOOSING THE ONLINE CHANNEL. HOWEVER, THEY DO PREDICT THE DEGREE OF SATISFACTION; THE MORE DIGITALLY SKILLED CITIZENS ARE, THE MORE SATISFIED THEY ARE WITH ONLINE SERVICES. RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE NATURE OF INTERACTION SIGNIFICANTLY COHERES WITH CHANNEL CHOICE: REGISTRATION CORRELATES WITH CHOOSING ONLINE CHANNELS, CONSULTATION CORRELATES WITH CHOOSING OFFLINE CHANNELS. THESE FINDINGS BRING US TO THE THESIS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE UPTAKE OF EGOVERNMENT, AT LEAST IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, DIGITAL SKILLS BECOME LESS RELEVANT. HOWEVER, THEY COME INTO PLAY WHEN IT CONCERNS THE PERCEIVED QUALITY, EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF SATISFACTION. THIS COULD MEAN THAT, IN THE LONG RUN, MANY CITIZENS ARE GOING TO USE EGOVERNMENT ANYWAY, NO MATTER HOW (UN)SKILLED THEY ARE, NO MATTER HOW COMPLEX THESE SERVICES ARE. AS SUCH, WE SEE THE EMERGENCE OF A NEW IMPORTANT RESEARCH QUESTION IN THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY DOMAIN OF EGOVERNMENT. NAMELY, WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF CHANNEL USE FOR POLICY IMPLEMENTATION? BECAUSE IF LESS DIGITALLY SKILLED CITIZENS ARE USING ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT SERVICES ANYWAY, WHAT HAPPENS TO POLICY GOALS THAT HEAVILY RELY ON ONLINE SERVICES? (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC.

BASED ON A NATIONAL SURVEY OF AMERICAN ADULTS, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THIS QUESTION THROUGH CONSIDERING BOTH BARRIERS TO INTERNET USE AND THE POSSIBILITIES THE INTERNET OFFERS PWD. FINDINGS INDICATE BARRIERS FOR MANY PWD TO ACCESSING THE INTERNET. THOSE WITH FIVE OF SIX TYPES OF DISABILITIES MEASURED ARE CONSIDERABLY LESS LIKELY TO BE ONLINE THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT DISABLED. PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF OR HEARING IMPAIRED TO DO NOT LAG IN INTERNET ACCESS ONCE WE ACCOUNT FOR DEMOGRAPHICS, WEB USE SKILLS, AND INTERNET EXPERIENCES. HOWEVER, THE STUDY ALSO FINDS EVIDENCE THAT ONCE ONLINE, PWD ENGAGE IN A RANGE OF USES OF THE INTERNET AS MUCH AS PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITY. MOREOVER, PWD TAKE DISTINCT INTEREST IN CERTAIN ONLINE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS SHARING THEIR OWN CONTENT AND REVIEWING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, POINTING TO WAYS THEY MAY GO ONLINE TO ADAPT AND RESPOND TO THE WIDER INACCESSIBLE SOCIETY. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR THE INTERNET FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SUGGEST THAT MOVING MORE OF THEM ONLINE HOLDS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONSIDERABLE GAINS AMONG THIS GROUP.

THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE DEARTH OF RESEARCH ASSESSING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN POLICY AND INTERNET PENETRATION BY IDENTIFYING INTERNET PENETRATION-RELATED POLICY VARIABLES AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRUCTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. BASED ON A LITERATURE REVIEW AND DATA AVAILABILITY, FOUR VARIABLES ARE SUGGESTED: (I) FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION; (II) MARKET CONCENTRATION; (III) THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND (USF); AND (IV) TOTAL TAX ON COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ONLY THE ACTIVITY LEVEL OF THE USF AND LOW TOTAL TAX ON COMPUTER EQUIPMENT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY RELATED TO INTERNET PENETRATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION AND MARKET CONCENTRATION DO NOT SHOW ANY IMPACT ON INTERNET PENETRATION. THE LATTER COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO UNDERDEVELOPED COMPETITION IN MOST SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES.

AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY DENIED ACCESS TO ONLINE AND SOCIAL MEDIA THAT MOST OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED, PHYSICALLY CUT OFF FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN WAYS THAT HAVE BECOME NORMAL IN SOCIETY, WE ARGUE THAT PRISONERS EXPERIENCE PROFOUND SOCIAL ISOLATION AND CONSTITUTE ONE OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED GROUPS IN THE DIGITAL AGE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PRISONERS DISPLAY HIGH LEVELS OF BOTH CURIOSITY AND ENTHUSIASM AS WELL AS FEAR AND RESERVATION TOWARD INTERNET-ENABLED TECHNOLOGIES, DEPENDING ON AGE AND GENDER AS WELL AS THE LENGTH OF THEIR SENTENCE. ON RELEASE FROM PRISON, THEY ARE NOT ONLY FACED WITH PREJUDICE AND POORER JOB PROSPECTS THAN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DUE TO THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD, BUT THEIR DIGITAL EXCLUSION DURING INCARCERATION MAY HAVE COMPOUND EFFECTS AND LEAD TO SUPERCHARGED DIGITAL AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION. WE ARGUE THAT SECURE ACCESS WOULD BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL TO PRISONERS WHO POSE A LOW RISK TO SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE REHABILITATION AND RELEASE PHASES.","MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, QUELLO CTR, 406 COMMUN ARTS BLDG, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;  UNIV BRIGHTON, SCH APPL SOCIAL SCI, BRIGHTON, E SUSSEX, ENGLAND.","REISDORF, BC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, QUELLO CTR, 406 COMMUN ARTS BLDG, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.","ANARAKI S, 2003; CHAMPION N, 2013; CHATMAN E, 1991, DOI 10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199107)42:6<438::aid-asi6>3.0.cob; CHATMAN E, 1999, DOI 10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:3<207::aid-asi3>3.3.co#; CREWE B, 2007, DOI 10.1093/bjc/azl044; CREWE B, 2009; DUTTON W, 2013; ESPOSITO J, 2000; HARTMAN K J, 2000; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323113499113; INGS C, 2011, DOI 10.1353/lib.2011.0002; JEWKES Y, 2008; JEWKES Y, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2311.2009.00559.x; JEWKES Y, 2017; JOHNSON R, 2005; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MINISTRY OF J, 2013; NORRIS P, 2001; PAYNE W, 2007, DOI 10.1300/j103v26n02_01; REISDORF B, 2011, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.543141; ROGERS E, 2001, DOI 10.1177/135485650100700406; SCHAUPP L, 2014, DOI 10.2308/isys-50674; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SOCIAL EXCLUSION U, 2002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.001; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",17,2016,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000372732400005,ISI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIV;UNIV BRIGHTON,MICHIGAN STATE UNIV,NA,"REISDORF BC, 2016, INFO COMMUN SOC","REISDORF BC, 2016, INFO COMMUN SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;USA,10.1080/1369118x.2016.1153124,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE DIFFERENT CULTURAL TRENDS (OR HABITS) AMONG DIGITAL ""NATIVES"" (TEENS) AND DIGITAL ""IMMIGRANTS"" (PARENTS AND TEACHERS). THE RESEARCH, CARRIED OUT BY FOURTEEN RESEARCHERS FROM FIVE DIFFERENT SPANISH UNIVERSITIES, IS BASED ON THE LABORIOUS PROCESS OF QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THE STUDY'S RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN GENERATIONS DOES EXIST, BUT THAT THE CONCEPTS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ICT ARE OFTEN USED VERY SUPERFICIALLY, BECAUSE THEY ALSO AFFECT THE WAY USERS RELATE TO EACH OTHER (ICRT). WHILE YOUNG USERS EMPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN INFORMAL CONTEXTS (SOCIAL NETWORKS), ADULTS TEND TO USE THEM MORE IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL ENVIRONMENT. ADULTS FACE A CHANGE IN THE CULTURAL PARADIGM IN WHICH AN INVERSION OF THE CONVENTIONAL EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OCCURS. TEENAGERS HAVE MORE PRACTICAL SKILLS, INTEGRATING ONLINE ENVIRONMENTS INTO THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE, WHILE ADULTS REGARD THEM AS BEING A ""WORLD APART"". HENCE, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN YOUNG USERS AND ADULTS IS PRIMARILY SOCIOCULTURAL.","UNIV SEVILLE, FAC COMUNICAC, SEVILLE, SPAIN.;  UNIV RAMON LLULL, FAC COMUNICAC BLANQUERNA, SEVILLE, SPAIN.","GARRIDO-LORA, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SEVILLE, FAC COMUNICAC, SEVILLE, SPAIN.","ARANDA D, 2009; BALLANO S, 2014, DOI 10.15581/003.27.4.147-155; BARICCO A, 2008; BRINGUE X, 2009; BUSQUET J, 2013, DOI 10.14198/medc0m20l3.4.2.06; BUSQUET J, 2012; BUSQUET J, 2012; CARR N, 2011; CASTELLS M, 2006; CASTELLS M, 2007; CASTELLS M, 2009; DONOVAN M, 2011; ELZO J, 2000; FEIXA C, 2006; GABELAS J A, 2012; GABELAS-BARROSO J A, 2015; GARMENDIA M, 2011; GIDDENS A, 2000; HADDON L, 2009; ITO M, 2009; ITO M, 2008; JENKINS H, 2006; JENKINS H, 2008; KUPIAINEN R, 2013; LIVINGSTONE S, 2002; LIVINGSTONE S, 2009; MAFFESOLI, 1990; PRENSKY M, 2001; RHEINGOLD H, 2004; RUBIO A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004003; SANCHEZ-NAVARRO J, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323111432411; TAPSCOTT D, 2009; TAPSCOTT D, 1998; VALKENBURG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020; WELLMAN B, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2003.tb00216.x; WINOCUR R, 2007",24,2016,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000385299900004,ISI,UNIV SEVILLE;UNIV RAMON LLULL,UNIV SEVILLE,NA,"GARRIDO-LORA M, 2016, ANALISI","GARRIDO-LORA M, 2016, ANALISI",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.7238/a.v0i54.2953,NA,COMMUNICATION,26,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,NA,WOS

LOOKING AT THE DETERMINANTS OF MOBILE NETWORK COVERAGE HELPS HIGHLIGHT BOTH OPERATORS' STRATEGIES AND INDIVIDUAL USERS' DECISIONS. SUBSCRIBERS OFTEN INSTALL SMALL WIRELESS ANTENNAS CALLED FEMTO-CELLS WITHIN BUILDINGS WITH POOR SIGNAL. THE LOCATION AND DENSITY OF THESE ANTENNAS PROVIDES INFORMATION FOR AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT DEMAND BUT POOR COVERAGE-AREAS WHERE COVERAGE IS EFFECTIVELY CROWDSOURCED. IN CONTRAST TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIXED-LINE NETWORKS, AVERAGE INCOME, POPULATION, GEOGRAPHY, AND EDUCATION ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF BOTH TELECOM AND FEMTO-CELL BASED MOBILE COVERAGE. LOW-INCOME REGIONS ARE FOUND TO RECEIVE ALMOST 15% LESS COVERAGE COMPARED TO THEIR AFFLUENT COUNTERPARTS AND HAVE TWO FEWER TELECOM BASE STATIONS INSTALLED FOR EQUAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF (POTENTIAL) SUBSCRIBERS. BASE STATIONS TEND TO BE AT LEAST THREE TIMES FURTHER FROM LOWER-INCOME SUBSCRIBERS. WITHIN POORLY-COVERED AREAS, WEALTHIER HOUSEHOLDS ARE ABLE TO COMPENSATE BY INVESTING IN FEMTO-CELLS, BUT POORER HOUSEHOLDS ARE OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM COMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET.

THE RESEARCH FINDINGS SHOW THAT, ALTHOUGH STRUCTURAL VARIABLES INEVITABLY INFLUENCE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA, TEENAGERS FROM LOWER-INCOME' FAMILIES ARE MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION AND RELATIONAL FEATURES OF THESE SITES. IN CONTRAST, THEIR PEERS FROM ELITE' FAMILIES FOCUS ON THE CAPITAL-ENHANCING OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY SNSS AND DISPLAY A CRITICAL STANCE THAT LEADS THEM TO LIMIT THEIR SOCIAL ACTIVITIES ON THESE PLATFORMS. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SNSS ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM DIGITAL INEQUALITIES, BUT NONETHELESS PROVIDE NOVEL OPPORTUNITIES TO LOWER-INCOME TEENAGERS.","UNIV MILANO BICOCCA, DEPT SOCIOL & SOCIAL RES, VIA BICOCCA ARCIMBOLDI 8, I-20126 MILAN, ITALY.","MICHELI, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MILANO BICOCCA, DEPT SOCIOL & SOCIAL RES, VIA BICOCCA ARCIMBOLDI 8, I-20126 MILAN, ITALY.","AHN J, 2011, DOI 10.2190/ec.45.2.b; BENNETT S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x; BERRIMAN L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/13676261.2014.992323; BLANK G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.777758; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOURDIEU P, 1965; BOURDIEU P, 1979; BOURDIEU P, 1973, DOI 10.4324/9781351018142-3; BOYD D, 2010; BOYD D, 2014; BOYD D, 2012; BOYD D, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x; CLARK L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902823845; CORREA T, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01532.x; DUGGAN M S, 2013; EARL J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1008544; GOBO G, 2001; GUI M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389751; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HAMMERSLEY M, 2008, DOI 10.4135/9780857024329.d4; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00396.x; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HARRISON E, 2006; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HOLSTEIN J, 1995; HOOVER S, 2004; ITO M, 2010; LAMBERT A, 2015; LAREAU A, 2003; LITT E, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.049; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MASCHERONI G, 2014; MICHELI M, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010003; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; SAVAGE M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0038038513481128; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SILVERMAN D, 2000; SIMS C, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.808363; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WACQUANT L, 1997, DOI 10.1111/1468-2427.00076; WITTE J, 2010; ZHANG Y, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1461444813520477; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",28,2016,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000371599200002,ISI,UNIV MILANO BICOCCA,UNIV MILANO BICOCCA,NA,"MICHELI M, 2016, INFO COMMUN SOC","MICHELI M, 2016, INFO COMMUN SOC",ITALY,10.1080/1369118x.2016.1139614,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",'REGIONE LOMBARDIA' EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND,WOS

THIS STUDY FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON THE SO-CALLED GREY DIVIDE', A DIVIDE AMONG SENIORS OF AGE 65+ YEARS. BASED ON A REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY IN SWITZERLAND (N = 1105), IT IS FOUND THAT INTERNET USE IS STRONGLY SKEWED IN THIS AGE GROUP LEADING TO A PARTIAL EXCLUSION OF THE OLD SENIORS (70+). LOGISTIC REGRESSION SHOWS THAT GENDER DIFFERENCES IN USAGE DISAPPEAR IF CONTROLLED FOR EDUCATION, INCOME, TECHNICAL INTEREST, PRE-RETIREMENT COMPUTER USE AND MARITAL STATUS. FURTHERMORE, THE SOCIAL CONTEXT APPEARS TO HAVE A MANIFOLD INFLUENCE ON INTERNET USE. ENCOURAGEMENT BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IS A STRONG PREDICTOR FOR INTERNET USE, AND PRIVATE LEARNING SETTINGS ARE PREFERRED OVER PROFESSIONAL COURSES. IMPLICATIONS FOR DIGITAL INEQUALITY INITIATIVES AND FURTHER RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED.","UNIV BREMEN, CTR MEDIA COMMUN & INFORMAT RES, COMMUN & MEDIA RES, D-28359 BREMEN, GERMANY.;  UNIV BREMEN, ZEMKI LAB NETWORKED COMMUN, D-28359 BREMEN, GERMANY.","FRIEMEL, TN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV BREMEN, CTR MEDIA COMMUN & INFORMAT RES, LINZER STR 6, D-28359 BREMEN, GERMANY.","BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; CHARNESS N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01647.x; COMPEAU D, 1995, DOI 10.2307/249688; DEMUNTER C, 2005; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; DOBRANSKY K, 2012, DOI 10.1080/10410236.2011.585451; DUTTON W, 2013; FRIEMEL T N, 2010; FRIEMEL T, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2011.08.002; GILLEARD C, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10433-008-0083-7; GILLY M, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-6606.2011.01218.x; GUNTHER A, 1991, DOI 10.1177/009365091018003004; HAKKARAINEN P, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1461444812442663; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HSIEH J, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0256; KATZ J, 2002; KHVOROSTIANOV N, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1461444811421599; KIM H, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00369.x; KIM Y, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03601270802000576; KORUPP S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/esr/jci030; LATZER M, 2019; LAZARSFELD P, 1968; LEE B, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.01.003; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; MADDEN M, 2013; MELENHORST A, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.21.1.190; MORRIS A, 2007, DOI 10.11645/1.3.14; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; NIMROD G, 2010, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnp141; NORRIS P, 2003; PEACOCK S, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10433-007-0067-z; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; PFEIL U, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01523.x; RAINS S, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208315958; RICE R, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.07.032; RICE R, 1990, DOI 10.1016/0378-8733(90)90021-z; RICHARDSON M, 2005, DOI 10.1177/1461444805050763; RIESEN S, 2006; RIGGINS F, 2005; ROGERS E, 2010; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; VICENTE M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01615440903423245; ROTHE G, 1987; SALMON C, 2013; SCHELLING H, 2010; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; SHAPIRA N, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13607860601086546; SLEGERS K, 2008, DOI 10.1093/geronb/63.3.p176; SMITH A, 2014; SNIJDERS T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2009.02.004; SOURBATI M, 2009, DOI 10.1177/1461444809340786; SUM S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01437.x; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN EIMEREN B, 2013; WAGNER N, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.029; WEI L, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01578.x; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; XIE B, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.00417.x; YAO M, 2007, DOI 10.1002/asi.20530; ZICKUHR K, 2012",347,2016,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000368546600008,ISI,UNIV BREMEN;UNIV BREMEN,UNIV BREMEN,NA,"FRIEMEL TN, 2016, NEW MEDIA SOC","FRIEMEL TN, 2016, NEW MEDIA SOC",GERMANY;GERMANY,10.1177/1461444814538648,NA,COMMUNICATION,352,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,PRO SENECTUTE SCHWEIZ; BUNDESAMT FUR KOMMUNIKATION BAKOM; POSTFINANCE; SWISSCOM,WOS

BUILDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS IN RURAL AREAS IS COSTLY. FURTHER, IN MANY CASES, THERE IS NOT A GOOD COMMERCIAL BUSINESS CASE FOR RURAL DEPLOYMENTS. WHEREAS ESTABLISHED AND COMPETITIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS ALREADY OFFER SOLUTIONS FOR URBAN AND SUBURBAN AREAS, THERE IS LITTLE OR NO COMMITMENT TO CONNECT AREAS THAT INCLUDE SMALLER TOWNS AND RURAL VILLAGES.

HOWEVER, DESPITE THE GROWTH IN THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY, THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES AT A LOCAL AND GLOBAL LEVEL, WHICH DEMAND AN URGENT STUDY AND ANALYSIS. IT IS CRUCIAL TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS, GROUPS AND CULTURES FROM THE MARGINS AND UNDERSTAND HOW ICT CAN INFLUENCE SOCIAL INCLUSION(S) OR EXCLUSION(S). THEREFORE, THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND INCLUSION(S) AND EXCLUSION(S) CAUSED BY THE TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD AMONG A SPECIFIC GROUP, THIS BEING IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN PORTUGAL. THE TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD AND THE INTERNET SHOW MULTIPLE DIVISIONS, REPRESENTED BY THE CONCEPT OF DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS DIVIDE IS EXPRESSED, NAMELY, IN THE DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING AND USING TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION, CREATING MULTIPLE BARRIERS FOR IMMIGRANT WOMEN. THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS REMAINED UNDERSTUDIED IN PORTUGAL, MAKING IT RELEVANT TO CONJURE UP CONNECTIONS BETWEEN GENDER STUDIES, CULTURAL STUDIES AND INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES. IT IS THEN CRUCIAL TO QUESTION THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AND UNDERSTAND HOW MARGINALISED GROUPS, IN PARTICULAR IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN PORTUGAL, (RE) STRUCTURE AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES IN THE DIGITAL AREA. SEVERAL FACTORS ARE BROUGHT TO THE DISCUSSION, SPECIFICALLY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AGE, ORIGIN, ACADEMIC/EDUCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS, AND PROFESSION, IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE CAN INFLUENCE ACCESS AND ABILITY TO USE ICT, AS WELL AS HOW THEY ARE USED BY THE IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN ORDER TO HAVE A VOICE IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. WE HAVE STUDIED AND ANALYSED CONTEMPORARY ACADEMIC LITERATURE FROM TRANSDISCIPLINARY SUBJECTS, SUCH AS INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES, GENDER STUDIES AND CULTURAL STUDIES, SERVING AS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS FOR OUR REFLECTIONS. WE HAVE THEN USED EMPIRICAL DATA, STATISTICS AND OFFICIAL STUDIES UNDERTAKEN IN PORTUGAL IN ORDER TO SUPPORT OUR CONSIDERATIONS. THE DATA WE HAVE GATHERED HAS AS ITS MAIN FOCUS THE NUMBERS OF ACCESS AND USE OF ICT AND INTERNET BY THESE WOMEN, THUS COMPLEMENTING THE STUDY OF ARTICLES ON THE THEMES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A THEORETICAL EXAMINATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN PORTUGAL, AIMING AT CONTRIBUTING TO A FURTHER UNDERSTANDING OF DICHOTOMIES (INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS) CREATED BY ICT AND ACCESS TO INTERNET. WE CONCLUDED THAT IMMIGRANT WOMEN IN PORTUGAL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO INTERNET, AND ICT IN GENERAL, COMPARED TO PORTUGUESE WOMEN, AND ALSO THAT THE LEVEL OF ACCESS VARIES ACCORDING TO NATIONALITY, AGE, PROFESSION, QUALIFICATION AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS.

GOV.-PEOPLE PROCESS POLICY,ARTICLE,COMMON SERVICES CENTRES (CSC); E-GOVERNANCE; ELECTRONIC GOVERNANCE; PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY; RURAL CONNECTIVITY; VILLAGE LEVEL ENTREPRENEURS,GOVERNMENT,"PURPOSE - DESPITE THE INCREASING TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES AND ITS AFFORDABILITY, A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE PROPORTION OF DEVELOPING NATIONS' POPULATION ARE STILL LACKING RESOURCES TO OWN BASIC INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS COMPUTER AND INTERNET. THIS SUGGESTS THAT MAJORITY OF THE CITIZENS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (E.G. INDIA) ARE ALSO NOT ABLE TO ACCESS AND USE EMERGING ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THIS IS LEADING TO A FURTHER AND BIGGER DIGITAL DIVIDE GAP THAT ALREADY EXISTS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AS WELL AS ECONOMICALLY LESS AND MORE ABLE POPULATION. TO REDUCE THE WIDENING DIGITAL DIVIDE, INDIA HAS INNOVATED COMMON SERVICES CENTRES (CSCS) AS MEANS TO DELIVER PUBLIC SERVICES ELECTRONICALLY TO CITIZENS AT THE VILLAGE LEVEL. THIS VIEWPOINT PAPER AIMS TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES OF SUCH CSCS AND TO OFFER SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEIR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATIONS AND SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS IS A VIEWPOINT PAPER THAT IS BASED ON AUTHORS' AWARENESS OF THE CONTEXT AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE AND ISSUES RELEVANT TO THE RESEARCH TOPIC. ANUMBER OF APPROPRIATE AND CURRENT CITATIONS HAVE BEEN UTILISED TO ILLUSTRATE THE CURRENT STATE ON THE TOPIC AS WELL AS TO SUPPORT AUTHORS' ARGUMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER. FINDINGS - THE PAPER IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES RELEVANT FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION AND SUSTAINABLE OPERATION OF CSCS. THE AUTHORS PRESENT THEIR VIEWS AND RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING KEY ISSUES: CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS, LACK OF OR DELAYED ROLLOUT OF GOVERNMENT TO CITIZEN (G2C) SERVICES, DEMOTIVATED VILLAGE-LEVEL ENTREPRENEURS DUE TO LACK OF G2C SERVICES, LOW COMPUTER LITERACY, LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT SERVICES AND FACILITIES, LACK OF ADEQUATE TRAINING AND SUPPORT, POOR PROVISIONING OF AN EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE, LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE CONCERNED GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, INACCESSIBLE LOCATIONS, BURDEN OF HIGH INVESTMENT, CORRUPTION AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL, LACK OF SKILLED MANPOWER TO RUN THE CSCS, LACK OF POWER SUPPLY, LANGUAGE BARRIER, LACK OF SPACE, PROBLEM WITH MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF CONNECTIVITY NETWORK AND PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE NAXALITE AND ANARCHIST ACTIVITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER WOULD BE VALUABLE TO VARIOUS AGENCIES (BOTH FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS) AS WELL AS POLICYMAKERS FOR EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION AND LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF CSCS.

IN THIS PAPER WE SOUGHT TO EXPLORE TEACHERS KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF ICT RESOURCES IN THE CONTEXT OF FREE/LIBRE AND OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE (FLOSS). WHEN RELYING PERMANENTLY ON FREE TOOLS THERE ARE SEVERAL BENEFITS WHICH IN TURN WILL GROW SUSTAINABLE INFORMATION SOCIETY AND WILL FORTIFY ECONOMY IN LARGER SCALE. FOR THE MENTIONED PURPOSE WE USE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (TAM) FIRST VERSION. WE FOUND THAT TAM MODEL IS NOT IDEAL TO ACCOMPLISH MENTIONED TASKS, ESPECIALLY IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

WE CONCENTRATE ON THE FEDERAL E-PETITIONS PORTAL - RUSSIAN PUBLIC INITIATIVE - AND USE THE AUTOMATED MONITORING SYSTEM TO ANALYSE SUBNATIONAL DYNAMICS OF ONLINE PETITIONS SUBMISSIONS AND VOTING ON THE AGGREGATE LEVEL. THE DATA ARE USED TO QUANTITATIVELY ASSESS THE DRIVERS AND OBSTACLES FOR E-PARTICIPATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MORE ACTIVE E-PETITION PORTAL USAGE IN REGIONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS WITH DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND BETTER E-GOVERNMENT POLICY. ONE OF THE MAIN OBSTACLES TO ACTIVE USE OF THE PORTAL IS ITS INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN THAT AT THE MOMENT PROVIDES REGIONS WITH DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND REINFORCES PARTICIPATION DIVIDES.

THE RESEARCH USES THE SURVEY METHOD AND A QUESTIONNAIRE HAS BEEN APPLIED TO A SAMPLE OF 382 STUDENTS ENTERING THE UNIVERSITY OF SEVILLE VIA THE SPECIAL ROUTES FOR OLDER THAN 25, THAN 40 AND 45 YEARS. RESULTS SHOWED A GENERAL POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE ICT, WHICH COULD ALSO BE QUALIFIED AS PRAGMATIC, SINCE THE TOOLS ARE POSITIVELY VALUED BASED ON THEIR POTENTIAL BENEFITS IN THE LEARNING PROCESSES. RESULTS ALSO POINT TO THE FACT THAT STUDENTS HAVE NOT BEEN SPECIFICALLY TRAINED IN THE USE OF ITC. THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY THAT THEY CLAIM TO POSSESS REGARDING THE USE OF THESE RESOURCES IS MEDIUM-LOW. FURTHERMORE, THE OVER 45 YEAR GROUP DECLARE THEMSELVES LESS COMPETENT THAN THE OVER 25 AND 40.

AS GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF PLANNING PRACTICE, EQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION GIS (PPGIS) IS CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION. UNFORTUNATELY, PEOPLE WITH RESTRICTED ACCESS TO COMPUTERS, LIMITED INTERNET SKILLS, AND POOR MAP LITERACY COULD FACE POTENTIAL EXCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE OLDER ADULTS' AGE GROUPS SHOW THE STRONGEST GROWTH AMONG INTERNET USERS, THEIR GENERAL INTERNET SKILLS REMAIN LIMITED COMPARED TO THOSE OF YOUNGER AGE GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, LITTLE PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON OLDER ADULTS' USAGE OF PPGIS, AS CURRENT STUDIES FOCUS MAINLY ON OLDER ADULTS' USE OF THE INTERNET IN GENERAL OR (PASSIVE) WEB MAPS IN PARTICULAR; PPGIS USABILITY STUDIES GENERALLY TARGET A WIDER AUDIENCE. IN THIS QUALITATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE STUDY, WE EXAMINE OLDER ADULTS' EXPERIENCE WITH A PPGIS SURVEY AND IMPLEMENT THE FINDINGS INTO A FINAL RESEARCH SURVEY DESIGN. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT PREVIOUS RESULTS FROM OTHER INTERNET OR WEB MAP USABILITY STUDIES WITH OLDER ADULTS WHILE, IN ADDITION, DISPLAYING SIMILARITIES TO THE OUTCOMES OF GENERAL PPGIS USABILITY STUDIES, ESPECIALLY REGARDING COGNITIVE ABILITIES. STUDYING OLDER ADULTS DRAWS ATTENTION TO A VULNERABLE BUT GROWING INTERNET USER GROUP.

ONLINE SERVICE USAGE IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE DISCOURSE OF THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"", AN EMBLEMATIC TERM FOR THE INEQUALITY OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THIS PAPER IS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF INTERNET AND FACEBOOK PENETRATION COUPLED WITH ECONOMIC STRENGTH (GDP/CAPITA), LITERACY AND DEGREE OF RURAL POPULATION. FINDINGS - THE FINDINGS REVEAL A HETEROGENEOUS PATTERN WITH A FEW AFRICAN COUNTRIES BEING DIGITAL OASES AND CLOSE TO EUROPEAN LEVELS, WHEREAS THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRIES ARE STILL DIGITAL DESERTS. A STRONG CORRELATION IS FOUND BETWEEN ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND INTERNET PENETRATION. A GENERALIST PICTURE THAT SUB-SAHARAN IS ON THE TRAJECTORY OF CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS AN IMPRECISE REFLECTION OF THE REALITY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - IT IS ARGUED THAT INSTEAD OF MEASURING SUPPLY-SIDE DATA, WHICH HAS BEEN THE TREND TILL NOW, THE USE OF DEMAND-SIDE ELEMENTS SUCH AS ONLINE SERVICE USAGE TELLS MORE ABOUT DIGITAL INEQUALITIES BETWEEN COUNTRIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE RESEARCH ENCOURAGES INTERNET FIRMS TO OPEN UP THEIR EYES FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AS AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY WITH AN UNTAPPED GAP OF ONLINE USAGE. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE THREE-BILLION INTERNET USERS ON THE PLANET ARE UNEVENLY SPREAD AND UNDER-REPRESENTED IN AFRICA. BY DRAWING A HETEROGENEOUS ONLINE USAGE LANDSCAPE, DIGITAL POLICY CAN BE ACCURATELY STEERED TOWARD COUNTRIES WITH THE LARGEST NEEDS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THERE IS A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH GOING INTO THE DEPTH OF ONLINE USAGE IN AFRICA. THE PAPER IS A CONTRIBUTION TO FILL THAT GAP.","UNIV GOTHENBURG, SCH BUSINESS ECON & LAW, CTR INT BUSINESS STUDIES, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.","WENTRUP, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GOTHENBURG, SCH BUSINESS ECON & LAW, CTR INT BUSINESS STUDIES, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.","AOYAMA Y, 2011; BASU K, 1998, DOI 10.1111/1468-0297.00369; BRYNJOLFSSON E, 2000, DOI 10.1257/jep.14.4.23; BURELL J, 2012; CAIRNCROSS F, 2001; CASTELLS M, 2002; CHENEAU-LOQUAY A, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10708-007-9053-4; COBBINAH P, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2015.03.013; DE BEER C, 2007, DOI 10.1080/02500160701685482; DICKEN P, 2011; ECONOMOU P, 2008; FINK C, 2003, DOI 10.1108/14636690310507180; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; GEBREMICHAEL M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.02.011; GILBERT M, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.08.001; GRAHAM M, 2013, DOI 10.1111/geoj.12009; GRAHAM M, 2013, DOI 10.1068/a45349; GRAHAM M, 2012, DOI 10.1068/a44497; GRAHAM M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/146499341001100303; GRAHAM M, 2011, DOI 10.1080/10630732.2011.578412; GRAHAM S, 2002, DOI 10.1080/00420980220099050; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HAWELKA B, 2014, DOI 10.1080/15230406.2014.890072; HILBERT M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019; HINSON R, 2006, DOI 10.1108/14684520610659166; JAMES J, 2008, DOI 10.1002/asi.20793; JAMES J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2011.08.010; LEAMER E, 2001, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.84909988; LEETARU K, 2014; ARROYO-BARRIGUETE J, 2010, DOI 10.1080/02642060802253850; MCKINSEY, 2013; MONTAGNIER P, 2011; MUTULA S, 2007; MWESIGE P G, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0736-5853(03)00024-8; NEILSON J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/09692290.2013.873369; OECD, 2001; OECD, 2012; OYELARAN-OYEYINKA B, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.05.002; ROLLER L, 2001, DOI 10.1257/aer.91.4.909; ROYCROFT T, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00091-5; RUSTEN G, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9663.2009.00584.x; SEN A, 1992; SINGER H, 1970, DOI 10.1080/00220387008421348; SONAIKE S A, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0016549204039941; STATISTICA, 2014; THE WORLD B, 2021; TUROK I, 2014, DOI 10.1080/0376835x.2014.937524; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WALKER R, 1981; WANG C, 2011; WARF B, 2001, DOI 10.1068/b2691; WARF B, 2013; WARF B, 2001; WILSON E, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00097-6; WILSON III E J, 2006; WORLD B, 2014; WORLD B, 2013; WORLD B, 2014; WORLD ECONOMIC F, 2014; ZOOK M, 2002, DOI 10.1093/jeg/2.2.151",7,2016,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000382561000005,ISI,UNIV GOTHENBURG,UNIV GOTHENBURG,NA,"WENTRUP R, 2016, J SCI TECHNOL POLICY MANAG","WENTRUP R, 2016, J SCI TECHNOL POLICY MANAG",SWEDEN,10.1108/jstpm-03-2015-0013,NA,MANAGEMENT,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,NA,WOS

TECHNOL.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL INCLUSION; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; OLDER PEOPLE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; LEARNING AND SUPPORT; ICT,INFORMATION; TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; ADULTS,"THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE KEY ROLE OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL SOCIAL SUPPORT IN REDUCING DIGITAL INEQUALITIES BY ENABLING THE DIGITAL PARTICIPATION OF OLDER PEOPLE. IT IS BASED PRIMARILY ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON THE SUSTAINING IT USE BY OLDER PEOPLE TO PROMOTE AUTONOMY AND INDEPENDENCE (SUS-IT) PROJECT IN THE UK OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD WORKING WITH OVER 1,000 OLDER PEOPLE USING MIXED RESEARCH METHODS WITHIN A PARTICIPATIVE FRAMEWORK. IT IS FURTHER INFORMED BY OTHER STUDIES. THE RICH, MULTI-FACETED EVIDENCE REVEALS ON THE ONE HAND THE EXTENSIVE LEARNING AND SUPPORT NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS OF OLDER USERS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) AND, ON THE OTHER, THE DEARTH OF RELIABLE AND ONGOING SUPPORT PROVISION. ICT LEARNING AND SUPPORT IN THE UK RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE GOODWILL OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS IN COMMUNITY VENUES, SUCH AS PUBLIC LIBRARIES. ARRANGEMENTS ARE OFTEN AD HOC AND VARIABLE IN QUALITY AND RELIABILITY. IN A FACILITATED WORKSHOP, THE LEARNING AND ICT SUPPORT NEEDS OF OLDER PEOPLE AND THEIR PREFERRED FORMS OF PROVISION WERE DOCUMENTED AND DELIBERATED. THIS GENERATED A CLEAR SET OF USER REQUIREMENTS. TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS A PROPOSITION FOR COMMUNITY-BASED ICT SUPPORT PROVISION HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND REFINED. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSITION WHICH OFFERS A POWERFUL WAY TO REDUCE THE WIDESPREAD DIGITAL INEQUALITIES AMONG OLDER PEOPLE.","UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH, EPINAL WAY, LOUGHBOROUGH LE11 3TU, LEICS, ENGLAND.;  NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, SCH SOCIAL SCI, DIV SOCIOL, GOLDSMITH ST, NOTTINGHAM NG1 5LT, ENGLAND.","SANDHU, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, SCH SOCIAL SCI, DIV SOCIOL, GOLDSMITH ST, NOTTINGHAM NG1 5LT, ENGLAND.","BLAKE M, 2004; CANDY P C, 2004; DAMODARAN L, 2014, DOI 10.1159/000357431; DAMODARAN L, 2012; DAMODARAN L, 2013; DICKINSON A, 2007; DIGITAL INCLUSION P, 2004; DUTTON W H, 2011; ECHT K, 2002; EMMANOUILIDES C, 2000, DOI 10.1002/(sici)1520-6653(200021)14:2<17::aid-dir2>3.0.c0e; GOODMAN J, 2003; GORARD S, 2005, DOI 10.1080/0142569042000292725; HAWTHORN R, 2008; HSIEH H, 2005, DOI 10.1177/1049732305276687; JESSELL J, 2009; KATZ J, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00013-5; KENNER C, 2008, DOI 10.2167/le774.0; KT-EQUAL, 2012; MAYHORN C B, 2004; MCPAKE J, 2005; MEYER B, 2002, DOI 10.1037//0022-0663.94.3.486; OFCOM, 2009; OLPHERT W, 2013, DOI 10.1159/000353630; PURDIE N, 2003, DOI 10.1080/713844281; RAMONDT L, 2013; SANDHU J, 2013; SAYAGO S, 2009; SCHIEBER F, 2003; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1080/1369118032000155285; VIROKANNAS H, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0169-8141(99)00034-7; WELLMAN B, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1089107.1089137; WILLIAMSON K, 1997; WIYONO A, 2004; XIE B, 2007, DOI 10.1080/03601270701252872; YOUNG W, 2012",14,2016,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000379090600005,ISI,UNIV LOUGHBOROUGH;NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV,NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV,NA,"DAMODARAN L, 2016, INT J LEARN TECHNOL","DAMODARAN L, 2016, INT J LEARN TECHNOL",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1504/ijlt.2016.077520,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,14,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,UK RESEARCH COUNCIL AHRC [RES-353-25-0008]; UK RESEARCH COUNCIL BBSRC [RES-353-25-0008]; UK RESEARCH COUNCIL EPSRC [RES-353-25-0008]; UK RESEARCH COUNCIL ESRC [RES-353-25-0008]; UK RESEARCH COUNCIL MRC [RES-353-25-0008]; EPSRC [EP/G030898/2],WOS

DATA COLLECTION WAS CONDUCTED VIA QUESTIONNAIRE BASED ON A FIVE-POINT LIKERT SCALE. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE SECTIONS: COMPUTER USE; LOCATION AND FREQUENCY OF USE OF THE DEVICE; AND LAPTOP FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT ""PLURIMODALICTS"" USE THEIR LAPTOPS TO PRODUCE ACADEMIC WORK, AS WELL AS FOR EXCHANGING CLASS NOTES AND SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION. THE DISTANCE OR DIRECT LEARNING METHODOLOGY AND THE RESPONDENT'S GENDER ALSO DETERMINE LAPTOP USE FOR ACADEMIC TASKS, WHICH IS GREATER AT DISTANCE LEARNING INSTITUTIONS AND IS MORE PREVALENT AMONG WOMEN THAN MEN. THESE DEVICES ARE MAINLY USED AT HOME AND, IN THE CASE OF THE YOUNGER RESPONDENTS, ALSO IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES.

THIS SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW ELUCIDATES THE FACTORS UNDERLYING THE CONCEPTS OF ""DIGITAL EXCLUSION"" AND THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" IN HIGHER EDUCATION. THE IDENTIFIED FACTORS ARE GROUPED INTO THREE CATEGORIES: SOCIAL EXCLUSION (I.E., LOW INCOME, ICT-AVOIDANCE AS THE NORM, LACK OF MOTIVATION AND COMMITMENT, AND PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY), DIGITAL EXCLUSION (I.E., LACK OF HARDWARE DEVICES AND INTERNET SERVICES) AND ACCESSIBILITY (WHICH INCLUDE THE DIVISION BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS, AS WELL AS DISPARITIES IN ICT LITERACY AND INFORMATION LITERACY). THESE FACTORS ARE MULTI-TIERED AND OVERLAPPING. STUDIES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, DIGITAL EXCLUSION, AND BARRIERS TO ICT ADOPTION IN HIGHER EDUCATION DEAL WITH SIMILAR FACTORS, BUT THESE ARE EXPERIENCED DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.

THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR STUDYING NUANCED ADOPTION BEHAVIOURS THAT DEFINE A DIGITAL DIVIDE. LARGE-SCALE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHAT BEHAVIOURS EXIST IN SUCH POPULATIONS, BUT CAN OFFER LIMITED ABILITY TO DRAW INFERENCES ABOUT WHY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO REPORT A LARGE-SCALE STUDY INSIDE CHINA THAT PROBES A NUANCED ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" BEHAVIOUR: CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS INDICATING ABILITY TO PAY BY ELECTRONIC MEANS BUT BEHAVIOUR SUGGESTING LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO DO SO, AND EXTENDS CURRENT DEMOGRAPHICS TO HELP EXPLAIN THIS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS REPORT TRANS-NATIONAL ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL ""BIG DATA"" INSIDE CHINA CAPTURING THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMPTION OF MILLIONS OF CONSUMERS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL MARKET CHANNELS. FOCUSING ON ONE URBAN LOCATION WE COMBINE TRADITIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS WITH A NEW MEASURE THAT REFLECTING MIGRATION: ""DISTANCE FROM HOME"", AND USE DATA-MINING TECHNIQUES TO DEVELOP A MODEL THAT PREDICTS USE BEHAVIOUR. FINDINGS - USE BEHAVIOUR IS PREDICTABLE. MOST USE IS EXPLAINED BY VALUE OF THE TRANSACTION. ""DISTANCE FROM HOME"" IS MORE PREDICTIVE OF TECHNOLOGY USE THAN TRADITIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - RESULTS SUGGEST TRADITIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN ""WHY"" USE/NON-USE OCCURS AND HENCE AN INSUFFICIENT BASIS TO FORMULATE AND TARGET GOVERNMENT POLICY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE AUTHORS UNDERSTAND THIS TO BE THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE TRANS-NATIONAL STUDY OF USE/NON-USE OF DIGITAL CHANNELS WITHIN CHINA, AND THE FIRST STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF DISTANCE ON ICT ADOPTION.","UNIV EDINBURGH, SCH BUSINESS, EDINBURGH, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.;  UNIV EDINBURGH, EPCC, EDINBURGH, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.","LLOYD, AD (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV EDINBURGH, SCH BUSINESS, EDINBURGH, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.","AKKAS E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.cageo.2015.03.015; ALIPAY, 2013; ANDERSON C, 2008; ARRINGTON M, 2009; ATSMON Y, 2012; BACH A, 2013, DOI 10.5325/jinfopoli.3.2013.0247; BANKERT R, 2007, DOI 10.1175/waf1035.1; BASTI E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2015.02.011; BEKAERT G, 2012; BOLLARD A, 2014; BROWN R, 1995; BURNS D, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10869-007-9037-x; CASTELLS M, 2009; CHAN K, 2008, DOI 10.1017/s0305741008000787; CHATZIS S, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2012.01.053; CHEN F, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.econmod.2014.12.035; CHEN J, 2014; CHEN Y, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0269094211409118; CHIANG W, 2012, DOI 10.1002/jtr.840; CHOI N, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2645; CHU C, 2014, DOI 10.1155/2014/634123; COMAROFF J, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01273.x; COUGHLAN A, 1985, DOI 10.1287/mksc.4.2.110; CUSHMAN M, 2008, DOI 10.1108/09593840810895993; DAY P, 2013; EARMAN J, 1999, DOI 10.1023/a:1005106917477; EMERSON D, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2008.11.007; EUBANKS V, 2011; EVANS J, 2000, DOI 10.1108/02651330010339905; EVANS J, 2002, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8491029; FORMAN C, 2002; FRY J, 2009; GARTNER A, 1974; GILCHRIST J, 2011; GORT M, 1982, DOI 10.2307/2232554; GRAY J, 2009; GUPTA R, 2010, DOI 10.1124/dmd.110.034918; HAKANSON L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.intman.2010.06.001; HALEY G, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0019-8501(01)00183-3; HAMMERSLEY M, 2006, DOI 10.1080/17457820500512697; HAYES H B, 1996; HAYS C, 2004; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; HIPP J, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6040.2009.01267.x; HOFFMAN D L, 2000; HU F, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chieco.2010.09.007; HUBER M, 1976; HUME D, 1739; JEYARAJ A, 2006, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000056; JOHANSON J, 1977, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490676; KHARE A, 2012, DOI 10.1108/13555851211218048; KINCAID H, 1996; KOHAVI R, 2002; KONTOS E, 2014, DOI 10.2196/jmir.3117; KRONMILLER G, 1966; LIGHT J, 2001, DOI 10.17763/haer.71.4.342x36742j2w4q82; LLOYD A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2012.12.013; MACFIE N, 2008; MARTON K, 1991, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9701.1991.tb00496.x; MCCONNAUGHEY J W, 1998; MILLER T, 2013; MOK D, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0042098010377363; NASDAQ, 2014; NBSC, 2012; NORRIS P, 2001; OFCOM, 2012; ORACLE, 2014; PARSONS R, 2014; PARSONS T, 1991; PASHLER H, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1745691612463401; POWER D J, 2002; PRAHALAD C, 2000; QIU J, 2009; QUINLAN J, 1989, DOI 10.1016/0890-5401(89)90010-2; RANGE, 2013; RISSANEN J, 1978, DOI 10.1016/0005-1098(78)90005-5; RITZER G, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1469540514553717; RULEQUEST R, 2012; SANGA S, 2009, DOI 10.1186/1755-8794-2-59; SCHATZ B, 1994, DOI 10.1126/science.265.5174.895; SHAO C, 2015, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btv043; SHIH G, 2014; SOLOW R, 1987; SON C, 2012, DOI 10.1186/1472-6947-12-17; SONG X, 2014, DOI 10.1002/for.2294; STOTTINGER B, 2000, DOI 10.1108/02651330010322723; TEECE D, 1993; THE WORLD B, 2015; TOFFLER A, 1980; UNITED N, 2012; VAHLNE J, 1973; VERDEGEM P, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.009; WANG J, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0276146713508137; WARSCHAUER M, 2010; WAVE, 2013; WEE W, 2012; WORLD B, 2014; WORTHINGTON S, 2007, DOI 10.1108/02652320710754024; WU X, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10115-007-0114-2; XIA J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2008.07.006; YEE-KWONG CHAN R, 1997; YINGQIN Z, 2008, DOI 10.1108/09593840810896000; ZEGARRA E F, 2011; ZHU S, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0266666912450168",5,2016,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000379781900001,ISI,UNIV EDINBURGH;UNIV EDINBURGH,UNIV EDINBURGH,NA,"LLOYD AD, 2016, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE","LLOYD AD, 2016, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/itp-10-2014-0243,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"UK ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [RES-149-25-0005, RES-189-25-0039]; UK EPSRC [EP/H006753/1]; SCOTTISH FUNDING COUNCIL (EDIKT2 GRANT) [HR04019]; AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL; SINGAPORE TELECOM [LP0454322, SR0567388]; EPSRC [EP/H006753/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ESRC [ES/H021787/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [ES/H021787/1] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH; ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL [EP/H006753/1] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH",WOS

HOWEVER, DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR OVERSIMPLIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND INTERNET USE AND FOR ITS UNDER-THEORIZATION. A SOCIAL MILIEU APPROACH, INSPIRED BY PIERRE BOURDIEU'S SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY, PRESENTS AN EXCELLENT SET OF CONCEPTS TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICISMS AND THUS ADVANCE DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH. THIS ARTICLE USES THE SOCIAL MILIEU APPROACH FOR AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PARTICIPATION DIVIDES IN GERMANY. FOCUS GROUPS AND ONLINE COMMUNITIES WITH 96 PARTICIPANTS FROM SEVEN DISTINCT INTERNET MILIEUS SERVE TO DIFFERENTIATE ONLINE PARTICIPATION ALONG SOCIAL LINES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT GERMAN CITIZENS ARE STRONGLY SEGREGATED INTO DISTINCT INTERNET MILIEUS THAT DIFFER IN THEIR INTENSITY, VARIETY, UNDERSTANDING, AND ATTITUDES TOWARD ONLINE PARTICIPATION.

BRITISH TWITTER USERS ARE YOUNGER, WEALTHIER, AND BETTER EDUCATED THAN OTHER INTERNET USERS, WHO IN TURN ARE YOUNGER, WEALTHIER, AND BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE OFF-LINE BRITISH POPULATION. AMERICAN TWITTER USERS ARE ALSO YOUNGER AND WEALTHIER THAN THE REST OF THE POPULATION, BUT THEY ARE NOT BETTER EDUCATED. TWITTER USERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY MEMBERS OF ELITES IN BOTH COUNTRIES. TWITTER USERS ALSO DIFFER FROM OTHER GROUPS IN THEIR ONLINE ACTIVITIES AND THEIR ATTITUDES. THESE BIASES AND DIFFERENCES HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH BASED ON TWITTER DATA. THE UNREPRESENTATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF TWITTER USERS SUGGEST THAT TWITTER DATA ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR RESEARCH WHERE REPRESENTATIVENESS IS IMPORTANT, SUCH AS FORECASTING ELECTIONS OR GAINING INSIGHT INTO ATTITUDES, SENTIMENTS, OR ACTIVITIES OF LARGE POPULATIONS. IN GENERAL, TWITTER DATA SEEM TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR CORPORATE USE THAN FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH.","UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, 1 ST GILES, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","BLANK, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, 1 ST GILES, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","ASUR S, 2010, DOI 10.1109/wi-iat.2010.63; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOYD D, 2012, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.678878; BRUNS A, 2014, DOI 10.1108/ajim-02-2014-0027; CHANG J, 2010; DUBOIS E, 2013; DUGGAN M, 2013; DUGGAN M, 2014; DUTTON W, 2013; DUTTON W H, 2011; FRICK T, 2014; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0002716215570866; HARGITTAI E, 2012, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.666256; HENNIG-THURAU T, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11747-014-0388-3; HOUSLEY W, 2013, DOI 10.1080/13645579.2013.774164; HUBERTY M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2014.08.005; KALAMPOKIS E, 2013, DOI 10.1108/intr-06-2012-0114; KOH Y, 2014; LEETARU K, 2013, DOI 10.5210/fm.v18i5.4366; MICHAEL J, 2007; MISLOVE A, 2011; MORSTATTER F, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-05579-4_10; MUSTAFARAJ E, 2011, DOI 10.1109/passat/socialcom.2011.188; PENNACCHIOTTI M, 2011, DOI 10.1145/2020408.2020477; PEW RESEARCH C, 2013; PEW RESEARCH C, 2014; RAO D, 2010, DOI 10.1145/1871985.1871993; SLOAN L, 2015, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0115545; SLOAN L, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.3001; STURGIS P, 2016; TUFEKCI Z, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WELLS T, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12058; WILKINSON D, 2012, DOI 10.1002/asi.22713; WILLIAMS S, 2013, DOI 10.1108/jd-03-2012-0027; ZALLER J, 1992",86,2017,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000414803600001,ISI,UNIV OXFORD,UNIV OXFORD,NA,"BLANK G, 2017, SOC SCI COMPUT REV","BLANK G, 2017, SOC SCI COMPUT REV",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/0894439316671698,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",87,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,NA,WOS

NONETHELESS, ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS UTILITIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTED TO NGA DIFFUSION IN MANY COUNTRIES. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, SEVERAL SMALL-SCALE INITIATIVES HAVE EMERGED IN THE UK, BRINGING FIBRE NETWORKS TO URBAN AND RURAL AREAS PREVIOUSLY OVERLOOKED BY EITHER COMMERCIAL OR SUBSIDISED DEPLOYMENTS. A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY APPROACH IS EMPLOYED HERE TO EXPLORE THE NATURE AND THE DRIVERS OF NICHE PROVIDERS IN THE UK NGA MARKET.

FIVE DIFFERENT TEST STUDY CASES ARE PRESENTED, FOUR IN SLOVENIA AND ONE IN AUSTRIA, EACH WITH DIFFERENT SPECIFIC TARGET USER GROUPS AND THEIR OWN DYNAMICS. ACCORDING TO THE PROJECT DISPOSITION GOALS THE FOCUS WAS ON THE ELDERLY. METHODS, SUCH AS THINK-ALOUD PROTOCOL IN COMBINATION WITH A GUIDED INTERVIEW AND OBSERVATION OF VERBAL AS WELL AS OF NON-VERBAL RESPONSES, WERE USED. TO ENSURE THE REPEATABILITY OF TESTS AND TO HELP GUIDE THE PROCESS, A SPECIAL QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED. THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON: THE NAVIGATION AND INTERACTION CONCEPT, THE CONTENT, THE READABILITY, AND THE OVERALL ACCEPTANCE AND THE PERCEPTION OF VALUE OF THE TV-WEB SERVICE. MORE THAN 74 USERS PARTICIPATED IN THE USER EXPERIENCE STUDIES, 27 OF THEM 65 YEARS OLD OR OLDER. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PRESENTED NAVIGATION AND INTERACTION CONCEPT IS INDEED INTUITIVE AND SIMPLE ENOUGH TO BE USED BY MOST USERS WITH NO OR LITTLE EFFORT.

THIS MEASURE WAS THEN USED AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE IN AN OLS MODEL THAT ALLOWS NON-LINEAR EFFECTS, WITH THE GDP PER CAPITA OF COUNTRIES AS THE EXPLANATORY VARIABLE. OUR FINDINGS ARE SUBSTANTIVE IN THAT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT WAS FOUND TO BE NOT LINEAR, BEING MUCH STRONGER IN POORER COUNTRIES, A FINDING NOT COMMONLY SEEN IN THE LITERATURE. AS A RESULT, FUTURE STUDIES THAT FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM OUR FINDINGS, BY POSTULATING THIS TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. IN OUR MODEL WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLAIN 83 % OF THE VARIATION IN THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRIES, COMPARED TO JUST 72 % IF CONSIDERING ONLY A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP.","NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH, LISBON, PORTUGAL.;  BRUNEL UNIV, BRUNEL BUSINESS SCH, UXBRIDGE, MIDDX, ENGLAND.","CRUZ-JESUS, F (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH, LISBON, PORTUGAL.","ASHRAF M, 2007; ASHRAF M, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9133-0; AYRES R, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2003.11.001; BAKKER A, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s1386-5056(02)00036-9; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2010; BEILOCK R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3; BERTOT J, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4; BILLON M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/09654310701748009; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.006; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00461.x; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BROOKS S, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.serrev.2005.09.002; BRUNO G, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2010.534364; CARLSSON B, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.strueco.2004.02.001; CARTER L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x; CASTELLS M, 2002; CASTELLS M, 2007; CHANG S, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s10796-011-9297-x; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; CHINN M, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9396.2009.00861.x; CHOI Y, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.01.003; CILAN C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.11.002; CRENSHAW E, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00376.x; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; CUKUSIC M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.02.017; DOONG S, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2012.02.002; DRAGULANESCU N, 2002, DOI 10.1006/iilr.2002.0190; DWIVEDI Y, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1435417.1435445; EMROUZNEJAD A, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2010.04.002; EUROPEAN C, 2010; EUROPEAN C, 2006; EUROPEAN C, 2013; EUROPEAN C, 2010; FACER N S K, 2007; FORMAN C, 2005, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1040.0343; GOMEZ R, 2009, DOI 10.1108/14678040910949675; GRIPENBERG P, 2011, DOI 10.1108/09593841111158392; GUILLEN M, 2005, DOI 10.1353/sof.2006.0015; GURSTEIN M, 2003; HAIR J, 1995; HAIR J, 2014; HARGITTAI E, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6; HATAKKA M, 2013, DOI 10.1108/09593841311307169; HSIEH J, 2008; INDJIKIAN R, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.004; JALAVA J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.eeh.2007.11.001; JAMES J, 2007, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000097; KATZ J, 1997, DOI 10.1108/10662249710171814; KAUFFMAN R, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00073; KIISKI S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3; KIM D, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s10796-010-9267-8; KLASEN S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.11.003; KRAEMAR K, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00071; KRISHNAN S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.07.055; KURIYAN R, 2008, DOI 10.1080/01972240701883948; LEE S, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2004.11.005; MA J, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10796-014-9485-6; MIDDLETON K, 2010, DOI 10.1108/09593841011022528; MO D, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.12.019; NETER J, 1974; NIEHAVES B, 2014, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2013.19; NISHIDA T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.05.004; NUNNALY J, 1978; OECD, 2009; OECD, 2001; OECD, 2011; OECD, 2004; OKAZAKI S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2005.05.001; ONI O, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10796-012-9384-7; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PENG G, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2011.01.004; RICHARDSON H, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9137-9; RIGGINS F, 2005; ROBISON K, 2002; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; VICENTE M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2009.12.006; VICENTE M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01615440903423245; VICENTE M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/13504850701719686; SCIADAS G, 2005; SEY A, 2008; SHAPIRO S S, 1965; SHARMA S, 1996; TENGTRAKUL P, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.01.002; US DEPARTMENT OF C, 1999; UNESCO I F S, 2003; UNWIN T, 2009, DOI 10.1016/b978-008044910-4.00090-0; US DEP C, 1998; US DEP C, 2002; US DEPARTMENT OF C, 2000; US DEPARTMENT OF C, 1995; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; VENKATESH A, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9097-0; VENKATESH V, 2012; CUERVO M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2006.05.001; VICENTE M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13504850600972352; VICENTE M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2006.03.039; VISHWANATH A, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10796-014-9509-2; WANG Y, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.07.001; WARSCHAUER M, 2002; WHITE H, 1980; WOLCOTT P, 2001; WORLD B, 2006; WSIS, 2003; WSIS, 2005; ZHANG X, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9099-y; ZHANG X, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.12.011; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1108/itp-01-2013-0022; ZHAO F, 2012, DOI 10.1108/09593841211278794; ZHAO H, 2007, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2007040102",48,2017,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000406184200011,ISI,NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH;BRUNEL UNIV,NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH,NA,"CRUZ-JESUS F, 2017, INF SYST FRONT","CRUZ-JESUS F, 2017, INF SYST FRONT",UNITED KINGDOM;PORTUGAL,10.1007/s10796-016-9634-1,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS",48,SPRINGER,NA,WOS

DIGITAL READING IS NOT AN END IN ITSELF; IT IS A TOOL THAT A USER SELECTS, DEPENDING ON THE DESIRED PURPOSE AND USES IT IN SPECIFIC CONTEXTS. ADOLESCENTS ACCESS INTERNET WITH AT LEAST FOUR PURPOSES: ACADEMIC, RECREATIONAL, SOCIALIZATION AND COMMUNICATION. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES SAID PURPOSES IN ADOLESCENTS FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND RELATES THEM TO THEIR READING LITERACY PROFICIENCY LEVEL IN TWO EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS: PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. THE SAMPLE GROUP INCLUDED 382 STUDENTS IN THEIR FOURTH YEAR OF SECONDARY SCHOOL (10TH GRADE). TWO INSTRUMENTS WERE USED: COLEP, BASED ON TEXTS FROM PISA, AND A SCALE TO MEASURE READING FREQUENCY, WHICH CLASSIFIES THE FOUR READING PURPOSES IN TWO FORMATS: PRINTED AND DIGITAL. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT MOST STUDENTS ACCESS AND USE THE INTERNET FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES, REGARDLESS OF THE EDUCATIONAL SECTOR. NEVERTHELESS, READING LITERACY PROFICIENCY DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY WITH STUDENTS FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS BEING IN LOWER LEVELS. THIS MINIMIZES THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SOCIAL SECTORS PRODUCING READING ILLITERATES THAT HAVE HIGH ECONOMIC COSTS FOR THE NATION.","CATHOLIC UNIV MADRE & MAESTRA, DEPT EDUC, SANTIAGO CABALLEROS, DOMINICAN REP.;  UNIV SEVILLE, FAC SCI EDUC, SEVILLE, SPAIN.","AMIAMA-ESPAILLAT, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV MADRE & MAESTRA, DEPT EDUC, SANTIAGO CABALLEROS, DOMINICAN REP.","BLAKEMORE S, 2011; BRAVO D, 2002; CASSANY D, 2012; CASSANY D, 2010, DOI 10.5007/2175-795x.2010v28n2p353; CEPAL, 2013; CERLALC, 2014; CERRILLO-TORREMOCHA P, 2007; CHOQUE-ALDANA M, 2009; COLAS-BRAVO P, 2013, DOI 10.3916/c40-2013-02-01; FERNANDEZ-CRUZ F, 2016, DOI 10.3916/c46-2016-10; JONES C, 2011; KALANTZIS M, 2016; KNOBEL M, 2010; KNOBEL M, 2011; KNOBEL M, 2014, DOI 10.1002/jaal.314; LANHAM R, 1995; LYNCH R G, 2015; MARCELO C, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-12; MCKENNA M, 2012; MCLUHAN M, 1964; MECD, 2010; MILLAN J A, 2000; MOJICA J P, 2011; NICHOLAS C, 2011; OECD, 2012, DOI 10.1787/9789264167872-en; OECD, 2002; OECD, 2010, DOI 10.1787/9789264083943-en.; OECD, 2000; OECD, 2005; OECD, 2016; OECD, 2016, DOI 10.1787/; PITCHER S, 2007; PLESTER B, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01483.x; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; SALINAS P, 1967; SCHLEICHER A, 2009; SLAVIN R, 2009, DOI 10.1080/19415530903043631; STANOVICH K, 1986, DOI 10.1598/rrq.21.4.1; UNESCO, 2016; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; WHITE DAVID S, 2011",16,2017,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000404590000010,ISI,CATHOLIC UNIV MADRE AND MAESTRA;UNIV SEVILLE,CATHOLIC UNIV MADRE AND MAESTRA,NA,"AMIAMA-ESPAILLAT C, 2017, COMUNICAR","AMIAMA-ESPAILLAT C, 2017, COMUNICAR",SPAIN,10.3916/c52-2017-10,NA,COMMUNICATION; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,17,GRUPO COMUNICAR,INAFOCAM-INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE FORMACION Y CAPACITACION DEL MAGISTERIO (NATIONAL TEACHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING); IDEICE-INSTITUTO DOMINICANO DE EVALUACION E INVESTIGACION DE LA CALIDAD EDUCATIVA (DOMINICAN INSTITUTE FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND RESEARCH OF QUALITY EDUCATION),WOS

HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN ITS MOST BASIC FORM (PHYSICAL ACCESS AND USE) IS CLOSING WITH RESPECT TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, A NEW, MORE COMPLEX DIGITAL DIVIDE IS MOVING FORWARD, AND IS RELATED TO THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF THE INTERNET. THIS STUDY, WHICH USED A RANDOM SAMPLE STRATIFIED BY PROVINCES AND WHICH COMPRISED 3754 RESPONDENTS REPRESENTING THE SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN ECUADOR, HAD AS OBJECTIVES: (A) TO VERIFY THE RELATIONSHIP AND SEQUENCE AMONG THE DIFFERENT LEVELS TO ACCESS THE INTERNET FOUND ON SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS; AND (B) TO VERIFY TO WHAT DEGREE THE STUDENT'S FAMILY STATUS INFLUENCED THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTERNET ACCESS. THROUGH THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF A STRUCTURAL MODEL, THE RESULTS SHOVVED A SEQUENCE BETWEEN THE RELATIONSHIPS FOUND AMONG THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTERNET ACCESS, AS WELL AS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE TECHNICAL RESOURCES AND LEVELS OF DIGITAL LITERACY ON THE ACADEMIC USE OF THE INTERNET.

OUR FINDINGS ALSO POINT TO A POSSIBLE CULTURAL FACTOR THAT PUTS CHINESE INTERNET USERS AT PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK.","UNIV HOHENHEIM, INST HLTH CARE & PUBL MANAGEMENT, D-70599 STUTTGART, GERMANY.;  BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV, CTR MULTIDISCIPLINARY RES AGING, DEPT COMMUN STUDIES, BEER SHEVA, ISRAEL.","NIE, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV HOHENHEIM, INST HLTH CARE & PUBL MANAGEMENT, D-70599 STUTTGART, GERMANY.","BAKKEN I, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9450.2008.00685.x; BESSIERE K, 2010, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1149; BLANCHFLOWER D, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.01.030; BROSNAN M, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(98)00024-7; CAMPBELL A, 2006, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2006.9.69; CAO H, 2011, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-11-802; COTTEN S, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.021; COTTEN S, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2011.00760.x; DAVIS F, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x; FORD G S, 2009; FORTSON B, 2007, DOI 10.3200/jach.56.2.137-146; FREY B, 2002, DOI 10.1257/002205102320161320; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; IGBARIA M, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0378-7206(95)00031-0; KATSAMANIS I, 2006; KAVETSOS G, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.joep.2011.05.004; KRAUT R, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1540-4560.00248; KROSS E, 2013, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0069841; LAM L, 2010, DOI 10.1001/archpediatrics.2010.159; LELKES O, 2013, DOI 10.1332/175982713x664047; LI N, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2005.01.007; MANNELL R, 2005, DOI 10.1080/07053436.2005.10707700; MENG Z, 2008; MORRISON C, 2010, DOI 10.1159/000277001; NEWELL J, 2008, DOI 10.1080/14241270802426600; NIMROD G, 2013; NOSSEK H, 2015; PENARD T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.08.004; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; QINGBIN W, 2012, DOI 10.5210/fm.v17i2.3767; REN Q, 2014; ROODMAN D, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1536867x1101100202; SABATINI F, 2014; SELFHOUT M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2008.10.011; SHAW L, 2002, DOI 10.1089/109493102753770552; SOUSA- POZA A, 1999; STEPANIKOVA I, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2009.11.002; TANDOC E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.053; TEO T, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0305-0483(98)00028-0; VALKENBURG P, 2007, DOI 10.1080/15213260709336802; WANG J, 2011, DOI 10.4236/psych.2011.24056; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WICKRAMASINGHE C N, 2013; WOETZEL J, 2014; WU X, 2013, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0061782; XIAO H, 2009; XIE Y, 2014; XIE Y, 2012",32,2017,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000402092900024,ISI,UNIV HOHENHEIM;BEN GURION UNIV NEGEV,UNIV HOHENHEIM,NA,"NIE P, 2017, SOC INDIC RES","NIE P, 2017, SOC INDIC RES",GERMANY;ISRAEL,10.1007/s11205-015-1227-8,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY; SOCIOLOGY",32,SPRINGER,"PROJECT, ""TUSCANY: A GLOBAL LABORATORY FOR QUALITY OF LIFE"" [2014/3014/8.4.1/30, 135 DEL 28/04/2014, 325 DEL 15/12/2014]; FOOD SECURITY CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM PART OF THE DAAD (GERMAN ACADEMIC EXCHANGE SERVICE) PROGRAM ""EXCEED""; DAAD; GERMAN FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (BMZ)",WOS

FURTHERMORE, ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENTS HAVE OFTEN SEEN E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES AS ONE MEANS OF ERODING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, PRIOR RESEARCH INTO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE E-GOVERNMENT CONTEXT IS LIMITED. HENCE, THIS RESEARCH SEEKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS IT AFFECTS NIGERIAN CITIZENS, SPECIFICALLY USERS OF THE NIGERIA IMMIGRATION SERVICE (NIS) WEB PORTAL. THE NIS PORTAL IS A RICH CONTEXT IN WHICH TO STUDY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: IT IS THE MOST WELL-DEVELOPED E-GOVERNMENT SERVICE IN NIGERIA; ITS USE IS COMPULSORY FOR CITIZENS SEEKING TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF NIGERIA; AND, ITS USERS RESIDE WITHIN BOTH NIGERIA (A DEVELOPING COUNTRY) AND IN MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE US AND THE UK. USING AN ONLINE SURVEY, AND SNOWBALL SAMPLING, 351 COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYSED USING T-TESTS AND ANOVA. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WAS REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF THE THREE DIMENSIONS: PREVIOUS INTERNET EXPERIENCE, ACCESS TO COMPUTING FACILITIES, AND PREVIOUS E-GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE. ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED A MULTI-DINTENSIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE WITH DEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIAL-ECONOMIC, AND LOCATIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING E-GOVERNMENT USERS' INTERNET EXPERIENCE, THEIR ACCESS TO COMPUTING FACILITIES AND THEIR E-GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE.

ICT INFRASTRUCTURES COULD STRONGLY HELP RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE MANY OPERATIONS ARE TIME CONSUMING, LABOR-INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE DUE TO LIMITED ACCESS AND LARGE DISTANCES TO COVER. ONE OF THE MOST ATTRACTIVE SOLUTIONS, WHICH IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS PROMISING FOR FILLING THIS GAP, IS THE USE OF DRONE FLEETS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A VIDEO MONITORING PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (VMPAAS) FOR WIDE RURAL AREAS NOT COVERED BY INTERNET ACCESS. THE PLATFORM IS REALIZED WITH A SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORK (SDN)/NETWORK FUNCTIONS VIRTUALIZATION (NFV)-BASED FLYING AD-HOC NETWORK (FANET), WHOSE TARGET IS PROVIDING A FLEXIBLE AND DYNAMIC CONNECTIVITY BACKBONE, AND A SET OF DRONES EQUIPPED WITH HIGH-RESOLUTION CAMERAS, EACH TRANSMITTING A VIDEO STREAM OF A PORTION OF THE CONSIDERED AREA. AFTER DESCRIBING THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE PROPOSED PLATFORM, SERVICE CHAINS TO REALIZE THE VIDEO DELIVERY SERVICE ARE DESCRIBED, AND AN ANALYTICAL MODEL IS DEFINED TO EVALUATE THE COMPUTATIONAL LOAD OF THE PLATFORM NODES IN SUCH A WAY SO AS TO ALLOW THE NETWORK ORCHESTRATOR TO DECIDE THE BACKBONE DRONES WHERE RUNNING THE VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS, AND THE RELATIVE RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED.

EDUC.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL INEQUALITY; DIGITAL NATIVES; INFORMATIONAL CAPITAL; CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS; PISA,DIVIDE,"THIS PAPER TESTS A THEORY OF SOCIAL USES OF THE INTERNET (LOPEZ-SINTAS, FILIMON, & GARCIA ALVAREZ, 2012), INSPIRED BY THE WORK OF BOURDIEU (1984, 1986, 1989), OUTSIDE THE SPANISH NATIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH IT WAS INITIALLY FORMULATED. USING THE OECD'S PISA 2012 DATA FOR GERMANY AND NORWAY, IT SPECIFICALLY SEEKS TO UNCOVER DIFFERENCES IN PATTERNS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES USAGE AMONG FIFTEEN-YEAR OLDS AND THE FACTORS STRUCTURING THOSE DIFFERENCES. SIMPLE CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS HAS BEEN USED AS THE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS SHOW SIMILARITIES BETWEEN USAGE SPACES IN GERMANY AND NORWAY; WHERE THE FIRST, DOMINANT DIMENSION REPRESENTS THE FREQUENCY OF DIGITAL USE AND THE SECONDARY DIMENSION REPRESENTS THE TYPE OF FREQUENT DIGITAL USE. FURTHERMORE, IN BOTH COUNTRIES GENDER, MIGRATION BACKGROUND, FAMILY STRUCTURE, THE PARENTS' LEVEL OF EDUCATION, MATERIAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AT HOME, AND THE NUMBER OF BOOKS AT HOME EXPLAIN NO MORE THAN 8.6 PERCENT OF THE VARIANCE IN DIGITAL USAGE. AT FACE VALUE, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE THEORY OF SOCIAL USES OF THE INTERNET SHOULD BE REJECTED WHEN APPLIED TO THE ADOLESCENTS IN THE COUNTRIES UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE PAPER ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE RESULTS SHOULD RATHER BE INTERPRETED AS AN INDIRECT CORROBORATION OF THE THEORY, WITH AGE BEING ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S SOCIAL STANDING AFFECTING DIGITAL USE.

POLICY,ARTICLE,INTERNATIONAL TRADE; BROADBAND; DATA SPEED; DIGITAL DIVIDE; GRAVITY MODEL; DEVELOPMENT,INFORMATION; GROWTH; CAPACITY; INTERNET; INFRASTRUCTURE; COMMUNICATE; STORE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS; PRODUCTIVITY; GOVERNANCE,"INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT GLOBAL TRADE PATTERNS THROUGH TRANSACTION COSTS ON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND SIDES. THE RELEVANT TRANSACTION COSTS ARE AFFECTED BY BOTH THE NUMBER OF TELECOMMUNICATION SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THE SPEED OF THE AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH. WE TEST FOR THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF TELECOMMUNICATION QUANTITY (DATA SUBSCRIPTIONS PER CAPITA) AND QUALITY (BANDWIDTH DATA SPEED PER SUBSCRIPTION) OF FIXED AND MOBILE TELEPHONY AND INTERNET SERVICES ON COUNTRIES' BILATERAL EXPORTS OF GOODS. WE USE AN AUGMENTED GRAVITY MODEL AND CONTROL FOR MULTILATERAL RESISTANCE. REGRESSION RESULTS FOR 122 COUNTRIES OVER 1995-2008 SHOW A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EXPORT PERFORMANCE OF BOTH VARIABLES. IN THE SUB-SAMPLE ANALYSIS WE FIND THAT DATA SPEED QUALITY IS WHAT MATTERS MOST FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHILE THE QUANTITY OF SUBSCRIPTIONS IS MORE RELEVANT FOR DEVELOPED ONES. WE EXPLAIN THIS BY THE DISADVANTAGE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DERIVE FROM BEING FAR FROM THE TECHNOLOGICAL COMMUNICATION FRONTIER IN TERMS OF DATA SPEED, WHILE THE DIFFUSION OF ADDITIONAL HIGH SPEED SUBSCRIPTIONS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES OPEN UP NEW MARKETS THERE. THIS ILLUSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF GOING BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL ASSESSMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND URGES BOTH SCHOLARS AND POLICY-MAKERS TO START CONSIDERING BANDWIDTH QUALITY.","UNIV GOTTINGEN, DEPT ECON, GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.;  UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT COMMUN, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.","ABELIANSKY, AL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GOTTINGEN, DEPT ECON, GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.","ACEMOGLU D, 2007, DOI 10.1162/qjec.2007.122.4.1759; AHMAD N A, 2011; ANDERSON J, 2003, DOI 10.1257/000282803321455214; BAIER S, 2010; BAIER S, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.jinteco.2006.02.005; BAIER S, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.jinteco.2008.10.004; BAKOS Y, 2001, DOI 10.1257/jep.15.1.69; BALDWIN R, 2007, DOI 10.11130/jei.2007.22.4.780; BAUER S, 2010; BEHRENS K, 2012, DOI 10.1002/jae.1231; BERDEN K, 2014, DOI 10.1111/twec.12135; BORENSTEIN S, 2001, DOI 10.1257/jep.15.1.3; BRESNAHAN T, 1986; BRYNJOLFSSON E, 1995, DOI 10.1080/10438599500000002; CAIRNCROSS F, 2001; CAMPOS N F, 2010; CARRERE C, 2010; CARRERE C, 2013, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6419.2011.00715.x; CASTELLS M, 2009; CHOI C, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2010.08.005; CLARKE G, 2006, DOI 10.1093/ei/cbj026; CROZET M, 2012, DOI 10.1093/restud/rdr030; DATTA A, 2004, DOI 10.1080/0003684042000218552; DE JONG E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2010.11.005; DE SOUSA J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2012.07.009; DEMIRKAN H, 2009; DIMELIS S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2010.03.004; DUGGAL V, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.jeconom.2006.07.010; EATON J, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0014-2921(01)00129-5; EATON J, 2012; EGGER P, 2014; EGGER P, 2011, DOI 10.1162/rest_a_00132; FINK C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jinteco.2004.09.006; FRANCOIS J, 2014, DOI 10.1111/twec.12141; FRANCOIS J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.02.009; FRANKEL J, 1997; FREUND C, 2002, DOI 10.1257/000282802320189320; FREUND C, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0022-1996(03)00059-x; GAULIER G, 2010; GLICK R, 2015; GRADEVA K, 2015; HARDY A, 1980, DOI 10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0; HEAD K, 2014, DOI 10.1016/b978-0-444-54314-1.00003-3; HILBERT M, 2016; HILBERT M, 2014, DOI 10.1002/asi.23031; HILBERT M, 2014, DOI 10.1002/asi.23020; HILBERT M, 2012; HILBERT M, 2012; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1126/science.1200970; HILBERT M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01972241003712199; HOFMAN A, 2016; JORGENSON D W, 2016; JORGENSON D, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0475.2007.00401.x; JORGENSON DALE W, 1995, DOI 10.1080/10438599500000008; KAUFMANN D, 2011, DOI 10.1017/s1876404511200046; LIU L, 2013, DOI 10.2753/ree1540-496x490605; MANNING W, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6296(01)00086-8; MARQUEZ-RAMOS L, 2012; MARQUEZ-RAMOS L, 2010; MARTINEZ-ZARZOSO I, 2013, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2011.599786; MATTES A, 2012; MAYER T, 2011, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1994531; MELITZ J, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jinteco.2014.04.004; MINGES M, 2005; OLINER S, 1994; PORTUGAL-PEREZ A, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2011.12.002; RAJABIUN R, 2015; RAUCH J, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0022-1996(98)00009-9; ROLLER L, 2001, DOI 10.1257/aer.91.4.909; ROSE A, 2000; ROSENBLAT T, 2004, DOI 10.1162/0033553041502199; SIEGEL D, 1992; SPIEZIA V, 2012, DOI 10.1787/eco_studies-2012-5k8xdhj4tv0t; TANG L, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2005.11.017; TIMMIS J, 2012; VAN ARK B, 2008, DOI 10.1257/jep.22.1.25; VEMURI V, 2009; VU K, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.02.008; WORLD TRADE O, 2013; YOO C S, 2014; ZWART B, 2015",36,2017,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000393719600004,ISI,UNIV GOTTINGEN;UNIV CALIF DAVIS,UNIV GOTTINGEN,NA,"ABELIANSKY AL, 2017, TELECOMMUN POLICY","ABELIANSKY AL, 2017, TELECOMMUN POLICY",GERMANY;USA,10.1016/j.telpol.2016.11.001,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,38,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,DFG,WOS

HOWEVER, DIGITAL DIVIDE THEORY SUGGESTS THAT TECHNOLOGY IN FACT EXACERBATES INEQUALITY. THIS STUDY REVIEWS THE ROLES THAT AFRICAN MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES (MOOCS) PLAY IN HELPING THE MOST MARGINALIZED TO IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES. THROUGH EVALUATING MOOCS CREATED BY WESTERN UNIVERSITIES, I ARGUE THAT WESTERN MOOCS ARE NOT ADAPTED TO NON-WESTERN CONTEXTS, AND ARE THUS UNSUCCESSFUL IN SUPPORTING AFRICAN EDUCATION. LITTLE RESEARCH EXISTS ON DESIGNING MOOCS FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. REFLECTING ON COLONIAL HISTORY, I DRAW PARALLELS BETWEEN THE COLONIZATION OF EDUCATION AND ""DIGITAL NEO-COLONIALISM"" THROUGH WESTERN MOOCS. BY THIS ANALOGY, I EXTEND DISCOURSE ON THE DECOLONIZATION OF EDUCATION, CURRENTLY CIRCULATING IN FORMAL TERTIARY INSTITUTES AROUND THE WORLD, TO INFORMAL ONLINE EDUCATION PLATFORMS. USING THE TRANSFORMATIVE PARADIGM AS MY EPISTEMOLOGY, I ANALYZE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF MOOCS TO SSA CONTEXTS THROUGH CONDUCTING A LITERATURE STUDY OF MOOCS CREATED IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN CONTEXTS, AIMED AT SERVING THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY, I AIM TO ANALYZE WHETHER THESE MOOCS ASSIST THE MOST MARGINALIZED TO FIND EMPLOYMENT AND IMPROVE THEIR CAPABILITIES. THE SIX AFRICAN MOOCS REVIEWED WERE CATEGORIZED BASED ON WHETHER THEY WERE: 1.) PART OF A DEGREE, OR A SINGLE MODULE; 2.) A PRIMARY SOURCE OF EDUCATION, OR SUPPLEMENTARY TO OTHER STUDIES; 3.) ""INWARDLY"" SERVING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, OR ""OUTWARDLY"" OPEN TO ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC; AND 4.) PARTNERED TO MEET INDUSTRY NEEDS, PARTNERED WITH EXISTING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES, OR INDEPENDENT. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE VARIOUS ISSUES RELEVANT TO SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN CONTEXTS, THE MOOCS WERE EVALUATED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: 1.) PURPOSE OF THE MOOC; 2.) MOOC PEDAGOGY; 3.) RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED; 4.) TYPES OF STUDENTS SUPPORTED; 5.) ACCREDITATION ACQUIRED; 6.) LOCALIZATION AND SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE; 7.) FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY; 8.) RELEVANCE TO EMPLOYMENT; AND 9.) OPENNESS. FROM ANALYSIS OF THESE MOOCS, I HYPOTHESIZE THE FRAMEWORK FOR A DECOLONIZED AFRICAN MOOC THROUGH MY "" BLENDED-LEARNING COMMUNITY MOOC MODEL"". I USE THE TPACK FRAMEWORK TO BREAK DOWN THE MODEL USING THREE LENSES: TECHNOLOGY, PEDAGOGY AND CONTENT. THE LITERATURE STUDY REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER IS ONE OF SIX PHASES IN MY RESEARCH METHODS. GOING FORWARD, MY MIXED RESEARCH METHODS INCLUDE ONLINE PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH MOOC DESIGNERS AND INDUSTRY, SURVEYS TO PAST, PRESENT AND POTENTIAL STUDENTS, AND DATABASE ANALYSIS OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF MOOC PARTICIPANTS. FINALLY, I PLAN TO RUN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL IN ORDER TO TEST THE "" BLENDED-LEARNING COMMUNITY MOOC MODEL"".","UNIV CAMBRIDGE, CTR DEV STUDIES, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND.","ADAM, T (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CAMBRIDGE, CTR DEV STUDIES, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND.","ADAM T, 2015; BILLSBERRY J, 2013; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2014; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2014; DACHI H, 2008; DEI G J S, 2010; GRAHAM M, 2015, DOI 10.1002/geo2.8; GRAHAM M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2014.910087; HASSLER B, 2015; KNOX J, 2015; KOP R, 2011, DOI 10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.882; LIYANAGUNAWARDENA T, 2013; MERTENS D, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1558689807302811; MILLIGAN C, 2013; PATRU M, 2016; POWELL S, 2013; READ T, 2015; ROHS M, 2015; SIEMENS G, 2005; TPACK, 2012; UNTERHALTER E, 2014; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227877; WARSCHAUER M, 2003",0,2017,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000427401303001,ISI,UNIV CAMBRIDGE,UNIV CAMBRIDGE,NA,"ADAM T, 2017, NA","ADAM T, 2017, NA",UNITED KINGDOM,978-84-617-8491-2,978-84-617-8491-2,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,NA,WOS

SCI.,ARTICLE,SOCIAL CAPITAL; CHILE; INFORMATION-SEEKING; SOCIAL MEDIA; DIGITAL DIVIDE; SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE,DIVIDE; CHOICE; SCHOOL,"PURPOSE - THIS PAPER AIMS TO REPORT THE FINDINGS FROM A SURVEY OF SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CHILE BY EXPLORING THEIR USE OF SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES FOR INFORMATION-SEEKING PURPOSES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - AN ONLINE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED VIA CHILE'S MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND 12,354 RESPONSES WERE RECEIVED. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE IN CHILE EXTENSIVELY USE SNSS, BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY USE THESE SERVICES, SPECIFICALLY FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES. WHEN CONSIDERING SCHOOL-RELATED ACTIVITIES, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF SNSS BY STUDENTS IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCHOOLS. THOSE IN ACADEMIC-FOCUSSED INSTITUTIONS ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE SNSS FOR SCHOOL-RELATED INFORMATION PURPOSES AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO PUBLISHMOST TYPES OF INFORMATION ON SNSS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - THE SAMPLE WAS SELF-SELECTING AND EXCLUDED STUDENTS WITHOUT ONLINE ACCESS TO THE SURVEY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS INDICATE MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN SCHOOLS SERVING LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT STUDENTS' USE OF SNSS FOR INFORMATION-SEEKING, ESPECIALLY FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SCHOOL-ASSOCIATED SOCIAL CAPITAL MAY HAVE A ROLE IN SHAPING STUDENTS' USE OF SNSS FOR INFORMATION AND LEARNING PURPOSES AND, POTENTIALLY, IN EXACERBATING DIGITAL INEQUALITIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - THE FOCUS ON THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA SPECIFICALLY FOR INFORMATION-SEEKING DISTINGUISHES THIS RESEARCH. THE FINDINGS CHALLENGE POSSIBLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LINKS BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND SOCIAL CLASS AND SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENCES MAY BE EXACERBATED BY SCHOOL PRACTICES.","MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIV, EDUC & SOCIAL RES INST, CREWE, ENGLAND.;  UNIV POITIERS, NATL CTR PEDAG DOCUMENTAT, POITIERS, FRANCE.","MCNICOL, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIV, EDUC & SOCIAL RES INST, CREWE, ENGLAND.","AILLERIE K, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0961000616631612; BELLIN I, 2013; BENTON F, 1998; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BOYD D, 2014; BURGESS S, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01442872.2011.601215; CHEN W, 2013, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2012.739265; CHOU W, 2009, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1249; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; CRESPO KARINA L, 2009; CROWLEY J, 2016; DAVIDSON J, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.701655; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1002/bem.20484; DIMAGGIO P, 2005; ELACQUA G, 2006, DOI 10.1002/pam.20192; FARIAS M, 2012; GOLDING P, 1996, DOI 10.14452/mr-048-03-1996-07_5; GRANT I, 2005, DOI 10.1362/0267257054307417; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-531-90519-8_7; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HINDMAN M S, 2009; JOIKO S, 2012; JONES R, 2016; KAPLAN A, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2009.09.003; LAMPS N, 2014; NORRIS P, 2001; NOTTEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1093/esr/jcn071; OCDE, 2010; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROGERS E, 1995; ROMÁN M, 2014, DOI 10.1590/s1517-97022014121528; SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM U, 2013; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SEGUIC J, 2011; STROVER S, 1999; VALENZUELA S, 2013; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; WACQUANT L, 2005; WE ARE S, 2014; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; WILLEMSE I, 2014; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",3,2017,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000427177000004,ISI,MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIV;UNIV POITIERS,MANCHESTER METROPOLITAN UNIV,NA,"MCNICOL S, 2017, INF LEARN SCI","MCNICOL S, 2017, INF LEARN SCI",UNITED KINGDOM;FRANCE,10.1108/ils-05-2017-0047,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,NA,WOS

THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICT AND PUPILS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS. OUR WORK AIMS TO VERIFY WHETHER ICT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO INCLUSIVE EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS MORE ISOLATED OF THE GLOBAL CONTEXT AND MINIMIZING SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES OF RURAL SCHOOLS OR, OTHERWISE WHETHER THESE CONTRIBUTE TO PERPETUATE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE SHOW BOTH SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS OF THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT OF CASTILE AND LEON WHERE THE STUDY IS CONTEXTUALIZED, AS THE BINOMIAL ICT-RURAL SCHOOL. METHOD. THIS RESEARCH IS BASED ON QUALITATIVE METHODOLOGY (36 PERSONAL INTERVIEWS AND 4 FOCUS GROUPS) WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY STUDIED: F/MOTHERS, TEACHERS, HEADTEACHERS, PRESIDENTS OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS' ASSOCIATION AND STUDENTS. RESULTS. THE DATA OBTAINED SHOW THAT STUDENTS IN RURAL SCHOOLS WOULD PERFORM AN EVEN GREATER USE OF ICT THAN THEIR URBAN COUNTERPARTS. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES REMAIN IN RURAL AREAS BETWEEN PREDOMINANTLY RURAL AREAS AND INTERMEDIATE RURAL AREAS. THEREFORE, THE GEOGRAPHIC GAP ADDS TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SOME OF THE MOST PREDOMINANTLY RURAL AREAS BUT NOT ALL, SHOWING THAT THERE IS STILL NO EQUAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR RURAL STUDENTS. THE MAIN VARIABLE WOULD BE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EACH TEACHER AND ICT. DISCUSSION. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS STILL PRESENT IN SOME RURAL AREAS AND THEIR SCHOOLS, DESPITE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EQUIPMENT IN RECENT YEARS. UNLIKE PREVIOUS LUSTRUMS, THE MAIN LINE OF INTERVENTION WOULD NOT FOCUS MUCH ON MATERIAL ASPECTS BUT THE TEACHER, WHICH WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MINIMIZE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, HEADING TOWARDS A MORE INCLUSIVE EDUCATION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR RURAL STUDENTS.","UNIV SALAMANCA, DEPT SOCIOL & COMUNICAC, SALAMANCA, SPAIN.","ROMO, NM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SALAMANCA, DEPT SOCIOL & COMUNICAC, FAC EDUC, PASEO CANALEJAS 169, E-37008 SALAMANCA, SPAIN.","ACEDO C, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11125-011-9198-2; AGUADED J I, 2010; ALONSO PEREZ M T, 2011; ANDREEA-DIANA S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.03.114; TORRES J, 2015, DOI 10.6018/reifop.18.1.214391; MOREIRA M, 2014; ARIAS P, 2005; BUSTOS A, 2009; CALLEJO J, 2002; RIOJA L, 2014, DOI 10.3989/ris.2012.12.27; CARVAJAL JIMENEZ V, 2008; CASTELLS M, 2014; CASTELLS M, 2016, DOI 10.1146/annurev-soc-081715-074158; COHEN D, 2007; CORBIN J, 1998; COSCOLIN S, 2010; DAN A, 2015, DOI 10.3109/09286586.2015.1056812; PEREZ M, 2014; DEMOUSSIS M, 2006, DOI 10.1080/10438590500216016; DUBET F, 2005; EDENSOR T, 2006; ELBOJ C, 2013; ESCOBAR ZAPATA F A, 2016; ESCRIBANO J, 2010; EUROPEAN C, 2011; TILVE M, 2009; GARCIA S, 2012; GATT S, 2012, DOI 10.4471/ijep.2012.09; GOMEZ S, 2013; GONZALEZ M R, 2005; GONZALEZ-GIL F, 2016, DOI 10.6018/reifop.19.3.219321; GORANSSON K, 2014, DOI 10.1080/08856257.2014.933545; GORDO GOMEZ P, 2011; HERNANDEZ R, 2009; KAY C, 2009; LAZARO M L R, 2010; MORALES N, 2016, DOI 10.14201/fjc201613169189; MORALES N, 2013, DOI 10.4422/ager.2012.03; MORALES N, 2010; ORTEGA J A, 2004; PEREZ A, 2003; QUINN T C, 2009; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SANTOS M A, 2004; SANZ B, 2011; SANZ B G, 2003; STECYL-I, 2012; TELLO I, 2014; TOMAS R B, 2015; TOMASEVSKI K, 2004; TORRES J, 2010, DOI 10.6018/reifop.18.1.214391; WOODS M, 2011",2,2017,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000426178700003,ISI,UNIV SALAMANCA,UNIV SALAMANCA,NA,"ROMO NM, 2017, BORDON","ROMO NM, 2017, BORDON",SPAIN,10.13042/bordon.2017.52401,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,2,"SOC ESPANOLA PEDAGOGIA, CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC",NA,WOS

SEVERAL SPECIALIZED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN ARE DESCRIBED. THE FIRST LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE IS UNDERSTOOD AS UNEQUAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AMONG DIFFERENT SOCIAL GROUPS; THE SECOND LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE MEANS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE PRACTICES OF USING THE INTERNET. EMPIRICALLY THE STUDY IS BASED ON TWO SURVEYS OF SCHOOLCHILDREN, CONDUCTED IN 2014-2016 IN ST. PETERSBURG (94 SCHOOLS, 3,739 PUPILS OF THE 10TH-11TH GRADES) AND THE KALUGA REGION (249 SCHOOLS, 27,904 PUPILS OF THE 6TH-9TH GRADES). THE RESULTS SHOW NO EVIDENCE OF THE FIRST LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE MEGALOPOLIS. IN THE KALUGA REGION, THE DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET ARE DUE TO THE TYPE OF SETTLEMENT (CITY-VILLAGE), THE FAMILY STRUCTURE (TWO-PARENT/SINGLE-PARENT FAMILIES), AND THE PARENTAL EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. SCHOOLCHILDREN LIVING IN A VILLAGE WITH A LESS EDUCATED SINGLE-PARENT ARE IN THE MOST VULNERABLE POSITION. NO DIFFERENCES IN INTERNET USE WERE FOUND BETWEEN SCHOOLCHILDREN REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAMILY BACKGROUND, SCHOOL TYPE, OR TYPE OF SETTLEMENT, NEITHER IN THE KALUGA REGION, NOR IN ST. PETERSBURG. MOST SCHOOLCHILDREN USE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES, AND THE INTENSITY OF USE INCREASES WITH AGE. THE MOST POPULAR GENERAL PURPOSE RESOURCE IS WIKIPEDIA; THE MOST POPULAR SPECIALIZED RESOURCE FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN IS ZNANIJA. COM.

THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE DEBATE ON THE WEIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL VARIABLES IN THIS MODEL. OUR THESIS IS THAT, AS THE INTERNET IS PENETRATING SOCIETY AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY POPULAR, PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS SUBJECTIVE BELIEFS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF TECHNOLOGY ARE GAINING PROMINENCE. BY CONTRAST, SOCIAL VARIABLES ARE BECOMING BETTER PREDICTORS OF INTERNET USE AS THEY ARE STIMULI AND INHIBITORS LEADING TO THE ADOPTION OF THIS BEHAVIOR. FOR THIS REASON, EMPIRICAL STUDIES REPEATEDLY SHOW WITH DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT TOOLS THAT THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES IS NOW LOWER THAN THAT OF SOCIAL VARIABLES. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEMONSTRATE THIS EMPIRICALLY AND DEFEND THE ROLE OF A METHODOLOGICAL INDIVIDUALIST MODEL FROM A SOCIOLOGICAL APPROACH BASED MORE ON SOCIOLOGICAL THAN PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES FOR EXPLAINING THE USE OF THE INTERNET.","UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.;  UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.","ALBERO, CT (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.","AIBAR E, 1996, DOI 10.2307/40183990; DAVIS F, 1986; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DAVIS F, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; ELSTER J, 1990; GOMEZ M, 1992; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00396.x; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; INGLEHART R, 1991; LEVY P, 2007; LIN C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.soscij.2009.03.004; LOPEZ-BONILLA L, 2006; LYNOTT P, 2000, DOI 10.1300/j074v12n01_02; MACKENZIE D, 1999; MALHOTRA Y, 1999; LOPEZ-BONILLA J, 2012; MATHIESON K, 1991, DOI 10.1287/isre.2.3.173; MORALES J M R, 2010; NOGUERA JOSE A, 2010; NORRIS P, 2001; QUINTANILLA M, 2005; ROBLES J M, 2012; RUIZ M, 2010; TAYLOR S, 1995, DOI 10.1287/isre.6.2.144; ALBERO C, 2011, DOI 10.3989/ris.2010.01.15; TORRES C, 2012; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VENKATESH V, 2000, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926",5,2017,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000407284800001,ISI,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID;UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,NA,"ALBERO CT, 2017, PAPERS","ALBERO CT, 2017, PAPERS",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.5565/rev/papers.2233,NA,SOCIOLOGY,5,"UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, SERV PUBLICACIONS",NA,WOS

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - THE AUTHORS USE DATA FOR FIRMS AND HOUSEHOLDS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IN THE EU-27. FACTORIAL AND CLUSTER ANALYSES ARE USED TO THE DETERMINE COMBINED PATTERNS FOR BOTH DIMENSIONS AND TO ELABORATE A TAXONOMY OF THE EUROPEAN REGIONS, RESPECTIVELY. FINALLY, THE MULTIPLE DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS SERVES TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS THAT CHARACTERIZE THE PATTERNS DETECTED. FINDINGS - THE RESULTS SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF THREE REGIONAL CLUSTERS THAT CAPTURE DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF PATENTING AND ICT USE. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) EXPENDITURE IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, GOVERNMENT QUALITY, GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA, THE NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS, AND EMPLOYMENT BY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EDUCATION ATTAINED ARE THE KEY VARIABLES EXPLAINING THE DISPARITIES IN INNOVATION AND ICT USE IN THE EUROPEAN REGIONS.

THE STUDY CAN PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE DESIGN OF PUBLIC POLICIES THAT MAY CONSIDER THE COMMON FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN COMBINATIONS OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY USE.","UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, DEPT DEV ECON, MADRID, SPAIN.;  UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, DEPT APPL ECON, MADRID, SPAIN.;  UNIV PUBL NAVARRA, DEPT ECON, PAMPLONA, SPAIN.","MARCO, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, DEPT APPL ECON, MADRID, SPAIN.","ALI T, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0971721814561394; BILLON M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/09654310701748009; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00461.x; BLOOM N, 2013, DOI 10.3982/ecta9466; BUESA M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2010.02.016; CAMAGNI R, 2013, DOI 10.1111/grow.12012; CHARRON N, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11205-014-0702-y; CRESCENZI R, 2007, DOI 10.1093/jeg/lbm030; CRESCENZI R, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-17761-3; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; DASGUPTA S, 2005, DOI 10.1080/13600810500137889; DE DOMINICIS L, 2013, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2012.663474; DOMENECH J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/13504851.2013.864032; EUROFOUND, 2012; EVANGELISTA R, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10438599.2014.918438; FUJITA M, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1435-5957.2005.00021.x; GALLIANO D, 2011, DOI 10.1068/a43167; GASPAR J, 1998, DOI 10.1006/juec.1996.2031; GEROSKI P, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00092-x; GOSSLING T, 2007, DOI 10.1080/09654310601078788; GREUNZ L, 2004, DOI 10.1007/s00191-004-0234-8; GRUBESIC T, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00021-6; GRUBESIC T, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2006.05.001; GURMU S, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s00181-007-0176-8; HAIR J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2011.02.019; HEMPELL T, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1043859042000269106; JOHNSON R, 2007; LI R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.06.004; LUNDVALL B, 2016; MAGGIONI M, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1435-5957.2007.00130.x; MANSFIELD E, 1968; MARKIDES C, 2006, DOI 10.1108/14601060610663532; MARTINELLI M, 2006; MORENO R, 2005, DOI 10.1068/a37341; MORENO R, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s00168-005-0021-y; MORENO R, 2006, DOI 10.1080/09654310600933330; NARDELLI G, 2012; NAVARRO M, 2009, DOI 10.1068/c0884r; NELSON R R, 1993; NELSON R, 1966; NEOKOSMIDIS I, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.006; OECD, 2013, DOI 10.1787/9789264204256-5-en; PRIEGER J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.11.003; RODRIGUEZ-POSE A, 2008, DOI 10.1080/00343400701654186; ROGERS E, 2010; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; ROSENBERG N, 1972, DOI 10.1016/0014-4983(72)90001-0; SCHLEIFE K, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003; SCHUBERT P, 2007, DOI 10.1080/10196780601136799; SINGH S, 2012, DOI 10.1108/14468951211213859; SLEUWAEGEN L, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2014.03.014; STIAKAKIS E, 2010; STORPER M, 2004, DOI 10.1093/jnlecg/lbh027; TAPPEINER G, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2007.07.013; TODTLING F, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0969776411428498; TRANOS E, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0969776409340866; VERSPAGEN B, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s00168-009-0293-8; VINCIGUERRA S, 2011, DOI 10.1080/10438599.2011.562358; ZOOK M, 2006, DOI 10.1002/aris.1440400109",11,2017,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000404809400009,ISI,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID;UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID;UNIV PUBL NAVARRA,UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,NA,"BILLON M, 2017, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE","BILLON M, 2017, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1108/itp-05-2015-0098,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"SPANISH MINISTRY OF SCIENCE [ECO2010-21393-C04-03, ECO2013-48496-C4-2-R]",WOS

IT ALSO OFFERS NEW ROUTES TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INCLUSION FOR DISABLED PEOPLE. RESEARCH ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SHOWS THAT SOCIAL FACTORS AFFECT INTERNET ACCESS BUT DISABILITY STATUS IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED. THIS PAPER ASSESSES THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISABILITY MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND HOW IT INTERACTS WITH OTHER SOCIAL EFFECTS TO PRODUCE DISTINCTIVE FORMS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION. THE ANALYSIS USES SURVEY DATA FROM 27 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO EXPLORE AND MODEL, STATISTICALLY, THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INTERNET ACCESS, DISABILITY STATUS, AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION, HOUSEHOLD FINANCIAL SITUATION AND HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION. MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THAT SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS CAN EXPLAIN MUCH VARIANCE IN OUTCOMES BUT THERE IS A DISTINCTIVE DISABILITY EFFECT. IN PARTICULAR, THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT, AGING AND LIVING ALONE ARE EXACERBATED AMONG DISABLED PEOPLE. NEW POLICIES TO STRENGTHEN E-ACCESSIBILITY, ARISING FROM THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, ARE IMPORTANT BUT CANNOT IGNORE THOSE WHO ARE STILL EXCLUDED FROM THE ONLINE REVOLUTION. DISABLED PEOPLE ARE OVER-REPRESENTED IN THIS GROUP. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT BOTH ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THIS.","UNIV LEEDS, WORK & EMPLOYMENT RELAT DIV, LEEDS, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LEEDS, SCH SOCIOL & SOCIAL POLICY, SOCIAL SCI BLDG, LEEDS LS2 9JT, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.","YALCIN, B (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LEEDS, SCH SOCIOL & SOCIAL POLICY, SOCIAL SCI BLDG, LEEDS LS2 9JT, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.; SCHOLZ, F (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LEEDS, LEEDS UNIV BUSINESS SCH, WORK & EMPLOYMENT RELAT DIV, LEEDS LS2 9JT, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.","ADAM A, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180802552940; BAKARDJIEVA M, 2005; BARGH J, 2004, DOI 10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141922; CULLEN R, 2003, DOI 10.1108/02640470310480506; DOBRANSKY K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600751298; EASTON C, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s10209-011-0268-2; EUROSTAT, 2016; EUROSTAT, 2016; GOGGIN G, 2000, DOI 10.1080/01972240050032889; GRAMMENOS S, 2015; GREENFIELD D, 2002, DOI 10.1089/109493102760275590; HARGITTAI E, 2001; NORRIS P, 2001; OLIVER M, 1990; PILLING, 2004; RAGNEDDA M, 2013; VICENTE M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01615440903423245; SEVRON L, 2002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; WALL P S, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s1096-7516(03)00046-0; WARSCHAUER M, 2004; WELLMAN B, 2008",31,2017,COMMUNICATION; PSYCHOLOGY,WOS:000404363200011,ISI,UNIV LEEDS;UNIV LEEDS,UNIV LEEDS;UNIV LEEDS,NA,"SCHOLZ F, 2017, CYBERPSYCHOLOGY","SCHOLZ F, 2017, CYBERPSYCHOLOGY",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.5817/cp2017-1-4,NA,"COMMUNICATION; PSYCHOLOGY, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",31,"MASARYKOVA UNIV, FAC SOCIAL STUDIES",NA,WOS

WE CONSIDER THE DEFINITIONS AND BOUNDARIES OF THE TMMC, ARGUING PARTICULARLY FOR A HISTORICALLY ROOTED CONCEPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT THAT ALLOWS BETTER INTEGRATION OF THE DIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL TRADITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON THE SAME SET OF EMPIRICAL PHENOMENA. WE THEN DELINEATE TWO RECURRENT DEBATES IN THE LITERATURE HIGHLIGHTING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMERGING KNOWLEDGE. THE FIRST DEBATE CONCERNS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN SCHOLARS WHO PRIVILEGE MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES, AND SEE THEM AS DRIVING FORCES OF MOVEMENT DYNAMICS, AND THOSE WHO PRIVILEGE MEDIA PRACTICES OVER AFFORDANCES. THE SECOND DEBATE BROADLY OPPOSES THEORISTS WHO BELIEVE IN THE EMANCIPATORY POTENTIAL OF ICTS AND THOSE WHO HIGHLIGHT THE WAYS THEY ARE USED TO REPRESS SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND GRASSROOTS MOBILIZATION. BY MAPPING POSITIONS IN THESE DEBATES TO THE TMMC WE IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE DIRECTION TO THREE BROAD RESEARCH AREAS WHICH DEMAND FURTHER CONSIDERATION: (I) QUESTIONS OF POWER AND AGENCY IN SOCIAL MOVEMENTS; (II) THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN, ON THE ONE HAND, SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY AND MEDIA AS POLITICS (I.E. CYBERPOLITICS AND TECHNOPOLITICS), AND ON THE OTHER, THE QUOTIDIAN AND UBIQUITOUS USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS IN A DIGITAL AGE; AND (III) THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIGITAL DIVIDES THAT CUT ACROSS AND BEYOND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE WAY SUCH DIVISIONS MAY OVERLAY EXISTING POWER RELATIONS IN MOVEMENTS. IN CONCLUSION, WE DELINEATE SIX CHALLENGES FOR PROFITABLE FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE TMMC.","UNIV ABERDEEN, DEPT SOCIOL, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND.;  UNIV MANCHESTER, MANCHESTER, LANCS, ENGLAND.","FOMINAYA, CF (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ABERDEEN, DEPT SOCIOL, ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND.","BAKER M, 2016; BELL D, 1974; BENKLER Y, 2006; BENNETT W, 2012, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.670661; BERLINGUER, 2014; BIMBER B, 2012, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511978777; BLANCO V F S, 2011; BLANK G, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0894439316671698; BOLER M, 2010; BONILLA Y, 2015, DOI 10.1111/amet.12112; BROADBENT J, 2003; BROCK A, 2015; BRYM R, 2014, DOI 10.1111/1468-4446.12080; CAMMAERTS B, 2015, DOI 10.1080/13183222.2015.1017264; CARTY V, 2002, DOI 10.1080/1474283022000010646; CASERO-RIPOLLES A, 2012; CASTELLS M, 1996; CASTELLS M, 2006; CASTELLS M, 2013; CASTELLS M, 2015; CHESTERS G, 2006; COLEMAN E, 2010, DOI 10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.104945; COLEMAN E G, 2015; COLEMAN G, 2010; COLEMAN G, 2013; COSTANZA-CHOCK S, 2012, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2012.710746; DAHLBERG L, 2001, DOI 10.1080/13691180110097030; DE SOUZA E SILVA A, 2006; DELUCA K, 2002, DOI 10.1080/07393180216559; DOLATA U, 2016, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2015.1055722; ELMER G, 2015; FEENBERG A, 2002; FEENSTRA RAMON A, 2014; FERNANDEZ-PLANELLS A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814530097; FIRER-BLAESS S, 2016; FLESHER FOMINAYA C, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-1-137-40216-5; FOMINAYA C, 2017, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2016.1256193; FOMINAYA C, 2016, DOI 10.1017/s1755773914000423; FOMINAYA C, 2015, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2014.945075; FREELON D, 2016; FREEMAN J, 2013, DOI 10.1353/wsq.2013.0072; GALLO-CRUZ S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2016.1252664; GANESH S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/03637751.2013.828156; GARTON L, 1995, DOI 10.1080/23808985.1995.11678923; GIBSON R, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444812457329; GILLAN K, 2014; GILLAN K, 2008; GILLAN K, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180802158532; GILLESPIE T, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342738; GITLIN T, 2003; GORDON J, 2006; GUSTAFSSON N, 2010; HARGITTAI E, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x; HIMANEN P, 2001; HINTZ A, 2015; HORTON D, 2004, DOI 10.1080/0964401042000274304; HWANG H, 2006, DOI 10.1207/s15327825mcs0904_5; JACKSON S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1106571; JOHNSTON H, 2014; JORDAN T, 2015; JORDAN T, 2002; JORDAN T, 2013; JURIS J, 2013, DOI 10.1215/9780822395867; JURIS J, 2008; KAVADA A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1043318; KAVADA A, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180802304854; KHONDKER H, 2011, DOI 10.1080/14747731.2011.621287; KIESLER S, 1992, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(92)90047-b; KIRKPATRICK G, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-1-137-02014-7; KRINSKY J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2013.862787; LEISTERT O, 2015; LERUTH B, 2016; LESSIG L, 2002; LIEVROUW L, 2011; LOVINK G, 2012; MAIDABORN V, 2014; MARGETTS H, 2016; MARGOLIS M, 2000; MATTONI A, 2012; MCCARTHY JOHN D, 1996; MELUCCI A, 1994; MILAN S, 2013, DOI 10.1057/9781137313546; MILAN S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1043135; MONTERDE A, 2014; MORELL M, 2012, DOI 10.1080/14742837.2012.710323; MOROZOV E, 2012; NIELSEN R, 2013, DOI 10.1111/tsq.12015; NIELSEN R, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810380863; ODDSDOTTIR K, 2014, DOI 10.7574/cjicl.03.04.246; OFCOM: OFFICE OF C, 2016; OLIVER P, 2000, DOI 10.1086/316964; OLSON M, 1965; PENA-LOPEZ I, 2014, DOI 10.1080/14636204.2014.931678; PICKERILL J, 2004; PICKERILL J, 2003; PLEYERS G, 2011; POSTILL J, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1354856514541350; REDSHAW T, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0725513616689390; RHEINGOLD H, 1993; ROMANOS E, 2015; RYAN C, 1991; SHIRKY C, 2009; SIAPERA E, 2011; SMITH J, 2001, DOI 10.1353/sof.2001.0053; SPEARS R, 2002, DOI 10.1177/104649602237170; STALDER F, 2010; STOYCHEFF N, 2016; TUFEKCI Z, 2015; TUFEKCI Z, 2014, DOI 10.1002/1944-2866.poi362; TUFEKCI Z, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2012.01629.x; TUFEKCI Z, 2014; WALL M, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807075007; WEBSTER F, 2008, DOI 10.1057/9780230596382; WOLFSON T, 2014",25,2017,GOVERNMENT & LAW; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000404257100001,ISI,UNIV ABERDEEN;UNIV MANCHESTER,UNIV ABERDEEN,NA,"FOMINAYA CF, 2017, SOC MOV STUD","FOMINAYA CF, 2017, SOC MOV STUD",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/14742837.2017.1338943,NA,POLITICAL SCIENCE; SOCIOLOGY,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

THERE IS A SMALL, BUT SIGNIFICANT, PROPORTION OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME, NOR HAVE SUFFICIENT DIGITAL SKILLS TO ENGAGE ONLINE IN WAYS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO THEM. THIS PAPER PRESENTS FINDINGS FROM A TWO-YEAR SCHOOL AND LOCAL COUNCIL-RUN INITIATIVE IN ENGLAND TO PROVIDE 30 SUCH DIGITALLY DISADVANTAGED YOUNG PEOPLE WITH A LAPTOP AND STABLE INTERNET CONNECTION AT HOME AS WELL AS SCHOOL SUPPORT. DRAWING ON RICH QUALITATIVE DATA (HOME AND SCHOOL VISITS; PARENT, STUDENT, AND TEACHER INTERVIEWS), WE EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE, PARENTS, AND TEACHERS WHO WERE PART OF THIS DIGITAL INCLUSION SCHEME. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINE HOW THE LONG-STANDING ESSENTIALIST DISCOURSES AROUND DIGITAL YOUTH' AND DETERMINIST IDEAS OF TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL CHANGE INFORM HOW SUCH A SCHEME IS PERCEIVED, ENACTED, AND EXPERIENCED BY THE TEACHERS, PARENTS, AND YOUNG PEOPLE INVOLVED WITH THE INITIATIVE, AS WELL AS THE IMPLICATIONS THESE DISCOURSES HAVE FOR THE WAYS THE OUTCOMES OF SUCH PROJECTS ARE JUDGED.","UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD, ENGLAND.;  UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST OII, OXFORD, ENGLAND.;  UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EDUC, OXFORD, ENGLAND.","EYNON, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD, ENGLAND.; EYNON, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST OII, OXFORD, ENGLAND.; EYNON, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, DEPT EDUC, OXFORD, ENGLAND.","ALLEN M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/13691180903456553; BAYNE S, 2011; BIAGI F, 2013, DOI 10.1111/ejed.12016; BIESTA G, 2013, DOI 10.2304/pfie.2013.11.6.733; BOONAERT T, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0907568210367524; BOYD D, 2014; BUCKINGHAM D, 1998, DOI 10.1177/0267323198013004007; BUCKINGHAM D, 2006; BUCKINGHAM D, 2007; CLARK L S, 2012; CLARK L, 2005, DOI 10.1080/07393180500312985; CLARK L, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480300500106; DAVIES C, 2013; DAVIES H C, 2017; DENZIN N, 2001; DEPARTMENT OF E, 2013; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1086/ahr/69.3.805; EYNON R, 2012; EYNON R, 2015; EYNON R, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.09.020; FACER K, 2001, DOI 10.1080/13676260120101905; FRIESEN N, 2008; GOODE J, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809343560; GREENHOW C, 2009, DOI 10.1080/17439880902923580; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.957711; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01411920902989227; HOLLOWAY S, 2003; HOLMES J, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810397649; JENKINS H, 2006; JEWITT C, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00434.x; KVALE S, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1077800406286235; LIEVROUW L, 2003, DOI 10.1002/aris.1440370112; LIVINGSTONE S, 2009, DOI 10.1332/policypress/9781847424396.001.0001; LIVINGSTONE S, 2003, DOI 10.1177/1461444803005002001; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LIVINGSTONE S, 2012, DOI 10.1080/03054985.2011.577938; LIVINGSTONE S, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342697; MICHELI M, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010003; MILLER J, 2010; MURDOCK G, 2004; OBLINGER D, 2005; PAGANI L, 2016, DOI 10.1080/03055698.2016.1148588; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; PILLOW W, 2003, DOI 10.1080/0951839032000060635; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; RICHARDSON L, 2005; RITCHIE J, 1994, DOI 10.4324/9780203413081_chapter_9; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; SACHS J, 2001, DOI 10.1080/02680930010025347; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0163443703025003004; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2014; SIMS C, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.808363; SINDING C, 2003, DOI 10.1177/1468794103003001770; STAKE R, 1995; STRAUBHAAR J, 2012; SWANBORN P, 2010; TRIPP L, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810375293; TUFEKCI Z, 2012; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 1999; WARSCHAUER M, 2011, DOI 10.1162/ijlm_a_00069; WARSCHAUER M, 2010, DOI 10.3102/0091732x09349791",14,2017,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000403156900006,ISI,UNIV OXFORD;UNIV OXFORD;UNIV OXFORD,UNIV OXFORD;UNIV OXFORD;UNIV OXFORD,NA,"WILKIN S, 2017, OXF REV EDUC","WILKIN S, 2017, OXF REV EDUC",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/03054985.2017.1305058,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

TO PROVIDE HISTORICAL CONTEXT WE PRESENT A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC LIBRARY, THE NATIONAL LIBRARY AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL DURING THE PERIOD OF INDEPENDENCE WARS IN 19TH-CENTURY URUGUAY, AND THE LEGACY OF EDUCATIONAL REFORMS THAT FOLLOWED, WHICH ARE AT THE CORE OF THE CULTURAL IDENTITY OF URUGUAY. WE THEN ANALYZE THE AMBIVALENT ACHIEVEMENTS OF ""PLAN CEIBAL"", A STATE PROGRAMME AIMED AT PROVIDING LAPTOPS TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND A BOTTOM-UP PROJECT CALLED ""BIBLIOTECA NUEVO ROBLE"" (NEW OAK LIBRARY), A PROJECT RUN BY STUDENTS OF THE INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION AT URUGUAY'S STATE UNIVERSITY THAT AIMS AT THE CREATION OF A SCHOOL LIBRARY AT PUBLIC SCHOOL NO. 230, LOCATED IN A LOW-INCOME QUARTER OF MONTEVIDEO. THE CONCLUSION ANALYZES THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND INFORMATION. THE PAPER AIMS AT A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY SHOWING WHAT REMAINS HIDDEN BEHIND THEORETICAL AMBITIONS, DOGMATISMS, ECONOMIC INTERESTS, AND POLITICAL PROJECTS.

IN THIS PAPER THREE BASIC COMPONENTS ARE DISCUSSED REGARDING DIGITAL EDUCATION OF CHILDREN: THE FAMILY AS A MEDIATOR IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS OF CHILDREN; THE DIGITAL GAP AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENOUGH SKILLS TO USE DIGITAL SERVICES; AS WELL AS THE AUTHORITY WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE MENTORING OF CHILDREN BASED ON THE CAPACITY THAT REFERENCE ADULTS DEVELOP THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES, WHICH AS PARENTS ENABLE THEM TO EXERCISE THEIR AUTHORITY IN ALL AREAS, GOING FROM MORAL TO KNOWLEDGE. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE FAMILY HAS TO ACQUIRE A TWO-FOLD VISION OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES THAT COMPROMISES MANY OF THE BASIC VALUES OF THEIR ROLE ON EDUCATING CHILDREN. THIS DOUBLE VISION IS REPRESENTED BY THE POSITIVE POLE: PROGRESS, TASK FACILITATION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEMS, AND THE NEGATIVE POLE: INVOLUTION, FACILITATION OF NEW RISKS, AND GREATER PERSONAL AND SOCIAL VULNERABILITY.

TO DO SO, IT USES THE 2012 PIAAC SURVEY ADMINISTERED TO 6,055 SPANIARDS ON THE VARIABLES RELATED TO THE USE OF ICTS IN THE WORKPLACE. DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT, TAKING THE CATEGORIES OF DIGITAL IMMIGRANT AND DIGITAL NATIVE AS THE REFERENCE, AND ADDING ANOTHER VARIABLE: PRE-DIGITAL IMMIGRANT. BROADLY SPEAKING, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT 'PRE-DIGITAL IMMIGRANTS' (WHO STARTED TO USE ICTS LATE) USE ICTS LESS AT WORK COMPARED TO 'DIGITAL IMMIGRANTS' (WHO STARTED TO USE ICTS VIA AN ADAPTATION PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN THEIR EARLY OR MIDADULTHOOD), ALTHOUGH THEY USE THEM MORE THAN 'DIGITAL NATIVES' (WHO STARTED TO USE ICTS AT A VERY YOUNG AGE).

WHILE SNS ARE IN PRINCIPLE HIGHLY CONVENIENT SPACES FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION, LACK OF ACCESS OR DOMINATION BY SOCIALLY INSIGNIFICANT SMALL TALK MAY INDICATE UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE. AT THE SAME TIME, AGENDA DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REGIONS MAY SIGNAL ABOUT LOCAL PROBLEMS. IN THIS STUDY WE SEEK TO FIND OUT WHETHER REGIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE EXISTS IN SUCH A LARGE COUNTRY AS RUSSIA. WE START FROM A THEORY OF UNEVEN MODERNIZATION OF RUSSIA AND USE THE DATA FROM ITS MOST POPULAR SNS ""VK.COM"" AS A PROXY FOR MEASURING DIGITAL INEQUALITY. BY ANALYZING USER ACTIVITY DATA FROM A SAMPLE OF 77,000 USERS AND TEXTS FROM A CAREFULLY SELECTED SUB-SAMPLE OF 36,000 USERS WE CONCLUDE THAT REGIONAL LEVEL EXPLAINS AN EXTREMELY SMALL SHARE OF VARIANCE IN THE OVERALL VARIATION OF BEHAVIORAL USER DATA. A NOTABLE EXCEPTION IS ATTENTION TO THE TOPICS OF ISLAM AND UKRAINE. HOWEVER, OUR DATA REVEAL THAT HISTORICALLY GEOGRAPHICAL PENETRATION OF ""VK.COM"" PROCEEDED FROM THE REGIONS CONSIDERED THE MOST MODERNIZED TO THOSE CONSIDERED THE MOST TRADITIONAL.

NOWADAYS, FULL AND EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY [2] IS NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT FULL AND EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION IN MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION. TO DATE, THERE IS NO VALID DATA ABOUT MEDIA USAGE BY THE DISABLED IN GERMANY. THIS SURVEY CONSISTS OF INTERVIEWS WITH 610 INDIVIDUALS WITH VISUAL, HEARING OR PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS, OR LEARNING DIFFICULTIES. EXPERT INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS COMPLETE THE STUDY. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT IMPAIRMENT COMES WITH SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS AS REGARDS MEDIA ACCESS AND USAGE. IN GENERAL, PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRMENTS AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES, ACCESS CONNECTED DEVICES MORE RARELY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THEY GO ON THE INTERNET LESS OFTEN AND USE IT LESS FOR COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION. MANY BLIND PEOPLE ARE OFFLINERS, IN PARTICULAR IF THEY ACQUIRED THE IMPAIRMENT IN ADULTHOOD. AGE IS AN IMPORTANT PERSONAL FACTOR DETERMINING MEDIA USAGE. THE INTERACTION OF AGE, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CONTEXT FACTORS IN PARTICULAR, LEADS TO THE EXTREMELY RARE USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA BY OLDER PEOPLE. THE DISABLED ARE HETEROGENEOUS. FULL AND EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE PARTICIPATION LEVEL: AGE, HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, OBSTACLES AND BARRIERS TO ACCESS, TECHNICAL AND PERSONAL SUPPORT.","DORTMUND UNIV TECHNOL, SCH REHABIL SCI, DORTMUND, GERMANY.","HAAGE, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), DORTMUND UNIV TECHNOL, SCH REHABIL SCI, DORTMUND, GERMANY.","BOSSE I, 2016; BOSSE I, 2016; CATON S, 2016, DOI 10.3109/13668250.2016.1153052; ELLIS K, 2015; ENGEL B, 2015; FUNKE G, 2007; HAFERKAMP N, 2014; HOFMANN J, 2010; KRUPP M, 2016; KUHL J, 2013; MAYERLE M, 2014; MEDIA P, 2015; OFCOM, 2015; OFCOM, 2015; ROBERT-KOCH-INSTITUT, 2014; UNITED N, 2006; ZAYNEL N, 2016; ZAYNEL N, 2013",7,2017,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000456927000034,ISI,DORTMUND UNIV TECHNOL,DORTMUND UNIV TECHNOL,NA,"HAAGE A, 2017, NA","HAAGE A, 2017, NA",GERMANY,10.1007/978-3-319-58700-4_34,978-3-319-58700-4; 978-3-319-58699-1,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS",8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,NA,WOS

FIRST, IT AIMS TO FIND OUT WHAT FACTORS EXPLAIN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. SECOND, THE ARTICLE AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE GROUPS THAT ARE DIGITALLY EXCLUDED. THE ARTICLE IS BASED ON SURVEY DATA (N = 2,304) COLLECTED IN SPAIN, WHICH ARE ANALYZED USING MULTIPLE REGRESSION, PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS, AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS. RESULTS CONCLUSIONS TWO DIMENSIONS ARE IDENTIFIED: THE FIRST IS THE COMPREHENSIVE USE OF INTERNET AND THE SECOND IS THE NATURE OF THIS USE, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN A PROFESSIONAL USE AND A RECREATIONAL AND SOCIAL USE OF INTERNET. THE ARTICLE VERIFIES THAT FACTORS EXPLAINING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE AGE, EDUCATION LEVEL, AND INCOME. THE ARTICLE IDENTIFIES DIGITALLY EXCLUDED SEGMENTS, AND THE EFFORTS AND ACTIONS FOR DIGITAL TRAINING TO ERADICATE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT THESE GROUPS. THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM IS ENCOUNTERED IN HOMEWORKERS WHO ARE MAINLY WOMAN. NEETS (NOT IN EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, OR TRAINING) ARE FREQUENT USERS OF INTERNET, BUT THEY ONLY USE IT FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND TO CERTAIN EXTENT THEY ARE DIGITALLY EXCLUDED.","UNIV ZARAGOZA, ZARAGOZA, SPAIN.;  ARAGONESE AGCY RES & DEV ARAID, ZARAGOZA, SPAIN.","BRUSCA, I (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZARAGOZA, DEPT ACCOUNTING & FINANCE, FAC ECON & EMPRESA, GRAN VIA 2, ZARAGOZA 50005, SPAIN.","AHN J, 2011, DOI 10.2190/ec.45.2.b; ALAM K, 2015, DOI 10.1108/itp-04-2014-0083; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BANDURA A, 1986; BELANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; BOBKOWSKI P, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0163443713491517; CASEMAJOR N, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0163443715584098; CHINN M, 2006; COOPER J, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00185.x; CZAJA SARA J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10209-006-0060-x; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DEWAN S, 2005; EUROPEAN C, 2016; FELTER M, 1985; FORMAN C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2004.10.005; FUCHS C, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; GIBBS J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309472; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.wsif.2011.07.001; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; HOFFMAN D L, 2000; HUNT N P, 1993; KLECUN E, 2008, DOI 10.1108/09593840810896028; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; PEREA T, 2004, DOI 10.1108/09564230410523358; PORTER C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.06.003; RAGNEDDA M, 2015; RICE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5; ROGERS E, 2010; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; SIPIOR J, 2011, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2010.64; TAIPALE S, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814536574; TAIPALE S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.05.005; TSATSOU P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0163443710393865; VALADEZ J, 2007, DOI 10.1353/hsj.2007.0013; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57; VAN DIJK J, 2009; VAN DIJK J, 2013; WARREN M, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.001; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; ZHANG X, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.12.011",15,2018,GOVERNMENT & LAW; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000449992200010,ISI,UNIV ZARAGOZA;ARAGONESE AGCY RES AND DEV ARAID,UNIV ZARAGOZA,NA,"SERRANO-CINCA C, 2018, SOC SCI Q","SERRANO-CINCA C, 2018, SOC SCI Q",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1111/ssqu.12504,NA,POLITICAL SCIENCE; SOCIOLOGY,16,WILEY,"SPANISH MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND SCIENCE [ECO2013-45568-R]; EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND [ECO2013-45568-R]; GOVERNMENT OF ARAGON [S-14 (3), S-86, S-25]",WOS

THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES ON CHILDREN'S TIME IN SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH DEBATE AND CONCERN. YET WE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT CHANGE IN CHILDREN'S DAILY TIME IN SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THEIR TIME USING DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS. USING DATA FROM TWO NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE UK TIME USE SURVEYS 2000-01 AND 2014-15, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A DETAILED STUDY OF CHANGE IN CHILDREN'S (8-18 YEARS) DAILY TIME IN SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES (TV, VIDEOGAMES, AND COMPUTERS), TOGETHER WITH THE LATEST DATA ON THEIR TIME USING COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE FIND THAT CHILDREN'S SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY AROUND HALF AN HOUR BETWEEN 2000 AND 2015, BUT THAT THIS WAS CONCENTRATED AMONG BOYS WHO INCREASED THEIR TIME PLAYING VIDEOGAMES. DWARFING THIS, HOWEVER, WAS THE ADDITIONAL TIME CHILDREN SPENT USING COMPUTERS AND MOBILE DEVICES WHEN ENGAGING IN OTHER ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, ESPECIALLY FOR GIRLS. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHILDREN'S SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES REVEALED THAT GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CHILDREN'S TIME PLAYING VIDEOGAMES WIDENED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THIS PERIOD, WHILE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES IN CHILDREN'S SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES REMAINED FIXED. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS HOW CHILDREN ARE COMBINING OLD AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR DAILY LIVES, AND POINTS TO ISSUES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MEASUREMENT OF CHILDREN'S ENGAGEMENT IN SCREEN-BASED ACTIVITIES TO AID IN ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CHILDREN'S WELL-BEING.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT SOCIOL, CTR TIME USE RES, 74 WOODSTOCK RD, OXFORD OX2 6HP, ENGLAND.","MULLAN, K (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, DEPT SOCIOL, CTR TIME USE RES, 74 WOODSTOCK RD, OXFORD OX2 6HP, ENGLAND.","BEN-ARIEH E, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0907568202009002805; BOND E, 2014; BROOKS F, 2016, DOI 10.1080/13676261.2015.1048200; BUCKSCH J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2015.11.014; BUCKSCH J, 2014, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-14-351; CAIN N, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.sleep.2010.02.006; CARSON V, 2016, DOI 10.1139/apnm-2015-0630; CLARK L, 2014; EVANS C, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0192513x11400558; FLETCHER E, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s12187-013-9212-8; GERSHUNY J, 2000; GRANIC I, 2014, DOI 10.1037/a0034857; HOFFERTH S, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01494.x; HOLLOWAY S, 2003; LAREAU A, 2003; LIVINGSTON S, 2014; LIVINGSTONE S, 1999; LIVINGSTONE S, 2016; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/08838150802437396; MARSHALL S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2005.08.016; MENDOZA K, 2009, DOI 10.23860/jmle-1-1-3; MULLAN K, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-4446.2009.01273.x; NIKKEN P, 2014, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2013.782038; ONS OFFICE FOR NATIONAL S, 2017; PALMER S, 2007; SILVA K, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s00038-013-0464-3; STAFFORD F, 1985; STEWART J, 2013; SUCHERT V, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.026; TREMBLAY M, 2011, DOI 10.1186/1479-5868-8-98; TURKLE S, 2011; WITT E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.025",25,2018,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000450529000006,ISI,UNIV OXFORD,UNIV OXFORD,NA,"MULLAN K, 2018, CHILD INDIC RES","MULLAN K, 2018, CHILD INDIC RES",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1007/s12187-017-9509-0,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",26,SPRINGER,"ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [ES/LO11662/1]; EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL [339703]; ESRC [ES/F037937/1, ES/L011662/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [RES-000-23-0704-A, ES/F037937/1, ES/L011662/1, RES-000-23-0704] FUNDING SOURCE: RESEARCHFISH",WOS

HOWEVER, THE POTENTIALLY TRANSFORMATIVE INFLUENCE OF M-HEALTH IS LIMITED, AS MANY OLDER ADULTS RESIST ADOPTION LEADING TO THE EMERGENCE OF AN AGE-BASED DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS STUDY LEVERAGES PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY AND SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY TO EXPLORE THE FACTORS DRIVING RESISTANCE AMONG OLDER ADULTS. THIS MIXED METHODS STUDY INTEGRATES SURVEY FINDINGS WITH INSIGHTS FROM QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE M-HEALTH DIGITAL DIVIDE IS DEEPENING DUE TO OLDER ADULTS' PERCEIVED INABILITY TO ADOPT AND THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO ADOPT STEMMING FROM MISTRUST, HIGH RISK PERCEPTIONS, AND STRONG DESIRE FOR PRIVACY. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE PRIVACY AND SOCIAL INCLUSION LITERATURE BY DEMONSTRATING THAT WHILE MANY OLDER ADULTS HAVE ACCESS TO M-HEALTH, THEY ARE CURRENTLY EXCLUDED AND REQUIRE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BY TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS AND RESEARCHERS.

FOR THIS, TWO STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED USING QUOTA SAMPLING OF OLDER ADULTS WHO USED BOTH TYPES OF DLS. USING A STRUCTURAL EQUATION METHODOLOGY, THE DATA SHOWED THAT THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS WERE ASSOCIATED TO THE MOST BASIC LEVELS OF ACCESS AND USE OF THE INTERNET, AND LIKEWISE, THAT THE DLS COULD MODERATE THE OBSTACLES DERIVED FROM AGE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC RESOURCES.","UNIV HUELVA, DEPT EDUC, CAMPUS EL CARMEN, HUELVA 21007, SPAIN.;  UNIV HUELVA, DEPT PSICHOL & EDUC, CAMPUS EL CARMEN, HUELVA 21007, SPAIN.","HERNANDO-GOMEZ, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV HUELVA, DEPT PSICHOL & EDUC, CAMPUS EL CARMEN, HUELVA 21007, SPAIN.","ANDERSON G, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.12.001; BARNARD Y, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.006; BERRIO-ZAPATA C, 2014, DOI 10.3916/c43-2014-13; BERTOT J, 2008, DOI 10.1086/588445; BHATNAGAR A, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0148-2963(03)00067-5; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BOND G, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0145721710366758; BROADY T, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2008.00914.x; BYRNE BARBARA M, 2013; CHAFFIN A, 2007, DOI 10.3928/00989134-20070301-03; CHEN W, 2005; CHEN Y, 2002, DOI 10.1080/03601270290099921; CIMPERMAN M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.03.002; CURRAN P, 1996, DOI 10.1037//1082-989x.1.1.16; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GATTO S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03601270802243697; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HAIR JR J, 2010; HAKKARAINEN P, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1461444812442663; HARDILL I, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.03.016; HEART T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.03.002; HIRZALLA F, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.534360; HOGARTH JEANNE M, 2008, DOI 10.1504/ijebank.2008.020437; KAISER H, 1960, DOI 10.1177/001316446002000116; KANIA-LUNDHOLM M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2015.07.008; KIM J, 2017, DOI 10.1093/geronb/gbw123; KLIMOVA B, 2016, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2015.1122447; LACRUZ M, 2011; MA Q, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2015.11.015; MILIONI D, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1354856513517366; MORALES A, 2009; NEVES B, 2012, DOI 10.15353/joci.v8i1.3061; NEVES B, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.2998; OLSSON T, 2016; QUAN-HAASE A, 2002, DOI 10.1002/9780470774298.ch10; QUAN-HAASE A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1140217; RASI P, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-39949-2_23; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SERVON L J, 2008; SMITH A, 2014; SUM S, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0010; SYLVESTER D, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0894439309335148; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2017; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.012; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1111401; TSAI H, 2015, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2015.1048165; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; VILLAR F, 2010, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x10000565; VIVES M, 2015, DOI 10.7179/psri_; VROMAN K, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.018; WAGNER N, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.029; WARSCHAUER M, 2004; XIE B, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10823-007-9050-6; ZHANG G, 2010; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",27,2018,SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000449348000006,ISI,UNIV HUELVA;UNIV HUELVA,UNIV HUELVA,NA,"TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2018, TECHNOL SOC","TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2018, TECHNOL SOC",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.techsoc.2018.06.001,NA,"SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",29,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"COORDINATED I + D + I PROJECT [EDU2015-64015-C3-1-R]; ""MEDIA EDUCATION NETWORK"" OF THE STATE PROGRAM FOR THE PROMOTION OF EXCELLENCE IN SCIENTIFIC-TECHNICAL RESEARCH; STATE SUBPROGRAM FOR KNOWLEDGE GENERATION - FEDER (EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND) [EDU2016-81772-REDT]; SPAIN'S MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND COMPETITIVENESS",WOS

THIS IS A DESCRIPTIVE QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH DESIGN STUDY, BASED ON A SURVEY, WITH A PARTICIPATING SAMPLE OF 293 TEACHERS FROM NON-UNIVERSITY EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. THE MOST OUTSTANDING RESULTS INDICATE THAT WOMEN AND MEN TEACHERS' PLE ARE COMPOSED BY THE SAME DIGITAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, REGARDING THE ELEMENTS OF THEIR PLE, THE PRACTICES DEVELOPED BY TEACHERS IN THE EDUCATIONAL FIELD ARE GUIDED TO THEIR OWN TRAINING, THE DISSEMINATION OF CONTENTS AMONG STUDENTS AND THE PLANNING OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES IN A COLLABORATIVE AND INDIVIDUALLY WAY. NEVERTHELESS, THE ACTIONS THAT WOMEN AND MEN TEACHERS CARRY OUT ARE DIFFERENT, GIVEN THAT WOMEN FREQUENTLY USE THEIR PLE FOR TRAINING THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS.

BY ADOPTING A SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH, WITH A MORE HOLISTIC SCOPE, THIS ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO RECONSTRUCT PART OF THE COMPLEXITY AND MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AND WITHIN PORTUGUESE GENERATIONS WITH MEDIA, THEREBY DECONSTRUCTING MORE ESSENTIALIST AND HOMOGENISING NOTIONS OF YOUTH AND GENERATIONS.","UNIV INST LISBON ISCTE IUL, DEPT SOCIOL, CTR RES & STUDIES SOCIOL CIES IUL, P-1600077 LISBON, PORTUGAL.","VIEIRA, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV INST LISBON ISCTE IUL, DEPT SOCIOL, CTR RES & STUDIES SOCIOL CIES IUL, P-1600077 LISBON, PORTUGAL.","ABOIM S, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1368431013509681; AKRICH M, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1989.tb07952.x; AROLDI P, 2007; AROLDI P, 2013, DOI 10.1386/nl.11.175_1; AROLDI P, 2003; BAYM N, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10714421.2011.573442; BENNETT A, 2014; BENNETT S, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00360.x; BENNETT S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x; BERTAUX D, 1990; BIJKER WIEBE E, 1987; BLAIKIE N, 2003; BLANK G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.804142; BLANK G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.777758; BOLIN G, 2014; BOLIN G, 2017; BOLIN G, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1367549415609327; BOURDIEU P, 2001; BOURDIEU P, 1993; BOYD D, 2014; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BUCKINGHAM D, 2013, DOI 10.1080/03060497.2013.11084274; BUCKINGHAM D, 2006; BUCKINGHAM D, 2014; BURNETT J, 2010; CARPENTIER N, 2014; CAVALLI A, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0037768604043003; COLOMBO F, 2011; CORSTEN M, 1999, DOI 10.1177/0961463x99008002003; COULDRY N, 2017; COULDRY N, 2012; DE VAUS D, 2002; DEUZE M, 2012; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; EASTIN M, 2015, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2015.1054994; EDMUNDS J, 2002; EVANS E, 2011; EYERMAN R, 1998, DOI https://; FEIXA C, 2000; FEIXA P C, 2014, DOI 10.7749/citiescommunitiesterritories.dec2014.029.rev01; FUCHS C, 2017; GIELE J Z, 1998, DOI 10.4135/9781483348919; GUMPERT G, 1985, DOI 10.1080/15295038509360059; HADDON L, 2015, DOI 10.1002/9781118290743.wbiedcs088; HADDON L, 2017, DOI 10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0115; HADDON L, 2004; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HASEBRINK U, 2012; HASEBRINK U, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1354856517700384; HASEBRINK U, 2006, DOI 10.1515/commun.2006.023; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01411920902989227; HERRING S, 2008, DOI 10.1162/dmal.9780262524834.071; HUANG H, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-45441-7; ITO M, 2009; JENKINS H, 2003; KATZ E, 1973, DOI 10.2307/2094393; KENNEDY G, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00371.x; KERTZER D, 1983, DOI 10.1146/annurev.so.09.080183.001013; KIM S, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814543162; KUOPPAMAKI S, 2018; LENHART A, 2003; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01401.x; LOOS E, 2012; LOOS E, 2012, DOI 10.15847/obsobs612012513; MACKAY H, 1992, DOI 10.1177/030631292022004006; MACKENZIE D, 1999; MADIANOU M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1367877912452486; MANNHEIM K, 1952, DOI 10.1016/s0168-8227(00)00198-4; MASCHERONI G, 2008; MILLER D, 2000; MILLS C, 2010; NIXON PAUL G, 2016; OUDSHOORN N, 2003; PILCHER J, 1994, DOI 10.2307/591659; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; PURHONEN S, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0539018415608967; RAINIE L, 2012; REISDORF B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815621539; RHEINGOLD H, 2002; RYDER N, 1965, DOI 10.2307/2090964; SACKMANN R, 2013, DOI 10.4017/gt.2013.11.4.002.00; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SCHRODER K C, 2011; SELWYN N, 2012, DOI 10.1080/03054985.2011.577949; SILVERSTONE R, 1994; SILVERSTONE R, 1996, DOI 10.1080/00213624.1997.11505978; SILVERSTONE R, 1999; SOJA E, 2011; SPITZER A, 1973, DOI 10.2307/1854096; TAIPALE S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1093528; TAPSCOTT D, 1998; THOMAS M, 2011; THOMPSON J, 1995; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817715282; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJCK J, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0163443708098245; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN REES K, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2003.09.005; WAJCMAN J, 2002; WARD, 2006; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WHITE J, 2013, DOI 10.1111/1468-4446.12015; WILLIAMS R, 1996, DOI 10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2; WOODMAN D, 2017; ZIMIC S, 2009",0,2018,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000447944500017,ISI,UNIV INST LISBON ISCTE IUL,UNIV INST LISBON ISCTE IUL,NA,"VIEIRA J, 2018, SOCIETIES","VIEIRA J, 2018, SOCIETIES",PORTUGAL,10.3390/soc8030061,NA,SOCIOLOGY,0,MDPI,"PORTUGUESE NATIONAL FUNDING AGENCY FOR SCIENCE, RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY (FCT) [UID/SOC/03126/2013]; FUNDAÇÃO PARA A CIÊNCIA E A TECNOLOGIA [UID/SOC/03126/2013] FUNDING SOURCE: FCT",WOS

IT DIGS INTO THE INDIVIDUAL PATTERN OF ADOPTION AND USE OF A BROAD SET OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES (ICT) BY INTRODUCING A CONCEPTUAL MODEL COMBINING THE EXTENDED UNIFIED THEORY OF ACCEPTANCE AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY (UTAUT2) AND THE FIVE-FACTOR MODEL OF PERSONALITY. BY DOING SO IT PROVIDES INSIGHTS ON FACTORS AFFECTING TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND THE ROLE OF PERSONALITY ON INDIVIDUAL USAGE BEHAVIOR. MOST OF THE UTAUT2 HYPOTHESES ARE SUPPORTED, WITH PERFORMANCE EXPECTANCY BEING THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR. OPENNESS IS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF BEHAVIORAL INTENTION, WHEREAS FOR USAGE BEHAVIOR THE SIGNIFICANT PERSONALITY PREDICTORS ARE OPENNESS, EXTRAVERSION, AND AGREEABLENESS. MOREOVER, AS DATA WERE COLLECTED IN BULGARIA AND PORTUGAL, A MULTI-GROUP ANALYSIS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT COUNTRY DIFFERENCES. THE EFFECT OF PERFORMANCE EXPECTANCY, HABIT, AGREEABLENESS, AND NEUROTICISM ON BEHAVIORAL INTENTION, AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF AGE ON USAGE, ARE STRONGER FOR BULGARIA, WHEREAS THE EFFECT OF HEDONIC MOTIVATION ON BEHAVIORAL INTENTION AND THE EFFECT OF BEHAVIORAL INTENTION ON USAGE ARE STRONGER FOR PORTUGAL.","UNIV NOVA LISBOA, NOVA IMS, CAMPUS CAMPOLIDE, P-1070312 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;

CAPITALIZING ON AN ORIGINAL SURVEY ADMINISTERED TO SENIORS (FOURTH-YEAR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS), OUR SURVEY DATA (N = 972) COME FROM A LARGE AMERICAN PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL WITH A PREDOMINANTLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENT BODY. THE SCHOOL'S ELECTIVE TRACKING SYSTEM AND INADEQUATE DIGITAL RESOURCES MAKE FOR AN EXCELLENT CASE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF A DIFFERENTIATED CURRICULUM AND DIGITAL INEQUALITIES ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. MULTILEVEL RANDOM-EFFECTS AND FIXED-EFFECTS REGRESSION MODELS APPLIED TO THE SURVEY DATA REVEAL THE IMPORTANT ROLE PLAYED BY DIGITAL INEQUALITIES IN SHAPING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS MEASURED BY GPA. AS THE MODELS ESTABLISH, ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH BOTH DURATION OF DIGITAL EXPERIENCE AND USAGE INTENSITY REGARDING ACADEMICALLY USEFUL COMPUTING ACTIVITIES, EVEN WHEN STUDENTS' CURRICULAR AND CLASS PLACEMENT ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. IN CONTRAST, BOTH LEISURE COMPUTING AND SMARTPHONE USAGE ARE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AS MEASURED BY GPA. ALSO WITH REGARD TO GPA, FINDINGS SHOW THAT STUDENTS IN THE HIGHER CURRICULAR TRACKS BENEFIT MORE FROM LONGER DURATIONS OF DIGITAL EXPERIENCE THAN DO STUDENTS IN LOWER CURRICULAR TRACKS. THESE RESULTS UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF FOCUSING ATTENTION ON THE WAYS IN WHICH DIGITAL INEQUALITIES COMBINE WITH CURRICULAR TRACKING IN SHAPING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.","SANTA CLARA UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, 500 EL CAMINO REAL, SANTA CLARA, CA 95053 USA.;  UNIV OSLO, DEPT SOCIOL & HUMAN GEOG, OSLO, NORWAY.;  UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, INST STUDY SOCIETAL ISSUES, RESIDENCE, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.","ROBINSON, L (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), SANTA CLARA UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, 500 EL CAMINO REAL, SANTA CLARA, CA 95053 USA.","ALLISON P D, 2009; ARCHBALD D, 2008; BALL C, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1355403; BECKER H, 2000, DOI 10.2307/1602689; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; CARBONARO W, 2005, DOI 10.1177/003804070507800102; DOMINA T, 2017, DOI 10.1146/annurev-soc-060116-053354; FRENCH M, 2015, DOI 10.1057/eej.2014.22; GAMORAN A, 1992, DOI 10.2307/2096125; GULEK J C, 2005; HALLINAN M, 1994, DOI 10.2307/2579781; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; JACKSON L, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0012-1649.42.3.429; JACKSON L, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0157; JUDGE S, 2006, DOI 10.3200/joer.100.1.52-60; JUDGE S, 2005, DOI 10.1080/02568540509594554; JUNCO R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2011.12.023; JUNCO R, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.08.020; LEI J, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2005.06.013; LUCAS S, 2002, DOI 10.2307/3090282; MESCH G, 2010; MICHELI M, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010003; NAEVDAL F, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2006.01.003; PATTERSON R, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.econedurev.2017.02.004; PETERSEN T, 2004; ROBINSON L, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813481197; ROBINSON L, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.770049; SNIJDERS T A, 2012; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; WAINER J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2007.12.007; WOOLDRIDGE J, 2002; YIN R K, 1994",11,2018,PSYCHOLOGY; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000438668600006,ISI,SANTA CLARA UNIV;UNIV OSLO;UNIV CALIF BERKELEY,SANTA CLARA UNIV,NA,"ROBINSON L, 2018, AM BEHAV SCI","ROBINSON L, 2018, AM BEHAV SCI",NORWAY;USA;USA,10.1177/0002764218773826,NA,"PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY MILLER CENTER FOR SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; BANNAN INSTITUTE-IGNATIAN CENTER FOR JESUIT EDUCATION; SCU INTERNAL RESEARCH GRANTS PROGRAM; SCU FACULTY-STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANT AWARD PROGRAM,WOS

THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, AIMED TO INVESTIGATE INTERNET USE AMONG ELDERLY EUROPEANS. REPRESENTATIVE DATA ACROSS 17 COUNTRIES FROM THE SURVEY OF HEALTH, AGEING AND RETIREMENT IN EUROPE (SHARE) WERE EXAMINED. ANALYSES WERE BASED ON THE RESPONSES OF 61,202 EUROPEANS AGED >= 50. RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THAT, ON AVERAGE, 49% OF ALL RESPONDENTS USE THE INTERNET. HOWEVER, THE SITUATION VARIES WIDELY AMONG EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. ALONGSIDE INDIVIDUAL INDICATORS, SUCH AS AGE, GENDER, AND SOCIAL CLASS, RESULTS INDICATE THAT PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH COMPUTERS DURING ONE'S TIME IN THE WORKPLACE IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNET USE IN OLD AGE. FURTHERMORE, USE OF THE INTERNET AMONG AN INDIVIDUAL'S SOCIAL NETWORK POSITIVELY INFLUENCES THEIR USE. WIDER CONTEXTUAL STRUCTURES SUCH AS AREA OF RESIDENCE AND COUNTRY-SPECIFIC WEALTH AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO TEND TO PROMOTE INTERNET USE AMONG ELDERLY EUROPEANS. DATA FROM SHARE INDICATE THAT PRIVATE INTERNET USE AMONG OLDER EUROPEANS IS DRIVEN BY PERSONAL RESOURCES, PRIOR EXPERIENCES WITH TECHNOLOGY, SOCIAL SALIENCE AS WELL AS CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES.","UNIV ZURICH, INST SOCIOL, ANDREASSTR 15, CH-8050 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;  UNIV ZURICH, DYNAM HLTH AGING, URPP, ANDREASSTR 15 BOX 2, CH-8050 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;  UNIV ZURICH, CTR COMPETENCE GERONTOL, PESTALOZZISTR 24, CH-8032 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;  HEIDELBERG UNIV, INST PSYCHOL, DEPT PSYCHOL AGEING RES, BERGHEIMER STR 20, D-69115 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY.","KONIG, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZURICH, INST SOCIOL, ANDREASSTR 15, CH-8050 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.","BORSCH-SUPAN A, 2013, DOI 10.1093/ije/dyt088; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; CHING C, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0042085905276389; COMPAINE B, 2001; CZAJA S, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.21.2.333; DOBRANSKY K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600751298; DOH M, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-20892-3_18; EUROSTAT, 2017; EUROSTAT, 2017; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HARRISON A W, 1992; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HEPP A, 2014, DOI 10.1057/9781137300355; HOX J, 2010; HUSING T, 2003; JUNG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03601270903183313; KORUPP S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/esr/jci030; KTORIDOU D, 2011, DOI 10.1108/10650741111145689; LASLETT P, 1994, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x00001677; LAWTON M, 1983, DOI 10.1093/geront/23.4.349; LENGSFELD J, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.566745; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; MAAS C J M, 2005, DOI 10.1027/1614-2241.1.3.86; MINGO I, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11205-016-1511-2; NORRIS P, 2001; OECD, 2017; OLSON K, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s12126-010-9077-9; OLSSON T, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1355007; PERRIN A, 2015; RABE-HESKETH S, 2008; ROGERS E, 2003; SACKMANN R, 2013, DOI 10.4017/gt.2013.11.4.002.00; SACKMANN R, 1994; SCHELLING H R, 2015; SEIFERT A, 2015, DOI 10.4017/gt.2015.14.1.006.00; SEIFERT A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2017.1326224; SNIJDERS T, 2012; SPELLERBERG A, 2008; STENBERG P, 2002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VENKATESH V, 2000, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42",121,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000440288500012,ISI,UNIV ZURICH;UNIV ZURICH;UNIV ZURICH;HEIDELBERG UNIV,UNIV ZURICH,NA,"KONIG R, 2018, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC","KONIG R, 2018, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC",GERMANY;SWITZERLAND;SWITZERLAND;SWITZERLAND,10.1007/s10209-018-0609-5,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, CYBERNETICS; ERGONOMICS",122,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; GERMAN MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; MAX PLANCK SOCIETY FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE; US NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING [U01_AG09740-13S2, P01_AG005842, P01_AG08291, P30_AG12815, R21_AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG_BSR06-11, OGHA_04-064, HHSN271201300071C]",WOS

TOMSK. GOS. UNIV. FILOS.-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA,ARTICLE,BIG DATA; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; POLITICAL CONTROL; DIGITAL FRAMING,NA,"IN THE CONDITIONS OF ACTIVE INTRODUCTION OF A WIDE RANGE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES, INTO THE SPACE OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICS, THE TECHNOLOGICAL POTENTIAL IS FORMED, ACTING AS A POWERFUL FACTOR OF INFLUENCE ON TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PROCESSES. IN THIS REGARD, THE AIM OF THE WORK IS TO ANALYSE THIS POTENTIAL, AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL RISKS, THREATS AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATION OF BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICS. USING THE SCENARIO APPROACH, KEY CHALLENGES AND THREATS ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE ARTICLE, SUCH AS DIGITAL INEQUALITY AND THE EMERGENCE OF DATA-CLASSES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT CAPABILITIES FOR ACCESSING AND USING DIGITAL ARRAYS OF DATA. ANOTHER THREAT IS THE FORMATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL REGIMES CAPABLE OF PERFORMING TOTAL DIGITAL CONTROL OVER CITIZENS THROUGH THE USING OF INDIVIDUAL DIGITAL TRACES. AT THE SAME TIME, NOT ONLY STATE STRUCTURES BUT ALSO GLOBAL CORPORATIONS CAN BE INTERESTED IN CREATING SUCH REGIMES. ALSO, THE WORK IDENTIFIES SUCH A SIGNIFICANT THREAT AS THE FORMATION OF PERSONAL DIGITAL FRAMES AND VALUE-SEMANTIC CAPSULES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY, BASED ON THE SUBJECTIVE FEATURES OF THE PERCEPTION OF INDIVIDUALS, TO LIMIT IDEAS ABOUT THE SOCIO-POLITICAL REALITY OF CITIZENS, CUTTING THEM OFF FROM REALITY. WHEN IMPLEMENTING SUCH A SCENARIO, INDIVIDUALS WILL RECEIVE ONLY READY-MADE EXPLANATORY MODELS ADAPTED TO THEIR SUBJECTIVE PREFERENCES AND EXPECTATIONS BUT LIMITED BOTH IN THE ASPECT OF ILLUMINATING ONLY A SPECIFIC RANGE OF EVENTS, PHENOMENA AND PROCESSES AND IN THE ASPECT OF THEIR ""CORRECT"" INTERPRETATION CONTAINING SPECIFIC VALUE-SEMANTIC COMPONENTS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BOTH CONSTRUCTIVE AND NEGATIVE POTENTIAL IN TERMS OF INFLUENCING THE PROCESSES OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE PRIMARY VECTORS OF APPLICATION OF CONTEMPORARY TECHNOLOGIES FOR WORKING WITH DIGITAL DATA SETS AS WELL AS THE BALANCE OF INTERESTS OF VARIOUS ACTORS OF SOCIO-POLITICAL PROCESSES WILL BE FORMED IN REAL POLITICAL PRACTICE.","LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","VOLODENKOV, SV (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","BAKARDJIEVA M, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1043320; BOLSOVER G, 2017, DOI 10.1089/big.2017.29024.cpr; CHERNIKOVA V E, 2015; DRUZHININ A, 2017, DOI 10.7256/2409-8728.2017.1.18534; GOURLEY S, 2015; GRACHEV M N, 2018; KARPOVA A, 2017, DOI 10.17223/1998863x/40/11; KOSINSKI M, 2015, DOI 10.1037/a0039210; KOSINSKI M, 2013, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1218772110; MANOVICH L, 2015; ОДИНЦОВ АВ ODINTSOV A, 2017, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2017.3.04; PARENTI M, 1990; SOLOVEY V, 2017, DOI 10.17976/jpps/2017.05.09; VERSHININ M S, 2004; WATSON P J, 2013; ZHURAVLEVA Y, 2015",0,2018,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000448064000020,ISI,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,NA,"VOLODENKOV SV, 2018, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA","VOLODENKOV SV, 2018, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA",RUSSIA,10.17223/1998863x/44/20,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",1,TOMSK STATE UNIV,NA,WOS

BECAUSE, ESPECIALLY IN DYNAMICALLY GROWING CITIES, READY-TO-USE COMPREHENSIVE DATA SETS ON THE URBAN POOR, AS WELL AS ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ARE NOT EXISTENT, WE USE PROXIES: WE SPATIALLY DELIMIT THE URBAN POOR USING SETTLEMENT CHARACTERISTICS DERIVED FROM REMOTE SENSING DATA. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS TARGETED BY GEOLOCATED TWITTER DATA. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF EIGHT CITIES ACROSS THE GLOBE, WE SPATIALLY TEST WHETHER AREAS OF THE URBAN POOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DIGITAL COLD SPOTS. OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, WE ANALYZE WHETHER TEMPORAL SIGNATURES IN POOR URBAN AREAS DIFFER FROM FORMAL ENVIRONMENTS. WE FIND THAT THE ECONOMIC DIVIDE INFLUENCES DIGITAL PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC LIFE. LESS RESIDENTS OF MORPHOLOGICAL SLUMS ARE FOUND TO BE DIGITALLY ORIENTED (""ARE DIGITALLY LEFT BEHIND"") AS COMPARED TO RESIDENTS OF FORMAL SETTLEMENTS.

HOWEVER, INEQUALITIES RELATED TO THE LEVELS OF BROADBAND SOLUTIONS' DEPLOYMENT AND ADOPTION BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS, I.E., THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, REMAIN A CONSEQUENTIAL PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE DEPLOYMENT AND USAGE OF BROADBAND SOLUTIONS IN RURAL AREAS ARE ANALYSED IN THIS PAPER. TO DEFINE OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR THE DEPLOYMENT AND ADOPTION OF RURAL BROADBAND SOLUTIONS, THE APPLICATION OF AN EXTENDED TECHNO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS CONSIDERED. THEREFORE, AN ADDITIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT EXTENDS THE STRUCTURE OF STANDARD TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODELS IS PROPOSED, AND ITS DETAILED OVERVIEW IS GIVEN. WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK, THE REGRESSION ANALYSES OF FACTORS RELEVANT TO BROADBAND SOLUTIONS DEPLOYMENT AND ADOPTION IN RURAL AREAS ARE DEFINED. THE RESULTS OF CONDUCTED ANALYSES ARE USED IN THE STANDARD TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODELLING PROCESS. FINALLY, THE EFFICIENCY OF FRAMEWORK USAGE IN TECHNO-ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT PROCESS AND IN FINDING OPTIMAL BROADBAND SOLUTIONS IS DEMONSTRATED FOR A CASE STUDY RURAL SCENARIO.","JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK, FAC ELECT ENGN COMP SCI & INFORMAT TECHNOL, OSIJEK, CROATIA.","CIK, VK (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK, FAC ELECT ENGN COMP SCI & INFORMAT TECHNOL, OSIJEK, CROATIA.","ABBEY R, 2009, DOI 10.1108/14779960911004480; ANDRES L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.01.003; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.006; BOUCKAERT J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.09.001; CAMBINI C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.007; CHEN Y, 2011, DOI 10.1162/rest_a_00070; CIK V, 2016, DOI 10.17559/tv-20150508131935; CULLEN I, 2014; CZERNICH N, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2011.02420.x; FLAMM K, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.05.006; GOTZ G, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.03.001; GRIMES A, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s11123-011-0237-z; GRUBESIC T H, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2004.02.003; HARNO J, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s11235-009-9150-4; ITU I T, 2015; KELLY T, 2012, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8945-4; KIM Y, 2010, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8419-0; KOLKO J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jue.2011.07.004; KOUTROUMPIS P, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.07.004; KWAK N, 2004, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4803_5; LAAKSONEN P, 2011; LEE S, 2008; LEMSTRA W, 2015; LOO B, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.07.015; LUCIC D, 2015; ORVISKA M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2009.06.002; PERONARD J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.008; PRIEGER J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.01.001; PRIEGER J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.11.003; PUBLISHING O, 2010; RIFF A, 2011; ROSE L, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.004; SAVAGE S, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ijindorg.2008.06.001; SAVAGE S, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.06.001; SIGURDSSON H M, 2007; THE EUROPEAN C, 2013; TRINH T, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11235-010-9333-z; TSELEKOUNIS M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.06.001; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002; VERDEGEM P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2011.02.004; WOOD L, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.08.004; ZAGAR D, 2016",6,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000440288500006,ISI,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,JOSIP JURAJ STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK,NA,"CIK VK, 2018, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC","CIK VK, 2018, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC",CROATIA,10.1007/s10209-017-0560-x,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, CYBERNETICS; ERGONOMICS",6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,NA,WOS

THE RESEARCH RESULTS PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE ON THE DIFFERENCES AND DIGITAL DIVIDES. WHEN EXAMINING ICT SKILL LEVELS, THE ACCURACY OF ASSESSMENT IS ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES TO ADDRESS THE RESULTS AND GAIN THE APPLICABLE DATA FOR APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS TO ENHANCE DIGITAL INCLUSION. TO DATE, ICT SKILL ASSESSMENT IS BASED MAINLY ON SELF-REPORTS AND SUBJECTIVE EVALUATIONS. HOWEVER, AS PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN, PEOPLE TEND TO OVERRATE OR UNDERRATE THEIR OWN LEVELS OF COMPETENCE. THUS, NOVEL PERFORMANCE-BASED APPROACH FOR ASSESSING ICT SKILLS IS PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER. THE ICT SKILL TEST CONTAINS 42 TASKS GROUPED INTO 17 ICT FIELDS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH UPPER COMPREHENSIVE AND UPPER SECONDARY LEVEL SCHOOL STUDENTS (N = 3159) AND THEIR TEACHERS (N = 626) DURING YEARS 2014-2016 IN FINLAND. USING FACTOR ANALYSIS, THREE ICT SKILLS FACTORS WERE CREATED: BASIC DIGITAL SKILLS, ADVANCED TECHNICAL SKILLS, AND PROFESSIONAL ICT SKILLS. THE PERFORMANCE IN THE ICT SKILL TEST WAS ALSO DIVIDED BY GENDER, AS THE MALE STUDENTS AND TEACHERS OUTPERFORMED THE FEMALE STUDENTS AND TEACHER. OUTPERFORMANCE ALSO OCCURRED BY EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AS BOTH UPPER SECONDARY LEVEL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS WERE SEEN AS POSSESSING HIGHER-LEVEL ICT SKILLS THAN STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AT THE COMPREHENSIVE LEVEL. WE THUS ARGUE THAT TO COMPARE THE ICT SKILLS AND THE VALIDITY OF THE ASSESSMENTS, WE NEEDED TO ENSURE CONSISTENT ASSESSMENT FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO DIMINISH THE ICT SKILL GAP AMONG STUDENTS, INTERVENTIONS USING FORMAL EDUCATION ARE URGENTLY NEEDED, AND IN PARTICULAR, MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO BOTH TEACHER TRAINING AND IN-SERVICE TRAINING.","UNIV TURKU, RUSE, TURKU 20014, FINLAND.;  UNIV TAMPERE, SCH MANAGEMENT, TAMPERE 33014, FINLAND.","KAARAKAINEN, MT (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TURKU, RUSE, TURKU 20014, FINLAND.","AINLEY J, 2016, DOI 10.1080/08957347.2016.1209205; BINKLEY M, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2324-5_2; CALVANI A, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.004; CHRISTMANN A, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.jmva.2005.05.012; CLARO M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.004; ESHET-ALKALI Y, 2004, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2004.7.421; FERRARI A, 2014; FNBE, 2012; FNBE, 2004; FRAILLON J, 2020; GOODE J, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809343560; GUI M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389751; HAKKARAINEN K, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(00)00007-5; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.1002/asi.10166; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2013; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HATLEVIK O, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.019; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01411920902989227; ILOMAKI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/00313831.2011.576910; KIVINEN O, 2016, DOI 10.1080/03054985.2016.1194263; LITT E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813475424; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LIVINGSTONE S, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342697; MERRITT K, 2005; OECD, 2011; OECD, 2012, DOI 10.1787/9789264239555-en; SIDDIQ F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.edurev.2016.05.002; THOMPSON P, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.022; UMAR I, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.01.331; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2000; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VITELI J, 2013",33,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000434862700010,ISI,UNIV TURKU;UNIV TAMPERE,UNIV TURKU,NA,"KAARAKAINEN MT, 2018, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC","KAARAKAINEN MT, 2018, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC",FINLAND;FINLAND,10.1007/s10209-017-0553-9,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, CYBERNETICS; ERGONOMICS",33,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,UNIVERSITY OF TURKU,WOS

INFORM.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL INEQUALITY; EMOTIONAL SUPPORT; INTERGENERATIONAL SOLIDARITY; PROXY INTERNET USE; SOCIALIZING SUPPORT; SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS,OLDER-ADULTS USE; DIGITAL DIVIDE; GREAT-BRITAIN; SKILLS; INFORMATION; RELIABILITY; CHILDREN; VALIDITY; TECHNOLOGY; AFFECTION,"DIGITAL INEQUALITIES RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED A SET OF PRACTICES RELATED TO PEOPLE'S INTERNET USE THAT QUESTIONS THE BINARY DIVISION BETWEEN INTERNET USERS AND NON-USERS. IN PARTICULAR, AMONG OLDER ADULTS, A CONSIDERABLY LARGE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOT USING THE INTERNET BY THEMSELVES; RATHER, THEY ASK MEMBERS OF THEIR PERSONAL NETWORKS TO DO THINGS ONLINE FOR THEM THEY ""USE"" THE INTERNET BY PROXY. SINCE PREVIOUS RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ARE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF HELP WHEN IT COMES TO INTERNET USE, THE CURRENT PAPER INDICATES THAT THE NOTION OF INTERGENERATIONAL SOLIDARITY IS A SOUND CONCEPTUAL BASIS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS AND PROXY INTERNET USE AMONG INTERNET NON-USERS. NOTABLY, THE CONCEPT OF FUNCTIONAL SOLIDARITY AS A DIMENSION OF INTERGENERATIONAL SOLIDARITY IS ADVANCED, AS THIS RELATES TO THE FREQUENCY OF THE INTERGENERATIONAL EXCHANGE OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES ENCOMPASSING VARIOUS TYPES OF ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT OFFERED BETWEEN TWO GENERATIONS. EMPIRICALLY, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES HOW THE TWO TYPES OF SOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PROXY INTERNET USE. THE RESULTS FROM MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF SURVEY DATA FROM A NATION-WIDE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE SHOW THAT WHEN COMPARING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND SOCIALIZING NETWORKS, ONLY THE LATTER IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROXY INTERNET USE: INTERNET NON-USERS WHO HAVE (GRAND-)CHILDREN IN THEIR SOCIALIZING SUPPORT NETWORK ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN PROXY INTERNET USE. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT NON-USERS WHO ARE YOUNGER, MORE EDUCATED, HAVE CHILDREN, AND LIVE IN URBAN AREAS ARE MORE INCLINED TO ENGAGE IN PROXY INTERNET USE, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION RELATED TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF FUNCTIONAL SOLIDARITY, AS THE EFFECTS ON PROXY INTERNET USE DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT.","UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC SOCIAL SCI, KARDELJEVA PLOSCAD 5, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.","DOLNICAR, V (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC SOCIAL SCI, KARDELJEVA PLOSCAD 5, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.","ALBERTINI M, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0958928707081068; BAKARDJIEVA M, 2005; BENGTSON V, 2007; BENGTSON V, 1991, DOI 10.2307/352993; BLANK G, 2016; BLANK G, 2013; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BURT R, 1984, DOI 10.1016/0378-8733(84)90007-8; CORNWELL B, 2008, DOI 10.1177/000312240807300201; COROMINA L, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2005.07.006; CORREA T, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1461444813506975; COURTOIS C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814562162; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DUTTON W, 2013; DUTTON W, 2005; EUROSTAT, 2009; EUROSTAT, 2016; EYNON R, 2012; EYNON R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.942344; EYNON R, 2009, DOI 10.1080/17439880903345874; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GENIETS A, 2011; GONZALES A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1050438; GURUNG R, 2003, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.18.3.487; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1203454; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2012.0257; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HLEBEC V, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1461444806058166; HLEBEC V, 2004; HLEBEC V, 2006; HLEBEC V, 2010, DOI 10.1080/14616696.2010.483009; HLEBEC V, 2010; HORRIGAN J, 2010; HORST H, 2009; ITO M, 2009; KALMIJN M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.alcr.2012.08.002; KALTON G, 1983; KOGOVEK T, 2005; KOGOVSEK T, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2005.01.001; KOGOVSEK T, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0378-8733(01)00047-8; KORUPP S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/esr/jci030; LAWTON L, 1994, DOI 10.2307/352701; LITWAK E, 1985; LITWIN H, 2013; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MCCALLISTER L, 1978, DOI 10.1177/004912417800700202; MCPHERSON M, 2006, DOI 10.1177/000312240607100301; NEVES B B, 2012; NEVES B, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.11.002; NEVES B, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.2998; OFCOM, 2012; OFCOM, 2016; PARROTT T, 1999, DOI 10.1177/0164027599211004; PETROVCIC A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2015.02.005; PETROVI S, 2018; REISDORF B, 2012; REISDORF B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815621539; REISDORF B, 2011, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.543141; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1108/09593840410522170; SELWYN N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0267323105049631; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2016; SELWYN N, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.003; SHAW B, 2007, DOI 10.1093/geronb/62.2.s90; SPARKS C, 2013, DOI 10.1080/13183222.2013.11009113; SZYDLIK M, 2008, DOI 10.3138/jcfs.39.1.97; TOMINI F, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s12877-016-0362-7; TSATSOU P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2012.670190; TSATSOU P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0163443710393865; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN ROMPAEY V, 2002, DOI 10.1080/13691180210130770; VANDERPOEL M, 1993, DOI 10.1016/0378-8733(93)90021-c; VEHOVAR V, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2008.03.002; WEISS R, 1974, DOI ng others; WHITE P, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2011.611816; YU R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109695; ZHAO S, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.08.039; ZICKUHR K, 2014; ZICKUHR K, 2012; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",18,2018,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000427667600001,ISI,UNIV LJUBLJANA,UNIV LJUBLJANA,NA,"DOLNICAR V, 2018, TELEMAT INFORM","DOLNICAR V, 2018, TELEMAT INFORM",SLOVENIA,10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.005,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,19,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"SLOVENIAN RESEARCH AGENCY [Z5-8234, L5-7626, P5-0399]",WOS

THE STUDY IS BASED ON MEDIA LITERACY (ML) INDICATORS DIVIDED IN FIVE GENERAL CRITERIA DEFINED BY PEREZ-TORNERO AND CELOT (2009). THESE ARE: AVAILABILITY OF MEDIA, ML CONTEXT, USE, CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING, AND COMMUNICATION. THE INITIAL FRAMEWORKS WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE USED IN IN HIGHLY-REGARDED INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS A TEST BASED ON THE QUALITATIVE COMPARISON OF INTERNATIONAL EVALUATION METHODS, AS WELL AS THROUGH IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. THE PROPOSED TOOL IS APPLIED AND REFINED THROUGH A RESEARCH PROCESS THAT COMBINES QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS. THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT COMPETENCES CAN BE ASSESSED BY MEANS OF A QUESTIONNAIRE, BUT ALSO FINDS THAT THERE ARE OTHERS, ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATED TO THE CRITICAL READING OF INFORMATION, THAT PRESENT GREATER COMPLEXITY AND THAT DEMAND VARIOUS TYPES OF TESTS. THE APPLICATION OF THE SURVEY ALLOWS US TO OBTAIN USEFUL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF ML INDICATORS WITHIN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS.","UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, FAC CIENCIAS COMUNICAC, DEPT PERIODISMO & CIENCIAS COMUNICAC, BELLATERRA 08193, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","PEREZ-TORNERO, JM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, FAC CIENCIAS COMUNICAC, DEPT PERIODISMO & CIENCIAS COMUNICAC, BELLATERRA 08193, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","ABAD ALCALA L, 2014, DOI 10.3916/c42-2014-17; AGUADED-GOMEZ J, 2011; AINLEY J, 2012; AREA M, 2015; BUCKINGHAM D, 2014; CAPGEMINI C, 2007; CAPGEMINI C, 2012; CAPPELLO G, 2011; CONTRERAS-PULIDO P, 2014; COSTA-BADIA P, 2013; FERRES J, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c38-2012-02-08; FRAUMEIGS D, 2017; FUNDACION T, 2018; GIRALDO-LUQUE S, 2014; HEMANT C, 2010; HERMIDA M, 2017; HERNANDEZ-SAMPIERI R, 2006; HORROCKS IVAN J, 2010; LLORENTE-CEJUDO M, 2010; LOPEZ L, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c44-2015-20; MARGETTS H, 2002; MARTINEZ-CERDA J, 2014, DOI 10.3145/epi.2014.may.09; MEDINA A, 2015, DOI 10.4438/1988-592x-re-2015-369-293; MIHAILIDIS P, 2011; NG W, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.016; OBSERVATORIO AUDIOVISUAL E, 2017, DOI 10.2759/111731; PARK S, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1329878x1214200111; PEREIRA S, 2015; PEREZ M, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c39-2012-02-02; PEREZ-TORNERO J M, 2009; PEREZ-TORNERO J, 2015; PEREZ-TORNERO J, 2010; PETERS C S, 2010; PRATS J, 2007, DOI 10.3916/c29-2007-14; RIBEIRO PESSOA M, 2015; SARDI X, 2002; SUBIRATS J, 2013; TAYIE S, 2005; TILLEUL C, 2014; TUCHO F, 2015, DOI 10.4185/rlcs-2015-1066; UNESCO, 2013; UNESCO, 2011; VERGEZ C, 2010",3,2018,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000436175100006,ISI,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,NA,"PEREZ-TORNERO JM, 2018, PROF INF","PEREZ-TORNERO JM, 2018, PROF INF",SPAIN,10.3145/epi.2018.may.06,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,3, EDICIONES PROFESIONALES INFORMACION SL-EPI,NA,WOS

WHAT IS MEANT BY DD ARE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVELS OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENTERPRISES; BEING THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT THE DEGREE OF ADOPTION AND USE OF ICTS AND E-COMMERCE BY THE FIRMS. THE AIM OF THIS PIECE OF WORK IS TO CHARACTERISE AND MEASURE THE DD IN THE SPANISH REGIONS AND THOSE IN THE COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BASED ON THE DATA OF THEIR ENTERPRISES WITH MORE THAN 10 EMPLOYEES WHICH HAVE USED ICTS. THE METHODOLOGY IS DEVELOPED IN THE FOLLOWING STAGES: 1) CONSTRUCTION OF A SYNTHETIC INDEX OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT (ENTERPRISE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX-EDDI-) FOR COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND SPANISH REGIONS. THE PRODUCTION OF THIS INDEX IS CARRIED OUT BASED ON THE FACTORS OBTAINED WITH THE FACTOR ANALYSIS (FA) WITH THE AIM OF IDENTIFYING THE KEY VARIABLES WHICH DEFINE THE DIFFERENT EDDI COMPONENTS. THESE VARIABLES COME FROM THE ""COMMUNITY SURVEY ON ICT USAGE AND E-COMMERCE IN ENTERPRISES"" OF EUROSTAT 2) CLASSIFICATION OF SPANISH REGIONS INTO THE GROUPS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH A SIMILAR LEVEL OF EDDI COMPONENTS BASED ON THE DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS. THOSE GROUPS ARE PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED BY USING CLUSTER ANALYSIS. AND 3) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DD BETWEEN THE SPANISH REGIONS AND THOSE IN COUNTRIES OF THE EU BASED ON EDDI COMPONENTS AND THE IDENTIFIED GROUPS. THE STUDY PROVIDES A SYNTHETIC INDEX (EDDI) AT EUROPEAN SCALE COMPRISING 3 DIMENSIONS WHICH PERMITS OBTAINING: I) A RANKING FROM MORE TO LESS DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRIES AND REGIONS PERMITTING THE MEASUREMENT OF THE DD AMONG THEM IS ESTABLISHED; AND II) A TYPOLOGY OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND SPANISH REGIONS IS DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE 3 DIMENSIONS OF EDDI. THE MAIN RESULTS OF THIS PIECE OF WORK SHOW THAT THE SPANISH REGIONS AT ENTERPRISE LEVEL: I) ARE IN A MEDIUM OR HIGHER LEVEL OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT THAN THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS, PRESENTING, FURTHERMORE, A LOWER DD BETWEEN THEM IN RELATION TO WHAT HAPPENS IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; II) STAND OUT FOR HAVING A HIGHER DIGITAL INCLUSION THAN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN THE ICTS RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURES OF INTERNET ACCESS AND FOR THE INTERACTION WITH THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES; AND III) HAVE A DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT DEFICIT IN THE INTEGRATION OF ICTS FOR E-COMMERCE.","UNIV SEVILLE, C MARIA PADILLA S-N, SEVILLE 41004, SPAIN.","LUCENDO-MONEDERO, AL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SEVILLE, C MARIA PADILLA S-N, SEVILLE 41004, SPAIN.","BACH M, 2013, DOI 10.12821/ijispm010403; BARTHOLOMEW D, 2005; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BILLON M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/09654310701748009; BILLON M, 2017, DOI 10.1108/itp-05-2015-0098; BILLON M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2017.1280302; BILLON M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10290-016-0259-8; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00461.x; BOSE R, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2011.01.003; BROWN I, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2007.02.007; BRUNO G, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2010.534364; BUYYA R, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2008.12.001; CARLSSON B, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0048-7333(01)00138-x; CILAN C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.11.002; CIMOLI M, 2010; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; DUTTA S, 2011; EUROFOUND, 2012; EUROPEAN C, 2017; EUROPEAN C, 2017; EUROPEAN C, 2017; EUROPEAN C, 2015; EUROPEAN C, 2010; EUROPEAN U, 2015; EUROSTAT, 2017; EUROSTAT S, 2017; EUROSTAT STATISTIC E, 2017; FUNDECION COTEC PARA LA I, 2016; HERNANDEZ-ORTEGA B, 2009; HERNAUS T, 2012, DOI 10.1108/17465261211272148; HUGHES J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2007.01.001; MARENGHI P, 2012; MARTIN L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2014.978072; MOROZ M, 2017, DOI 10.1515/fman-2017-0014; NARDO M, 2005, DOI 10.1787/533411815016; OECD, 2008; PICK J, 2011, DOI 10.2753/mis0742-1222280103; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; VICENTE M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01615440903423245; ROVIRA S, 2013; SAISANA M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-985x.2005.00350.x; SANCHEZ-MORAL S, 2015; SCHLICHTER B, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.09.003; SOLIMAN F, 2003, DOI 10.1108/02635570310497594; SOMOZA-MEDINA X, 2017, DOI 10.12795/rea.2017.i34.10; SPURGE V, 2005, DOI 10.1108/14635780510626556; STAPLETON J, 1997; STEMBERGER, 2010, DOI 10.2478/v10305-012-0022-0; TRANOS E, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0969776409340866; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; CUERVO M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2006.05.001; VU K, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.02.008; WORLD B, 2012; YU L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0961000606070600; ZOROJA J, 2016, DOI 10.4067/s0718-18762016000100001; ZOROJA J, 2011",16,2018,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000432103100001,ISI,UNIV SEVILLE,UNIV SEVILLE,NA,"RUIZ-RODRIGUEZ F, 2018, TELECOMMUN POLICY","RUIZ-RODRIGUEZ F, 2018, TELECOMMUN POLICY",SPAIN,10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.007,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"SPANISH MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS [CSO2015-67662]",WOS

WHILE THE 1ST WAVE ENABLED MOBILE COMPUTING ON A BASIC LEVEL - INCLUDING BASIC CONNECTIVITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOBILE DEVICES - AND WHILE THE 2ND WAVE WAS TO A LARGE EXTENT ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOBILE CONTENT (FROM DIGITAL SERVICES AND APPS, TO SERVICES FOR STORING OUR DATA IN THE CLOUD), THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT THE 3RD WAVE OF MOBILE COMPUTING IS LESS TECHNOLOGY- DRIVEN, BUT RATHER ABOUT WHAT MOBILE COMPUTING CAN ENABLE, AND HOW MOBILE COMPUTING IS INCREASINGLY A GATEWAY TO SOCIETY AT LARGE. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THIS 3RD WAVE OF MOBILE COMPUTING, AND IN PARTICULAR ON WHAT THEY CALL AN INVERTED DIGITAL DIVIDE - A STATE WHERE THE MOBILE TECHNOLOGY IS IN PLACE FOR ITS USERS, BUT WHERE THERE IS NO ACCESS TO THE SERVICES IN SOCIETY THAT RELY ON MOBILE COMPUTING. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS DEMONSTRATE THIS INVERTED DIGITAL DIVIDE THROUGH A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES WHERE THEY SHOW HOW THIS PLAYS OUT FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHERE THIS IS VITAL IN A GLOBAL WORLD - E.G., VISITORS TO A COUNTRY SUCH AS TOURISTS, IMMIGRANTS AND EVEN PEOPLE APPLYING FOR ASYLUM. THE AUTHORS DISCUSS WHAT IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE AND THEY OUTLINE ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF MOBILE SERVICES. IN CONCLUDING THIS PAPER, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT ""DIGITAL INTEGRATION"" MIGHT SERVE AS A KEY NOTION FOR RESOLVING THESE ISSUES AS WE NOW ENTER THE 3RD WAVE OF MOBILE HCI.","UMEA UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT, UMEA, SWEDEN.","WIBERG, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UMEA UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT, UMEA, SWEDEN.","BENYON D, 2005; BODKER S, 2006; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; KLEINROCK L, 1996; KLING R, 1996; MENZIE D, 2004; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; SHNEIDERMAN B, 1987; SHRESTHA S, 2007; TAUBER M, 1996; WEISER M, 1991, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican0991-94; WIBERG C, 2003; WIBERG M, 2000; WIBERG M, 2001; WORLD B, 2017",1,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000431082900004,ISI,UMEA UNIV,UMEA UNIV,NA,"WIBERG M, 2018, INT J MOB HUM COMPUT INTERACT","WIBERG M, 2018, INT J MOB HUM COMPUT INTERACT",SWEDEN,10.4018/ijmhci.2018040103,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, CYBERNETICS",1,IGI GLOBAL,NA,WOS

MOREOVER, IT EXPLORES MOSIREEN'S INNOVATIVE ONLINE/OFFLINE DIGITAL ACTIVISM WHICH ENABLED FORMERLY MARGINALIZED PUBLICS TO ACCESS NEW MODES OF INFORMATION AND CHALLENGE ELITE-DRIVEN DISCOURSES, THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE ""DEMOCRATIZATION"" OF THE PUBLIC SPHERE.

THE ARTICLE PROVIDES A RICH CASE STUDY IN HOW IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLES AND QUESTIONS OF POWER ARE INTERPRETED WITHIN THE BROADER REALM OF EGYPTIAN CIVIL SOCIETY WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE POWER OF VISUAL PRODUCTION AND ITS EFFECT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL COUNTER-PUBLICS.

SCHOLARS SUGGEST THAT LOW COSTS TO DIGITAL ACTIVISM BROADEN PARTICIPATION AND CHALLENGE CONVENTIONAL COLLECTIVE ACTION THEORIES, BUT GIVEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT COST VARIATION ACROSS SOCIAL MOVEMENT ORGANIZATIONS FROM DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASSES. A FOCUS ON HIGH LEVELS OF DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT AND EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS LEAVES SCANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL CLASS ON DIGITAL MOBILIZATION PATTERNS AND EVERYDAY PRACTICES WITHIN AND ACROSS ORGANIZATIONS. THIS STUDY TAKES A FIELD-LEVEL APPROACH TO INCORPORATE ALL GROUPS INVOLVED IN ONE STATEWIDE POLITICAL ISSUE, THEREBY INCLUDING ORGANIZATIONS WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLASS COMPOSITIONS, FROM TEA PARTIES TO LABOR UNIONS. DATA COLLECTION SPANS ONLINE AND OFF-LINE DIGITAL ACTIVISM PRACTICES. WITH AN INDEX TO MEASURE DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT FROM AN ORIGINAL DATA SET OF OVER 90,000 ONLINE POSTS, FINDINGS SHOW DEEP DIGITAL ACTIVISM INEQUALITIES BETWEEN WORKING-CLASS AND MIDDLE/UPPER-CLASS GROUPS.

APPLYING A MIXED METHODS APPROACH, WE INVESTIGATE HOW LIKELY THE EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THESE NEW OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO BE MET. WE USED SEMI-STRUCTURE INTERVIEWS TO DRAW OUT WHAT EFFECTS PARTY MEMBERS THINK ONLINE PARTICIPATION WILL HAVE. WE THEN CONDUCTED A SURVEY ASKING MEMBERS ABOUT THEIR PLANS TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOUR. COMPARING EXPECTATIONS TO PROSPECTIVE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES, WE FIND THAT THE HIGH HOPES OF BOTH PARTY MEMBERS AND LEADERS-TO DRAW IN THOSE MEMBERS WHO CURRENTLY DO NOT ENGAGE-ARE LIKELY TO BE DISAPPOINTED. MEMBERS WHO ARE BETTER OFF, BETTER EDUCATED, AND ALREADY MORE ACTIVE, WILL LIKELY BENEFIT MORE THAN THOSE THE PARTY HOPES TO ENGAGE. WE ARGUE THAT THIS IS LINKED TO THE PREVAILING DIGITAL DIVIDE, AND THAT THOSE WHO ARE TARGETED FOR MORE PARTICIPATION NEED TO BE MORE ACTIVELY ADDRESSED TO ACHIEVE BROADER PARTICIPATION.","UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, SOCIAL SCI, SOUTHAMPTON, HANTS, ENGLAND.;  UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, ELECT & COMP SCI, SOUTHAMPTON, HANTS, ENGLAND.","THUERMER, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SOUTHAMPTON, SOCIAL SCI, SOUTHAMPTON, HANTS, ENGLAND.","ANFARA V, 2002, DOI 10.3102/0013189x031007028; ARAGON P, 2013; BOULIANNE S, 2009, DOI 10.1080/10584600902854363; BUNDNIS 90 / DIE G, 2015; BUSSE B, 2015, DOI 10.1111/1467-954x.12265; CANTIJOCH M, 2016, DOI 10.1111/1467-856x.12067; DAHL R, 1991; EMMER M, 2011; FERRO E, 2007; FIELD A, 2013; FLYVBJERG B, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1077800405284363; FRANKLAND E G, 2008; GERL K, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.149; GERMANY, 2010; GERMANY, 2004; GIBSON R, 2004; HALFORD S, 2010, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.499956; HARGITTAI E, 2008; HEIMRICH L, 2013; HEINRICH R, 2014; HEINRICH R, 2002; JENSEN J, 2013, DOI 10.1111/1467-9477.12008; KELLNER M, 2015; KELLNER M, 2014; KERR A, 2014, DOI 10.1111/bjir.12010; KOLLECK A, 2014; KORTE K, 2012; LUSOLI W, 2002, DOI 10.1080/13614570209516993; LUTZ C, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1293129; MARGOLIS M, 1997, DOI 10.1177/1081180x97002001006; MICHELS A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03003930.2010.494101; MORRELL M, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s11109-005-3076-7; NORRIS P, 2001; PATTON M, 1999; QUAN-HAASE A, 2016; REISDORF B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815621539; RUDZIO W, 2015; SMITH G, 2009, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511609848; STATISTISCHES BUNDESAMT (, 2017; SWITEK N, 2012; VISSERS S, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0894439310396485; VON ALEMANN U, 2012; VOWE G, 2014; WARD S, 2003, DOI 10.1093/pa/gsg108; WYATT S, 2003",0,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000474785000035,ISI,UNIV SOUTHAMPTON;UNIV SOUTHAMPTON,UNIV SOUTHAMPTON,NA,"THUERMER G, 2018, NA","THUERMER G, 2018, NA",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1145/3201064.3201069,978-1-4503-5563-6,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS; ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC",0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,EPSRC CENTRE FOR DOCTORAL TRAINING IN WEB SCIENCE INNOVATION [EP/L016117/1],WOS

THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE CITIZENS' CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH THE ESTONIAN ELECTRONIC ID USER SUPPORT AND TAKES A CLOSER LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THE USER SUPPORT PROVIDED TODAY. WE ARE LOOKING WHETHER TODAY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC ID IS SATISFACTORY ENOUGH FOR THE USERS. IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WILL ASK FOR OBJECTIVE REASONS WHY THE VOLUMES OF REQUESTS TO THE USER SUPPORT CHANNELS ARE INCREASING - THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 30% MORE USERS IN 2016 COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR, NEW USERS OF THE ELECTRONIC ID NEED MORE HELP THAN EARLIER, AND MAJOR SOFTWARE CHANGES HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF CALLS. ON THE BASIS OF THE SURVEY'S OUTCOME WE WILL RECOMMEND WHAT COULD BE DONE BY THE STATE TO BETTER CONTROL THE SITUATION. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO PROVIDE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE STATE FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF THE RESOURCES AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.","TELIA EESTI AS, MKT & BRAND DEPT, TALLINN, ESTONIA.;  TALLINN UNIV TECHNOL, LARGE SCALE SYST GRP, TALLINN, ESTONIA.;  PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS, TALLINN, ESTONIA.","MULDME, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TELIA EESTI AS, MKT & BRAND DEPT, TALLINN, ESTONIA.","ANSPER A, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-41488-6_9; ATKINSON C, 2013; DRAHEIM D, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44159-7_3; HEALTH ON THE NET F, 2016; KIMMO M, 2018; KOTKA T, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44159-7_1; MEIER A, 2012; PAIDE K, 2018; PAPPEL I, 2017; PAPPEL I, 2011; PAPPEL I P, 2012; POMERLEAU K, 2017; PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS, 2017; REIVART K, 2015; SOLVAK M, 2016; TEPANDI J, 2017; TSAP V, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-70004-5_33; WORLD BANK G, 2017; WORLD BANK GROUP W D, 2016",7,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; GOVERNMENT & LAW,WOS:000469101300004,ISI,TALLINN UNIV TECHNOL,A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"MULDME A, 2018, NA","MULDME A, 2018, NA",ESTONIA;ESTONIA;ESTONIA,978-1-5386-2519-4,978-1-5386-2519-4,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS; POLITICAL SCIENCE",7,IEEE,NA,WOS

THEREFORE, THE MAIN AIMS OF THE STUDY WERE TO: DETERMINE WHETHER THE INTERNET PROMOTES VALUES OF FRIENDSHIP, COOPERATION, CREATIVITY, HONESTY, EQUALITY, FREEDOM, RESPECT, RESPONSIBILITY AND SOLIDARITY; FIND OUT IF THE WEEKLY FREQUENCY OF INTERNET USE INFLUENCES STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE PROMOTION OF VALUES ON THE INTERNET AND THE IMPORTANCE THEY GIVE TO THEM DURING ONLINE COMMUNICATION WITH COLLEAGUES, FRIENDS AND RELATIVES. THIS STUDY FOLLOWS A QUANTITATIVE AND EXPLORATORY APPROACH WITH DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH PROCEDURES THROUGH SURVEY. THE MAIN DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUE USED WAS THE QUESTIONNAIRE. THE DATA WAS OBTAINED IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR OF 2016/2017, FROM A SAMPLE OF 724 HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS BELONGING TO TWO INSTITUTIONS, A PORTUGUESE ONE AND A SPANISH ONE. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONDENTS CONSIDER THAT THE INTERNET FREQUENTLY PROMOTES THE REFERRED VALUES. THE APPLICATION OF STATISTICAL TESTS LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN SEVERAL SITUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROMOTION AND THE PRESENCE OF VALUES ON THE INTERNET, NAMELY WITH REGARDS TO THE PROMOTION OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION AND TO THE PRESENCE OF VALUES OF FRIENDSHIP, COOPERATION, HONESTY, EQUALITY, FREEDOM, RESPECT AND SOLIDARITY.

MANAG.,ARTICLE,ORGANIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; INNOVATION; BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING,IMPLEMENTATION,"PURPOSE IN THE ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION (AEC) INDUSTRY, A DIGITAL DIVIDE EXISTS IN TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION BECAUSE SMES (WHO OFTEN FORM THE BULK OF AEC ORGANISATIONS IN MOST COUNTRIES) ARE THOUGHT TO BE LATE MAJORITY AND LAGGARDS IN THE ADOPTION OF BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING (BIM) TECHNOLOGY. LARGER ORGANISATIONS NOT SADDLED WITH FINANCIAL AND SOCIO-TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS BEING AMONG THE EARLY MAJORITY OR INNOVATORS. IT IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE ORGANISATIONS DIFFER IN THEIR SPEED OF BIM TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND THE RATIONALE FOR THIS DIFFERENCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND SUGGEST SOLUTIONS FOR BRIDGING THE GAP. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH USING MIXED RESEARCH METHOD, DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF OVER 240 GLOBAL RESPONDENTS AS WELL AS A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WITH NINE EXPERTS FOR WHICH STATISTICAL AND THEMATIC ANALYSES WERE USED, RESPECTIVELY. FINDINGS ORGANISATIONS CAN BE ZONED INTO LAYERS AND LEVELS OF BIM TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND THEIR SIZE IS NOT ALWAYS SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY ADOPT BIM. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS UNEQUAL ACROSS LAYERS/LEVELS AND LARGE ORGANISATIONS UTILISE TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS THE BIM MATURITY LEVELS DEPENDING ON PROJECT CIRCUMSTANCES. A CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR BIM TECHNOLOGY WAS DEVELOPED TO AID IDENTIFICATION OF THE LAGGARDS AND LATE MAJORITY FROM THE INNOVATORS THROUGH WHICH CHANGE AGENTS CAN CUSTOMISE ADOPTION STRATEGIES FOR EACH GROUP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE DEVELOPED MODEL COULD SERVE AS A TOOL FOR ENGAGEMENT AND POLICY MAKING AND IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF BIM TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION.","LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL & BLDG ENGN, LOUGHBOROUGH, LEICS, ENGLAND.;  BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIV, FAC COMP ENGN & BUILT ENVIRONM, BIRMINGHAM, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND.","AYINLA, KO (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL & BLDG ENGN, LOUGHBOROUGH, LEICS, ENGLAND.; AYINLA, KO (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIV, FAC COMP ENGN & BUILT ENVIRONM, BIRMINGHAM, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND.","ALWAN Z, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.12.085; BIM INDUSTRY WORKING G, 2011; CHEN Y, 2012; DAINTY A, 2015; GIEL B, 2012; HARVEY M, 2014; HM G, 2015; HM G, 2013; HSIEH S, 2012; KALE S, 2010, DOI 10.1061/(asce)co.1943-7862.0000134; KASSEM M, 2013; KHOSROWSHAHI F, 2012, DOI 10.1108/09699981211277531; MILES M, 1994; PANUWATWANICH K, 2013; ROGERS EVERETT M, 1983; SEXTON M, 2006, DOI 10.1080/09613210500254474; SINGH V, 2015, DOI 10.1108/ecam-09-2014-0124; SUCCAR B, 2010, DOI 10.4018/978-1-60566-928-1.ch004; SUCCAR B, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.autcon.2015.04.018; SUCCAR B, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.autcon.2008.10.003; TAHRANI S, 2015; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WIELICKI T, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0165551509354417; YAN H, 2008",47,2018,ENGINEERING; BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000447729600009,ISI,LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV TECHNOL;BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIV,LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV TECHNOL;BIRMINGHAM CITY UNIV,NA,"AYINLA KO, 2018, ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MANAG","AYINLA KO, 2018, ENG CONSTR ARCHIT MANAG",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/ecam-05-2017-0091,NA,"ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL; ENGINEERING, CIVIL; MANAGEMENT",47,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,NA,WOS

THE WORK PRESENTS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF INFORMATION REVOLUTION IMPLICATIONS. PRODUCTION RELATIONS IN THE SINGLE INFORMATION SPACE (BASED ON CLOUD TECHNOLOGY, BIG DATA, INFORMATION OPENNESS, AND SOCIAL NETWORKS) ARE OPPOSED TO THE DEEPENED DIGITAL DIVIDE. NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE, HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY ARE OPPOSED TO INNOVATION INEQUALITY AND DEEPENED ENVIRONMENTAL IMBALANCE. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES HELPED IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE ACTIVITIES IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, BUT THE GAP BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND THE REAL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY INCREASED. THE LEVEL OF ORGANIZATION ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO THE CONTINUITY OF DECISION-MAKING AND COMMUNICATIONS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE INTRODUCTION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES INCREASED THE BUREAUCRACY. STIFF COMPETITION OF INFORMATION COMPANIES IS COMBINED WITH THE RISK OF GLOBAL MONOPOLY. ON THE ONE HAND, THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION GAVE BROAD OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPING CREATIVE ACTIVITIES; WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND, IT HAS LED TO THE LOSS OF INTERNET USERS' SOCIAL MOBILITY.","KEMEROVO STATE UNIV, DEPT ECON THEORY & PUBL ADM, KEMEROVO, RUSSIA.","SHCHERBAKOVA, LN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KEMEROVO STATE UNIV, DEPT ECON THEORY & PUBL ADM, KEMEROVO, RUSSIA.","BRUNO A, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s11469-014-9497-y; BU Z, 2018; KOLGANOV A, 2014; KOLOZARIDI P, 2016; MILOVIDOV V, 2017, DOI 10.20542/0131-2227-2017-61-3-5-14; OECD, 2017; SHABANOVA M, 2015; SHABASHEV V, 2016; SHAPOVALOVA I, 2015; SHARIKOV A, 2016; VOLKOV V, 2016",0,2018,PSYCHOLOGY; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000448272100013,ISI,KEMEROVO STATE UNIV,KEMEROVO STATE UNIV,NA,"SHCHERBAKOVA LN, 2018, NA","SHCHERBAKOVA LN, 2018, NA",RUSSIA,978-94-6252-577-1,978-94-6252-577-1,"PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",0,ATLANTIS PRESS,NA,WOS

THE PAPER PRESENTS DATA FROM TWO STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN 2013 AND IN 2018 AND ATTEMPTS TO COMPARE SOME OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND ABILITIES OF THE PARENTS THAT THEY HAD AS ASSISTANTS AND EXPERTS HELPING THEIR CHILDREN TO EXPLORE THE INTERNET. THESE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN 8 FEDERAL DISTRICTS OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES: IN 2013 - 1203 ADOLESCENTS AGED 12-17 AND 1209 PARENTS; IN 2018 - 1554 ADOLESCENTS AGED 12-17 AND 1105 PARENTS. THE PAPER TRACES THE CHANGES IN THE DIGITAL PORTRAITS OF MODERN PARENTS AS INTERNET USERS, FOCUSING, IN PARTICULAR, ON THEIR AWARENESS OF THEIR CHILDREN'S ENCOUNTERS WITH ONLINE RISKS AND ON THE DYNAMICS OF PARENTAL MEDIATION STRATEGIES CONCERNING THE USE OF THE INTERNET.

LIBRARIES HAVE BEEN WORKING TO CLOSE THE GAP BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO COMPUTERS, THE INTERNET, DIGITAL CONTENT, AND DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, RESEARCH REVEALS A NEW TYPE OF DIVIDE WHERE DIGITALLY COMPETENT PEOPLE COULD BE DIGITALLY EXCLUDED. THIS SHOWS THE NEED FOR A BETTER CONCEPTUALIZATION OF ACCESS AND LITERACY. THIS PAPER COMMITS TO EXPLORING THE CONCEPT OF ACCESS TO DIGITAL CONTENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WITH PRINT DISABILITY.

THE TOPICALITY OF THE RESEARCH IS CONNECTED WITH THE FACT THAT THE INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION AND ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE HAS BECOME THE TENDENCY OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY OF THE XXI CENTURY. THE COMBINATION OF SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL METHODS AS WELL AS NETWORK AND INSTITUTIONAL APPROACHES HAS LAID THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY. THE AIM OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR TRAINING OF SPECIALISTS IN INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL AS WELL AS POLITICAL SPHERES. THE CERTAIN TASKS ARE SET AND SOLVED ACCORDING TO THE AIM OF THE INVESTIGATION, NAMELY: INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE AS THE MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCES AND CAPITAL OF THE COUNTRY'S DEVELOPMENT IN VARIOUS SPHERES OF SOCIETY ARE CONSIDERED; ICT AS A FACTOR OF THE STATE POLITICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBALIZATION PROCESS IS DEFINED; THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET USERS AND THE NEED OF PREPARING THE SOCIETY FOR THE NEW CONDITIONS OF LEARNING AND WORK IS ANALYZED; THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW ICT ON THE FORMATION OF NEW ELITES SUCH AS NETOCRACY AND INFOCRACY IS CHARACTERIZED; THE INFLUENCE OF INFORMATION AND DIGITAL GAP ON THE MODERN EDUCATIONAL MARKET AND THE NEED FOR TRAINING NEW STAFF FOR THE ANALYTICAL SECTOR, JOURNALISM, POLITICAL SPHERE, ETC. IS RESEARCHED; THE CONDITIONS OF IMPROVING THE LEVEL AND QUALITY OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPECIALISTS TRAINING OF THESE INDUSTRIES ARE DETERMINED AND THE CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE COUNTRY IS PROVED. THE THREATS AND PROBLEMS OF THE ICT DEVELOPMENT IN THE POLITICAL, INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL SPHERES ARE ALSO IDENTIFIED, NAMELY: THE PROBLEM OF PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CITIZENS (VULNERABLE GROUPS OF THE POPULATION); THE PROBLEM OF COMPUTER ILLITERACY OF THE POPULATION; THE THREAT OF PRIVATELY DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION FLOWS, SEIZING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY; INSUFFICIENT LEVEL OF COMPETENCES AND SKILLS RESULTING FROM INFORMATION INEQUALITY (OR INFORMATION / DIGITAL DIVIDE), ETC. IT IS EMPHASIZED THAT THE SHARE OF INDUSTRIES THAT PROVIDE THE CREATION, TRANSMISSION, PROCESSING AND USE OF INFORMATION IS GROWING RAPIDLY; THEREFORE, THE TOPIC OF TRAINING FOR THE INFORMATION AND POLITICAL SPHERES IS RELEVANT AND PROSPECTIVE.","LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV, POLIT SCI, LUTSK, UKRAINE.;  LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV, LUTSK, UKRAINE.;  LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV, DEPT INT COMMUN & POLIT ANAL, LUTSK, UKRAINE.","MYTKO, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV, POLIT SCI, LUTSK, UKRAINE.; MYTKO, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV, LUTSK, UKRAINE.; MYTKO, AM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV, DEPT INT COMMUN & POLIT ANAL, LUTSK, UKRAINE.","BARANOV A, 2002; BARD A, 2004; CHEKMISHEV O, 2004; CHEKMISHEV O, 1997; KHMELNITSKY O, 2007; MELESHCHENKO O, 1993; MYTKO A, 2015; MYTKO A, 2011; MYTKO A, 2013; MYTKO A, 2014; NEDBAY V, 2009; NEDBAY V, 2009; PIGOLENKO I, 2007; RIZUN V, 1992; RIZUN V, 2001; RUBAN V, 2012; SHEVCHUK O, 2001",1,2018,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000437531900021,ISI,LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV;LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV;LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV,LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV;LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV;LESIA UKRAINKA EASTERN EUROPEAN NATL UNIV,NA,"MYTKO AM, 2018, INF TECHNOL LEARN TOOLS","MYTKO AM, 2018, INF TECHNOL LEARN TOOLS",UKRAINE;UKRAINE;UKRAINE,10.33407/itlt.v65i3.2004,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,1,"NATL ACAD PEDAGOGICAL SCIENCES UKRAINE, INST INFO TECHNOL & LEARNING TOOLS",NA,WOS

GOV.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; ACCOUNTABILITY AS A VIRTUE AND AS A MECHANISM; BROADBAND DEVELOPMENT; PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY OF TELECOMMUNICATION; SPECTRUM GOVERNANCE,PUBLIC-EXPENDITURE; CORRUPTION; TELECOM; STATE,"PURPOSE THE PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE ACCOUNTABILITY AS A VIRTUE AND AS A MECHANISM (BOVENS, 2010) OF GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATION OPERATORS IN THE PROCESS OF GOVERNING SPECTRUM AND OF BROADBAND DEVELOPMENT. THE TWO CONCEPTS OF ACCOUNTABILITY ARE JUXTAPOSED WITH OPERATORS' CORPORATE REPORTING PRACTICES AND SPECTRUM LICENSING PROCEDURES OF EUROPEAN NATIONAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES (NRAS) AND ARE ANALYSED ACCORDINGLY. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT SPECTRUM LICENSING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION REGULATORY CONTEXT OFFERS POSSIBLE VENUES FOR POLICY INTERVENTION, RENDERING TELECOM PROVIDERS TO TAKE AN ACCOUNT ON THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. CORRUPTION IS THE CASE STUDY TO DRAW CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY, WITH A FOCUS ON THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY GLOBAL MARKET ACTIVITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH SPECTRUM BIDDING PROCESSES OF EUROPEAN NRAS WERE ANALYSED ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED DOCUMENTATION OF AUCTIONS AND TO ANSWERS OF NRAS ON SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF THEIR LICENSING PRACTICES. AUCTIONING CASES ON 800 MHZ BAND FREQUENCIES (790-862 MHZ, OR THE DIGITAL DIVIDEND) WERE SELECTED IN COUNTRIES WHERE TELECOMS INVOLVED IN CORRUPTION CASES WERE BASED OR WHERE CORRUPT PRACTICES WERE REVEALED. FURTHERMORE, A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN 08 MARCH AND 03 JUNE 2017 - COORDINATED BY THE RADIO SPECTRUM POLICY GROUP AMONG ITS 28 MEMBERS - ON INQUIRING ABOUT LICENSING PRACTICES OF NRAS DURING SPECTRUM TRADING WITH RESPECT TO IDENTIFYING BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF BIDDERS TO SPECTRUM. FINDINGS FINDINGS SHOW THAT EUROPEAN NRAS ARE IN POSSESSION OF REGULATORY TOOLS THAT COULD ENFORCE TELECOMS' PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY; THERE ARE STRONG ARGUMENTS ON THE NEED FOR EUROPEAN AND NATIONAL-LEVEL POLICY INTERVENTIONS. SPECTRUM LICENSING PROCEDURES ARE OFFERING POSSIBLE AND POTENTIAL VENUES OF ACCOUNTABILITY. FURTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS NECESSARY TO ADOPT A MINIMUM SET OF CRITERIA APPLICABLE IN THE LICENSING PROCESS. HARMONISED IMPLEMENTATION BY NRAS SHOULD FURTHER DEVELOP NEW STANDARDS FOSTERING TRANSPARENCY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR AND CORRUPTION OF EUROPEAN TELECOM OPERATORS IS SURPRISINGLY SCARCE AND UNSYSTEMATIC, PARTICULARLY CONSIDERING THE CENTRALITY OF THOSE ACTORS IN ADVANCING A NUMBER OF THE AIMS OF THE HISTORICAL MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE NEW SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

SIMILARLY, THE PAPER AIMS TO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND, FROM A VALUE-CREATION PERSPECTIVE, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DD AND BD GENERATION AND BETWEEN DD AND SCM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE APPROACH UTILIZED IN THE PRESENT STUDY CONSISTS OF TWO STEPS: FIRST, A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AIMING AT FINDING OUT TO DETERMINE THE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIG DATA ANALYTICS (BDA), SCM AND THE DD. A TOTAL OF 595 ARTICLES WERE CONSIDERED, AND ANALYSIS SHOWED A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP AMONG BDA, SCM, AND DD. NEXT, THE VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE (VAR) APPROACH WAS APPLIED IN A CASE STUDY TO PROVE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DD (AS PART OF INTERNET USAGE) AND INTERNET ACQUISITIONS, AND IN GENERAL TERMS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DD AND TRADE. INTERNET USAGE AND INTERNET ACQUISITION IN IMPORTS AND EXPORTS AT THE EUROPEAN LEVEL WERE CONSIDERED AS VARIABLES IN AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF EUROPEAN TRADE. THE NOVELTY OF THIS TWO-TIERED APPROACH CONSISTS IN ITS APPLICATION OF A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW, THE FIRST OF ITS KIND, TO GENERATE INPUTS FOR THE LONGITUDINAL CASE STUDY OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS AT THE EU LEVEL. IN TURN, THE CASE STUDY TESTED THE ACCURACY OF THE THEORIZED RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE MAIN VARIABLES. FINDINGS BY ANALYZING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DD AND INTERNET ACQUISITIONS, A POSITIVE AND LONG-LASTING IMPULSE RESPONSE FUNCTION WAS REVEALED, FOLLOWED BY AN ASCENDING TREND. THIS SUGGESTS THAT A SELF-MULTIPLYING EFFECT IS BEING GENERATED, AND IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE MORE INDIVIDUALS USE THE INTERNET, THE MORE ELECTRONIC ACQUISITIONS OCCUR. WE CAN THUS REASONABLY CONCLUDE THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE BD AND SCM PROCESS IS STRONGLY DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY OF THE HUMAN FACTOR. TACKLING DA IS THE NEW READING KEY IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS: QUANTIFYING THE ADDED VALUE OF THE HUMAN FACTOR IN SCM IS CHALLENGING AND IS AN ONGOING PROCESS, BASED ON THE OPPORTUNITY COST BETWEEN AUTOMATION IN DECISION-MAKING OR RELYING ON THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN FACTORS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIMITS IN OUR RESEARCH IS THE LACK OF THE TIME SERIES AVAILABLE ON CONSUMER ORIENTATIONS AND PREFERENCES. DATA ON THE TYPOLOGY OF CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, AND HOW THEY ARE SHAPED, MODIFIED, OR ALTERED, WERE NON-ACCESSIBLE, THOUGH BIG COMPANIES MAY HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA. THE PRESENT LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON EUROPEAN TRADE HELPS CLARIFY HOW AND TO WHAT EXTENT BDA, SCM, AND DD ARE INTER-RELATED. THE MODELING OF THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK LIKEWISE HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL IDENTIFIABLE BENEFITS FOR COMPANIES OF ADOPTING BDA IN THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS UNDERSTANDING THE OBSTACLES TO DD IN TRADE COMPANIES AND STATES, AND IDENTIFYING THEIR INFLUENCE ON FIRM PERFORMANCE, SERVES TO ORIENT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN SCM TOWARD REDUCING DD TO GENERATE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC BENEFITS. ENHANCING INTERNET USAGE MAY ACCELERATE LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN RESOURCES, OFFERING DEVELOPING COUNTRIES UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE THEIR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS AND TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES, WIDENING THE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND POOR STATES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS BD GENERATION WILL UNDENIABLY INFLUENCE MICROECONOMIC DECISIONS: THEY WILL BECOME EVALUATION TOOLS OF MORE EFFICIENT ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN SMALL AND/OR LARGE ECONOMIES. HOWEVER, AN ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT SOCIETY WILL BE ACHIEVABLE ONLY IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH QUALIFIED HUMAN RESOURCES CAN GENERATE AND MANAGE BD, TO UNLOCK ITS POTENTIAL. THIS TWOFOLD EFFECT WILL SURELY AFFECT THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL SITUATION. THE ECONOMIC PROGRESS OF CONVENTIONAL COUNTRIES MAY VACILLATE IF IT IS NOT ADEQUATELY FLANKED BY QUALIFIED HUMAN RESOURCES ABLE TO PROGRESS THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) PREVALENT IN CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF INVESTMENTS IN ICT CAPACITY BUILDING WILL NECESSARILY AFFECT FUTURE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SCENARIOS. NEW INDICATORS WILL BECOME NECESSARY TO MEASURE THE CONVENTIONAL PROGRESS, AND ONE OF THEM WILL SURELY BE DD. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE NOVELTY OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TWOFOLD: FIRST, IT IS THE FIRST METICULOUS META-ANALYSIS DEVELOPED USING A VERY WIDE ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE TO HIGHLIGHT A PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN RELATIONSHIP AMONG DD, BD, AND SCM.

WE EXAMINE WHETHER SOMETHING SIMILAR OCCURS ON THE INTERNET, WHETHER THE HIGHER EDUCATED ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN MOBILIZING HELP ONLINE, AND WHETHER THIS IS RELATED TO THEIR DIGITAL SKILLS AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USE THE INTERNET. WITH THE LATTER, WE LINK ONLINE COPING TO DIGITAL INEQUALITY RESEARCH. RESEARCHERS HAVE INVESTIGATED DIGITAL INEQUALITIES WITH REGARD TO SKILLS AND TYPES OF INTERNET USE. HOWEVER, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE FACTORS TRANSLATE INTO INEQUALITIES IN RESOURCES MOBILIZED FROM THE INTERNET. THIS LATTER TYPE OF INEQUALITY IS HIGHLY RELEVANT, SINCE IT IS AN INTERMEDIARY STEP BETWEEN INTERNET USE AND (IMPROVED) WELLBEING AND LIFE CHANCES. USING A LARGE SAMPLE OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE NETHERLANDS, WE FIND EDUCATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE MOBILIZATION OF ONLINE PROBLEM-FOCUSED COPING RESOURCES, BUT NO DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO ONLINE SOCIOEMOTIONAL OR DISENGAGEMENT COPING RESOURCES. THE EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES IN ONLINE COPING ARE SOMEWHAT SMALLER THAN EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES IN OFFLINE COPING, LEADING TO REMARKABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIAL POLICY. FURTHERMORE, WE FIND A RELATIVELY COMPLEX PATTERN OF INTERRELATIONS BETWEEN OFFLINE INEQUALITY (EDUCATION) AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY (SKILLS, USAGE, RESOURCES).

PARRA G,DIGITAL DIVIDE AND COGNITIVE DIVIDE: INEQUALITIES AND LEARNING DIFFICULTIES IN THE INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY,"11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI2018)",NA,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,DIGITAL DIVIDE; COGNITIVE DIVIDE; EDUCATION; ICT; KNOWLEDGE,NA,"THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CONCEPT IS ONE OF THE FIRST WHICH APPEARED TO LINKED ICTS AND LEARNING. AS THE NAME SAYS, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE NAMES THE DIFFERENCES CREATED BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO USE ICTS IN THEIR LIFE, FROM THOSE WHO CANNOT. AS A CONSEQUENCE, TWO GROUPS HAVE BEEN CREATED: DIGITALLY ALPHABETIZED AND NON- DIGITALLY ALPHABETIZED. THE BIGGEST DANGER OF THIS TENDENCY LAYS IN THE DEEP WORRY WHICH WE ALL HAVE RELATED TO THE PROFOUND INEQUALITIES, BOTH SOCIAL AND ECONOMICS, WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. NEVERTHELESS, THIS CONCEPT IS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHICH NEEDED ATTENTION. THE TIME AND EVOLUTION OF DIGITAL SOCIETY HAVE REVEALED THAT CONSEQUENCES OF DIGITAL DIVIDE HAVE CAUSED THE APPEARANCE OF ANOTHER DIVIDE KNOWN AS COGNITIVE DIVIDE. THIS SECOND DIVIDE DOES NOT MAKE REFERENCE ONLY TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE WHICH HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FROM THOSE WHO DO NOT. THE DIFFERENCES WHICH COGNITIVE DIVIDE CAUSES ARE RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY TO INCREASE THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN AND IMPROVE THEIR SITUATION, FROM THOSE WHO DO NOT. ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE TOPIC, THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE COGNITIVE DIVIDE HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED ADEQUATE ATTENTION. IN THE WORLD WE ARE LIVING IN, THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO END WITH THE DIFFERENCES AMONG PEOPLE, HAVE ACTUALLY CAUSED THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. ELDER PEOPLE, IMMIGRANTS, WOMEN, ETC. ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TWO DIVIDES, AND THE LACK OF ABILITY IN THE USE OF ICTS. MOREOVER, THE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCIETY AND THE GAPS CREATED SHOW THAT IN MANY CASES THE PROBLEM IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY THE TECHNOLOGY, BUT THE KNOWLEDGE. APPARENTLY, BOTH DIVIDES OF DIFFERENTIAL USE OF INTERNET ARE RELATED WITH A GREAT KNOWLEDGE GAP WHICH IS CAUSING MANY PROBLEMS TO PEOPLE. IN THE PRESENT WORK, WE WILL ANALYZE THE TWO DIVIDES TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEM. TO DO SO, WE WILL EXPLAIN IN DETAIL THE TWO CONCEPTS MAKING A REVISION OF DIFFERENT WORKS PUBLISHED. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND HOW BOTH CONCEPTS AFFECT PEOPLE, WE HOPE TO FIND A WAY TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM WHICH SHOULD BE FACED BY ALL THE SOCIETY.","UNIV EXTREMADURA, BADAJOZ, SPAIN.","PARRA, GMM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV EXTREMADURA, BADAJOZ, SPAIN.","CAMACHO K, 2005; CUADRADO I, 2008; LANKSHEAR C, 2010; RUIZ I, 2010; SANCHO J, 2010",0,2018,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000568991701077,ISI,UNIV EXTREMADURA,UNIV EXTREMADURA,NA,"PARRA GMM, 2018, NA","PARRA GMM, 2018, NA",SPAIN,978-84-09-05948-5,978-84-09-05948-5,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,NA,WOS

WHEREAS DIGITAL DIVIDE LITERATURE SIGNALS THAT THE USE AND OUTCOMES OF GOVERNMENTAL ONLINE SERVICES ARE STRATIFIED, THERE IS LESS COMPELLING EVIDENCE REGARDING HOW SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES AFFECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF C2G INTERACTIONS. SEVERAL E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT TYPOLOGIES ASSUME THAT AS SERVICES IMPROVE, THE TYPES OF INTERACTIONS THEY ENABLE BECOME MORE COMPLEX. THIS STUDY ANALYSES HOW SIMILAR SOCIOECONOMIC AND DIGITAL ATTRIBUTES AFFECT THREE DIFFERENT STAGES OF E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT (ENHANCED, INTERACTIVE AND TRANSACTIONAL) BY ASSESSING THE CHANCES OF INTERNET USERS TO A) SEARCH FOR INFORMATION, B) DOWNLOAD FILES, FORMS OR RECEIPTS, AND C) PAY ONLINE FOR SERVICES. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE EFFECTS OF DIGITAL DISPARITIES ARE PROGRESSIVE ON SUCCESSIVE MORE COMPLEX TYPES ON C2G INTERACTIONS. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 18 YEARS AND OLDER URUGUAYAN INTERNET USERS, BASED ON THE EUTIC 2016 SURVEY. THREE BINARY LOGISTIC MODELS ARE FITTED (ONE PER TYPE OF INTERACTION), TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIOECONOMIC ATTRIBUTES AND DIGITAL DIVIDES. FINDINGS SHOW THAT ADULTS TEND TO ENGAGE MORE IN ALL INTERACTIONS THAN YOUNG AND OLDER PEOPLE, BUT THE GENDER DIVIDE IS ONLY SIGNIFICANT FOR INFORMATION SEEKING. EVIDENCE FOR OUR HYPOTHESES AS A WHOLE WAS INCONSISTENT. ON ONE HAND THE EFFECT OF EDUCATION IS SIGNIFICANT IN THE ENHANCED AND INTERACTIVE LEVELS ONLY, WHEREAS-ON THE OTHER AND IN LINE WITH OUR HYPOTHESIS-INCOME IS STATISTICALLY RELEVANT ONLY FOR THE TRANSACTIONAL STAGE. REGARDING DIGITAL DIVIDE, INTERNET SENIORITY IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THE FIRST TWO STAGES AND FREQUENCY OF USE (DAILY) IS NOT FOR ANY OF THEM. THE EFFECT OF DIGITAL SKILLS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND MORE STABLE PREDICTORS ACROSS THE THREE C2G ACTIVITIES, SLIGHTLY INCREASING ITS AFFECT WITH FOR EACH STAGE OF E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT. THE DOCUMENT ENDS STRESSING THE NEED OF EVIDENCE-INFORMED PUBLIC POLICIES THAT CONSIDER HOW THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SERVICES INTERACT WITH SOCIAL AND DIGITAL DISPARITIES TO IMPROVE ITS UPTAKE. NONETHELESS, DIGITAL LITERACY APPEARS TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL FACTOR FOR E-GOVERNMENT UPTAKE AS A WHOLE.","UNIV CATOLICA URUGUAY, COMMUN DEPT, AV 8 OCTUBRE 2738, MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY.;  UNIV ERFURT POSTFACH, FAC ECON LAW & SOCIAL SCI, WILLY BRANDT SCH PUBL POLICY, D-99105 ERFURT, GERMANY.","DODEL, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CATOLICA URUGUAY, COMMUN DEPT, AV 8 OCTUBRE 2738, MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY.","AL-HASHMI A, 2008; BELANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY AND T, 2002; DODEL M, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2910019.2910052; EBBERS W, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2016.08.007; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; UNPAN, 2016; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002; VAN DIJK J, 2007",9,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000515826000057,ISI,UNIV CATOLICA URUGUAY;UNIV ERFURT POSTFACH,UNIV CATOLICA URUGUAY,NA,"DODEL M, 2018, NA","DODEL M, 2018, NA",GERMANY;URUGUAY,10.1145/3209415.3209475,978-1-4503-5421-9,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION",9,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NA,WOS

WHAT ARE THE TRENDS AND MOST INFLUENTIAL FACTORS IN DIGITAL DIVIDE? TO ANSWER THESE TWO QUESTIONS, THE PAPER USES ITU DATA FOR 209 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015. THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE KEY REASON FOR THE PERSISTENT DIGITAL DIVIDE SEEN BETWEEN REGIONS, COUNTRIES AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROUPS IS A FINANCIAL ONE! A DEEP DIVE CORRELATION ANALYSIS FINDS DIRECT CAUSATION BETWEEN THE VARIABLE TESTED, I.E. PHYSICAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET (I.E. INPUT FACTOR) AND USE OF INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SERVICES (I.E. OUTPUT FACTOR). MOBILE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FOUND TO INITIALLY PROVIDE BETTER VALUE AND FASTER ROLL-OUT OF PHYSICAL ACCESS TO INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT MAY NOT BE A LONG-TERM SOLUTION AS THE ACTUAL USE OF INTERNET-BASED SERVICES WILL LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR HIGH-QUALITY BANDWIDTH. THE RELATIVE COST OF INTERNET ACCESS IS A KEY CHALLENGE TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN LOWER INCOME AND HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. BY COMPARISON, THERE IS ONLY A LIMITED DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN LOW- AND HIGH-INCOME GROUPS AND RURAL AND URBAN AREAS IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ONCE ROUGHLY HALF OF A POPULATION HAS PHYSICAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, ACTUAL USE OF INTERNET-BASED SERVICES REACH A TIPPING POINT AND WILL AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE, THUS LENDING SUPPORT TO TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODELS.","UNITED NATIONS UNIV, EGOV, RUA VILA FLOR 166, P-4810445 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL.","NIELSEN, MM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNITED NATIONS UNIV, EGOV, RUA VILA FLOR 166, P-4810445 GUIMARAES, PORTUGAL.","AKER J, 2010; BARBOUR R, 2001, DOI 10.1136/bmj.322.7294.1115; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; COLLIER D, 1996, DOI 10.1353/wp.1996.0023; ERNESTJONES T, 2008; G20 GERMANY- WOMEN D, 2017; GORDON A A, 2013; LEGRIS P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00143-4; MARISCAL J, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.03.004; MASLOW A, 1943, DOI 10.1037/h0054346; NEGREIRO M, 2015; NIELSEN MORTEN M, 2016; NIELSEN M M, 2016; NORRIS P, 2001; NTSEBEZA L, 1995; PHILIP L, 2017; RAFFERTY C, 1999; ROHLFING I, 2012; SCHWAB K, 2016; SIMPLYPSYCHOLOGY, 2017; SRIDHAR K S, 2004; SRIDHAR K S, 1991; SRINUAN C, 2010; UNITED N, 2017; VAN DIJK J, 2012; VENKATESH V, 2016; YIN R, 2013",6,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000515826000076,ISI,UNITED NATIONS UNIV,UNITED NATIONS UNIV,NA,"NIELSEN MM, 2018, NA","NIELSEN MM, 2018, NA",PORTUGAL,10.1145/3209415.3209493,978-1-4503-5421-9,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION",6,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"NORTE PORTUGAL REGIONAL OPERATIONAL PROGRAMME (NORTE 2020), UNDER THE PORTUGAL 2020 PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, THROUGH THE EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND (EFDR) [NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000037]",WOS

MODERN TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW CONVERTING HUGE ARRAY OF DIGITAL DATA INTO SOCIETALLY VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE. WHICH ONLY HAPPENS, HOWEVER, WHEN THESE DATA ARE COLLECTED, STORED AND PROCESSED BY BUSINESSES. AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL ADVANTAGES TO ECONOMIC SUBJECTS DEPENDS ON THE INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT AND ITS CONFORMITY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF DIGITAL ECONOMY. THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO FIND HOW REQUIREMENTS FOR INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT ARE CHANGED. INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT IS CONSIDERED FROM THREE PROSPECTS: IT-INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES, EDUCATION. DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF THE ECONOMY INDICATE ITS FURTHER GLOBALIZATION RESULTING IN FAST SPREAD OF INNOVATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THUS, THE STUDY INVOLVED INDICATORS THAT CHARACTERIZED THE STATE OF INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT IN INTERNATIONAL CROSS-SECTION. AS OFFICIAL STATISTICS ESTIMATES FOR INNOVATION ACTIVITY HAVE NOT DEMONSTRATED ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM, INTERNATIONAL PATENT DATA (INVENTIONS, UTILITY MODELS, INDUSTRIAL SAMPLES, TRADEMARKS) HAVE BEEN USED AS INDICATORS OF INNOVATION ACTIVITY RESULTS. BASED ON CORRELATION ANALYSIS, THOSE INDICATORS HAVE BEEN SELECTED THAT ARE MOST STRONGLY RELATED TO INNOVATION ACTIVITY RESULTS. FOR IT INFRASTRUCTURE, THE INDICATOR OF CONSUMPTION OF COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES BY COUNTRIES HAS BEEN CONSIDERED. TO CHARACTERIZE INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES, INTERNATIONAL PATENT DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN USED. FOR ESTIMATION OF IMPACT OF A HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM, A NUMBER OF TOP HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTED IN THE INTERNATIONAL RANKING OF 1000 UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED. OBTAINED RESULTS SHOW THAT INNOVATION ENVIRONMENT OF DIGITAL ECONOMY IS A DISTRIBUTED INFORMATION NETWORK WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND DIGITAL DATA COLLECTION POINTS. FOR ITS SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS, SUFFICIENT COMPUTING CAPACITY AND HIGH-SPEED DATA TRANSMISSION CHANNELS NEED TO BE PROVIDED. AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT OF GLOBAL INFORMATION SOCIETY, A SMALL GROUP OF COUNTRIES HAVE MANAGED TO CREATE INTELLECTUAL ASSETS NEEDED FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT (SOFTWARE, DIGITAL PLATFORMS), AND THESE COUNTRIES ACT AS PROVIDERS OF THE INTELLECTUAL COMPONENT OF IT IN THE WORLD ARENA. AT THE SAME TIME, THE OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME CONSUMERS OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. FOR THE INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY SPACE BEING ESTABLISHED TO BE USED FOR CREATION OF GLOBAL INNOVATIONS INSIDE THE COUNTRY, DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL ASSETS AND TRAINING OF SPECIALISTS NEED TO BE PROVIDED. OTHERWISE, OPPORTUNITIES OF DIGITIZATION OF ECONOMY INSIDE THE COUNTRY WILL BE USED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES.

THIS SUBMISSION MAKES THE CASE FOR WHY THE ISSUE OF `DEVELOPMENT' SHOULD BE STUDIED IN MORE DETAIL IN E-GOVERNMENT RESEARCH AND AIMS TO CLARIFY THE CONCEPTUALIZATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF 'DEVELOPMENT' AS IT PERTAINS TO THE USE OF ICTS IN THE DIGITAL GOVERNMENT DOMAIN, DRAWING UPON LITERATURE IN TWO RELATED RESEARCH DOMAINS: DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ICT FOR DEVELOPMENT (ICT4D). E-GOVERNMENT RESEARCH CURRENTLY CUTS SHORT AT UNDERSTANDING FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF E-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES AND TENDS TO CONVERSE AROUND THE CONCEPT OF 'DEVELOPMENT' AT A GENERAL LEVEL. THE LITERATURE IN DIGITAL DIVIDE AND ICT4D OVERCOMES SOME OF THE PERCEIVED SHORTCOMINGS OF THE E-GOVERNMENT LITERATURE, LARGELY THE ISSUE OF DEVELOPMENT IN RELATION TO CITIZENS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING CONTEXT IN MORE DETAIL. BY UNDERTAKING RESEARCH USING A CASE STUDY APPROACH WITHIN THE UK AND TANZANIA, THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL HELP TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF E-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES ON CITIZENS' DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEYOND THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE. SUCH UNDERSTANDING IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE VERY GOALS OF E-GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES ARE REALISED IN RELATION TO THE CONTEXT IN WHICH INITIATIVES ARE DEPLOYED. BY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE E-GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE WHAT DEVELOPMENT EQUATES TO AND HOW IT COULD POSSIBLY BE MEASURED CAN HELP IN THE DESIGN AND ROLLOUT OF FUTURE INITIATIVES AND CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE POSITIVE STEPS TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE UN'S MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS.","NOTTINGHAM BUSINESS SCH, NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND.;  EMARC, SCH MANAGEMENT, CRANFIELD, BEDS, ENGLAND.","LAL, B (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NOTTINGHAM BUSINESS SCH, NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND.","AKCA H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.04.012; ALI A, 2009; AVISON D, 2012, DOI 10.1057/jit.2012.6; BASKERVILLE R, 2012, DOI 10.1057/jit.2012.9; BROWN A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/02681101003687793; CARTER L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x; DWIVEDI Y, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.03.001; HEEKS R, 2008, DOI 10.1109/mc.2008.192; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; MADON S, 2009, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20108; MEIJER A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2015.01.001; QURESHI S, 2015; QURESHI S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2013.789151; RANA N P, 2015; RANA N, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.019; RANA N, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10796-015-9613-y; RANA N, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2015.02.002; ROSE-ACKERMAN S, 2016; SAHAY S, 2013; SAHAY S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2014.933522; SANDOVAL-ALMAZAN R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2011.09.004; SHAREEF M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10796-014-9533-2; SHAREEF M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.006; UNITED NATIONS P, 2016; VENKATESH V, 2014, DOI 10.1111/isj.12008; VERDEGEM P, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2009.03.005; WALSHAM G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2016.1246406; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2014.06.004",1,2018,COMPUTER SCIENCE; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000511427500048,ISI,NOTTINGHAM BUSINESS SCH;SCH MANAGEMENT,NOTTINGHAM BUSINESS SCH,NA,"LAL B, 2018, NA","LAL B, 2018, NA",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1145/3209281.3209369,978-1-4503-6526-0,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION",1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NA,WOS

HOW DO THESE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS AFFECT CONSUMER WELL-BEING OR LIFE SATISFACTION? WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT MOBILE- AS COMPARED TO REGULAR ONLY- INTERNET USE ENHANCES CONSUMERS' PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION, WHICH IN TURN, ENHANCES LIFE SATISFACTION. ETHNIC STATUS (MAJORITY VS. MINORITY) AND NATIONAL WEALTH (RICHER VS. POORER COUNTRIES) SET UP BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THESE EFFECTS. WE TEST OUR HYPOTHESES USING MULTI-LEVEL MODELING AND A LARGE SCALE MULTINATIONAL DATASET COVERING RESPONSES OF > 26,000 CONSUMERS FROM 21 COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PERCEIVED PERSONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TYPE OF INTERNET ACCESS (REGULAR VS. MOBILE) AND LIFE SATISFACTION; THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF MOBILE INTERNET USE IS WEAKER FOR ETHNIC MINORITY THAN FOR MAJORITY CONSUMERS AND STRONGER IN POORER THAN IN RICHER COUNTRIES. WE DISCUSS THE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MARKETING AND PUBLIC POLICY.","KEDGE BUSINESS SCH, BP 921, F-13288 MARSEILLE 9, FRANCE.;  CONCORDIA UNIV, JOHN MOLSON SCH BUSINESS, 1455 MAISONNEUVE WEST, MONTREAL, PQ H3G 1M8, CANADA.;  CARDIFF UNIV, CARDIFF BUSINESS SCH, ABERCONWAY BLDG,COLUMN DR, CARDIFF CF10 3EU, S GLAM, WALES.;  UNIV TEXAS ARLINGTON, 701 SOUTH NEDDERMAN DR, ARLINGTON, TX 76019 USA.","BARTIKOWSKI, B (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KEDGE BUSINESS SCH, BP 921, F-13288 MARSEILLE 9, FRANCE.","ALEGRE I, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.113; ARBORE A, 2014; BATRA R, 2000, DOI 10.1207/s15327663jcp0902_3; BERGKVIST L, 2007, DOI 10.1509/jmkr.44.2.175; BHARDWAJ V, 2011, DOI 10.1080/08961530.2011.543052; BROWN A, 2016; BURROUGHS J, 2002, DOI 10.1086/344429; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.027; DIAMANTOPOULOS A, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s11747-011-0300-3; DIENER E, 1995, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.68.4.653; DIENER E, 1994, DOI 10.1007/bf01207052; DONNER J, 2013; DROLET A, 2001, DOI 10.1177/109467050133001; DUNAWAY J, 2015; EL HEDHLI K, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.06.011; GAHRAN A, 2012; GAO T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.05.046; HOFFMAN D L, 2001; HORRIGAN J B, 2015; HUANG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1108/03090561011047463; JUDGE T, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.91.1.126; KIM Y, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.059; LA RUE F, 2011; LEVY S, 1959; LOPEZ M H, 2013; MARTIN K, 2012, DOI 10.1086/661528; METHA S, 2015; MISHRA A, 2014, DOI 10.1108/jpbm-12-2013-0459; MOSSBERGER K, 2012; MUTHEN L, 2007; NIELSEN, 2012; PENARD T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.08.004; QU H, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.07.010; ROSSITER J, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-8116(02)00097-6; RYAN R, 2000, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68; SHANKAR V, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.intmar.2009.02.002; SIRGY M J, 2001; SIRGY M J, 1995; SIRGY M, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s11205-009-9479-9; SIRGY M, 2008, DOI 10.1509/jppm.27.2.207; STUMP R, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0276146708325386; TAY L, 2011, DOI 10.1037/a0023779; TOSSELL C, 2015, DOI 10.1111/bjet.12176; VENKATESH V, 2000, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926; VERHALLEN T, 1994, DOI 10.1016/0167-4870(94)90007-8; WORLD B, 2016; WORTHAM J, 2009; ZICKUHR K, 2012; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",35,2018,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000414881400036,ISI,KEDGE BUSINESS SCH;CONCORDIA UNIV;CARDIFF UNIV;UNIV TEXAS ARLINGTON,KEDGE BUSINESS SCH,NA,"BARTIKOWSKI B, 2018, J BUS RES","BARTIKOWSKI B, 2018, J BUS RES",CANADA;FRANCE;USA;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.05.033,NA,BUSINESS,36,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NA,WOS

THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT AT ALTO ALMANZORA, A RURAL PUBLIC SCHOOL LOCATED IN ARMUNA DE ALMANZORA, A TOWN IN ALMERIA. THE METHODOLOGY USED WAS A QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND, ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS RESEARCH, IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPT FOR A CASE STUDY. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF A TOTAL OF 15 STUDENTS AND A TEACHER. FOR DATA COLLECTION, TWO SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE PLANNED, DIRECTED ON THE ONE HAND TO THE STUDENTS AND ON THE OTHER HAND TO THE TEACHER. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE STUDENTS DO NOT BENEFIT FROM SPECIFIC TRAINING PROPOSALS ON THE USE OF ICT, ONLY IN THE SUBJECTS OF DIGITAL CULTURE AND CITIZENSHIP. THE TEACHER HAS A LOW LEVEL OF DIGITAL TEACHING COMPETENCE AND DOES NOT RECEIVE SPECIFIC TRAINING ON THE USE OF ICT WITH STUDENTS. AND, FINALLY, THE TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AT THE SCHOOL CAN ONLY BE USED BY FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS, SO A LACK OF RESOURCES AND TRAINING IS EVIDENT IN MOST OF THE EDUCATIONAL LEVELS AT THE SCHOOL.","UNIV MURCIA, MURCIA, SPAIN.","REYES, JS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MURCIA, MURCIA, SPAIN.","ALONSO PEREZ M T, 2011; PEREZ M, 2014; JULIA IGUAL J, 2006; MACMILLAN J, 2007; MOYA LOPEZ M, 2013; ORTEGA I, 2009; RASO F, 2015; RASO F, 2015; REEVES T C, 2006",3,2019,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000516546700011,ISI,UNIV MURCIA,UNIV MURCIA,NA,"REYES JS, 2019, INNOEDUCA","REYES JS, 2019, INNOEDUCA",SPAIN,10.24310/innoeduca.2019.v5i2.4995,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,3,UNIV MALAGA,NA,WOS

THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ATTEMPTS TO ACHIEVE A KNOWLEDGEABLE OLDER ADULT POPULATION REGARDING INTERNET USE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE USERS' SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND AND AVAILABLE ACCESS POINTS.","UNIV ZURICH, ANDREASSTR 15, CH-8050 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;  NORTHWESTERN UNIV, EVANSTON, IL USA.;  MICROSOFT RES, REDMOND, WA USA.","HARGITTAI, E (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZURICH, ANDREASSTR 15, CH-8050 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.","ARNING K, 2008, DOI 10.1080/01449290802127153; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOOT W, 2015, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnt117; BRAJNIK G, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10209-011-0220-5; BREWER R, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2858036.2858379; BREWER R, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2858036.2858198; BREWER R, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2839303; BUCUR A, 1999, DOI 10.1089/cpb.1999.2.505; BUNDESAMT FR S, 2016; CARPENTER B, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2006.08.015; CAVENDER A, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10209-011-0219-y; CHOI N, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2645; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; COTTEN S, 2016; COTTEN S, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2306; COTTEN S, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.021; CRABB M, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2856046; CRESCI M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03601270903212476; CZAJA S, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.21.2.333; CZAJA S, 2012, DOI 10.1093/geront/gns004; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DE CHOUDHURY M, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2556288.2557214; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DOBRANSKY K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600751298; DOBRANSKY K, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2016.08.003; DUTTON W H, 2009; ERICKSON J, 2011, DOI 10.1017/s0714980811000109; FREESE J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.008; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GONCALVES V, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10209-015-0429-9; GUO P, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3025453.3025945; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HANSON V, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10209-011-0224-1; HARGITTAI E, 2008; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2017, DOI 10.22230/cjc2017v42n2a3176; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0002716215570866; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.957711; HARGITTAI E, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0894439310397146; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HEART T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.03.002; HENKE M, 1999, DOI 10.1089/cpb.1999.2.521; HILL R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.062; HOPE A, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2556288.2557133; LEE C, 2015, DOI 10.1111/jpim.12176; LEHTINEN V, 2009, DOI 10.14236/ewic/hci2009.6; LIVINGSTONE S, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342697; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; MANAFO E, 2012, DOI 10.1080/15398285.2012.701163; MARQUIE J, 2002, DOI 10.1080/0144929021000020998; MITZNER T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.020; OFFICE FOR NATIONAL S, 2016; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PARK C, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.044; PERRIN A, 2015; PIPER A, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10209-016-0500-1; PIPER A, 2016, DOI 10.4018/ijmhci.2016040105; ROGERS W, 1996, DOI 10.1518/001872096778940723; SAUNDERS E, 2004, DOI 10.1080/03601270490466967; SELWYN N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0267323105049631; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SENGPIEL M, 2015; SMITH A, 2014; SUM S, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0010; VAN BOEKEL LEONIEKE C, 2017, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6853; VAN DER GEEST T, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10209-013-0304-5; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.001; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VROMAN K, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.018; WASSERMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00301.x; WORLD HEALTH O, 2015; WORLD HEALTH O, 2015; ZICKUHR K, 2012; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x; ZYSKOWSKI K, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2675133.2675158",149,2019,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000493694200010,ISI,UNIV ZURICH;NORTHWESTERN UNIV;MICROSOFT RES,UNIV ZURICH,NA,"HARGITTAI E, 2019, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC","HARGITTAI E, 2019, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC",SWITZERLAND;USA;USA,10.1007/s10209-018-0617-5,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, CYBERNETICS; ERGONOMICS",150,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [IIS-1551574],WOS

THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF AID FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) (A COMPONENT OF AFT) ON THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE OF RECIPIENT COUNTRIES, MEASURED BY THE INTERNET PENETRATION RATE (I.E., THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS USING THE INTERNET IN A GIVEN COUNTRY) AND THE INTERNET PENETRATION DISTANCE (I.E., THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COUNTRY'S INTERNET PENETRATION RATE AND THE WORLD AVERAGE). THE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON A SAMPLE OF 119 COUNTRIES, SPANNING THE PERIOD 2004-2015. WE FIND EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE THAT HIGHER AFT INFLOWS FOR ICT ARE CONDUCIVE TO BOTH HIGHER INTERNET PENETRATION RATE AND HIGHER INTERNET PENETRATION DISTANCE FOR RECIPIENT COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, MORE ADVANCED AFT RECIPIENT-COUNTRIES EXPERIENCE A HIGHER POSITIVE EFFECT OF AFT FOR ICT THAN DO RELATIVELY LESS ADVANCED COUNTRIES. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SCALING UP OF AFT FOR ICT FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (BUT PARTICULARLY THE POOREST COUNTRIES) IS NECESSARY TO HELP THEM BUILD THE INTERNET-RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO BENEFIT FROM THE GROWING DIGITAL ECONOMY.","ORG MONDIALE COMMERCE DEV, RUE LAUSANNE 154, CH-1202 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.","GNANGNON, SK (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ORG MONDIALE COMMERCE DEV, RUE LAUSANNE 154, CH-1202 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.","ARTHUR W, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2006.11.005; BLUNDELL R, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0304-4076(98)00009-8; CALI M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.09.018; CHINN MENZIE D, 2004; CHOI C, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2010.08.005; CHOI C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2009.03.028; CLARKE G, 2006, DOI 10.1093/ei/cbj026; DASGUPTA S, 2001; FREUND C, 2002, DOI 10.1257/000282802320189320; FREUND C, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0022-1996(03)00059-x; GNANGNON S, 2017; KIIKI S, 2001; KIISKI S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3; LECHMAN E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.01.006; LIN F, 2015, DOI 10.1080/09638199.2014.881906; LIO M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.01.005; NICKELL S, 1981, DOI 10.2307/1911408; PAUNOV C, 2013; PAUNOV C, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.029; PHILLIPS P, 2009, DOI 10.1002/jae.1080; POHJOLA M, 1998; PRIMROSE J, 2003; QUIBRIA M, 2003; ROODMAN D, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00542.x; SAINTPAUL G, 1992, DOI 10.1016/0014-2921(92)90056-3; SINGH V, 2004; WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (, 2005; YARTEY C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.02.002; YI M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jpolmod.2005.06.008",8,2019,COMMUNICATION; GOVERNMENT & LAW,WOS:000482814100001,ISI,NA,SK (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"GNANGNON SK, 2019, POLICY INTERNET","GNANGNON SK, 2019, POLICY INTERNET",SWITZERLAND,10.1002/poi3.220,NA,COMMUNICATION; POLITICAL SCIENCE,8,WILEY,NA,WOS

DUE TO THE QUANTITATIVE NATURE OF MOST DIGITAL DIVIDE STUDIES, THOROUGH EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES EXIST ARE LACKING. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 48 DUTCH FAMILIES SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF EDUCATIONAL LEVEL (HIGH OR LOW) AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS (CHILDREN AND MARITAL STATUS).

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE CONFRONTATION WITH NEGATIVE OUTCOMES OF INTERNET USE IN ITSELF SEEMS SIMILAR FOR BOTH EDUCATIONAL GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE WAY INTERNET USERS COPE WITH NEGATIVE OUTCOMES DIFFERS BETWEEN THE TWO EDUCATIONAL GROUPS. MEMBERS OF HIGHLY EDUCATED GROUPS MOSTLY TRY TO TAKE CONTROL THEMSELVES WHEN FACED WITH A NEGATIVE OUTCOME, WHILE MEMBERS OF LESS EDUCATED GROUPS OFTEN JUST EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE OUTCOMES AND DO NOT REMEDIAL ACTIONS.","UNIV TWENTE, DEPT COMMUN SCI, NL-7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","SCHEERDER, AJ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TWENTE, DEPT COMMUN SCI, NL-7500 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","BARGH J, 2004, DOI 10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141922; BLANK G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BLANK G, 2015; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BOURDIEU P, 1984; CENTRALOF S, 2017; CHEN Y, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jsr.12388; COCKERHAM W, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6193-3_7; DEHUE F, 2012, DOI 10.1037/a0028969; HEIJSTRA T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2010.03.004; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; KATTARI S, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0898264315590228; KOWALSKI R, 2014, DOI 10.1037/a0035618; KUSS D, 2014, DOI 10.2174/13816128113199990617; KUSS D, 2013, DOI 10.2147/prbm.s39476; MACCOBY E, 2007; NIU H J, 2014; PARRIS L, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0044118x11398881; PORTES A, 1998, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.24.1.1; PRIVITERA C, 2009, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2009.0025; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROTH S, 1986, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.41.7.813; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SINGH K, 2016, DOI 10.5817/cp2016-2-4; SPADA M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.09.007; SURIS J, 2014, DOI 10.4414/smw.2014.14061; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817715282; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2019; VAN EIJCK K, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2004.09.001; VRIENS E, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817724169; WALL D, 2005; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",16,2019,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000480896500001,ISI,UNIV TWENTE,UNIV TWENTE,NA,"SCHEERDER AJ, 2019, INF SOC","SCHEERDER AJ, 2019, INF SOC",NETHERLANDS,10.1080/01972243.2019.1649774,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,WOS

SINCE 2012, MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION HAS SHOWN NEARLY LINEAR GROWTH, REACHING 83% IN 2016. HOWEVER, THIS STATISTIC FALLS TO ONLY 46% AFTER CORRECTING FOR OWNERSHIP OF MULTIPLE SIM CARDS AND SHARING OF MOBILE PHONES AMONG MULTIPLE USERS. THE DETERMINANTS OF MOBILE PHONE OWNERSHIP IN NIGERIA ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, WHICH HINDERS RESEARCH THAT COULD INFORM POLICIES CAPABLE OF INCREASING MOBILE PHONE PENETRATION AND ELIMINATING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. TO BEGIN TO FILL THIS RESEARCH GAP, WE HAVE ANALYZED SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS RELATED TO MOBILE PHONE OWNERSHIP IN THE COUNTRY. WE USED A LOGIT MODEL AND THE LATEST NATIONAL-LEVEL DATAFIRST ICT DATASET (2012) ABOUT MOBILE PHONE ADOPTION FROM 1552 INDIVIDUALS. THE SAMPLE WAS STRATIFIED, CLUSTERED, AND PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED TO MAKE IT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SITUATION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FACTORS SUCH AS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND INCOME MAY NOT STRONGLY INFLUENCE MOBILE PHONE OWNERSHIP, IN CONTRAST TO WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. INSTEAD, THE STRONGEST FACTORS APPEARED TO BE EDUCATION LEVEL, INFORMAL WORK, SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT, TYPE OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT TO INCREASE MOBILE PHONE OWNERSHIP AND CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, POLICY MAKERS SHOULD TARGET YOUNGER ADULTS, PROVIDE TRAINING IN DIGITAL LITERACY SPECIFICALLY FOR MOBILE PHONE USE, INVEST IN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DEVELOP CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS IN NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGES. THESE FINDINGS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING MOBILE PHONE DISTRIBUTION IN NIGERIA AS WELL AS INFORM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COUNTRY'S ICT ROADMAP 2017-2020 AND VISION 2020.","UNIV ZAGREB, FAC TRANSPORT & TRAFF SCI, DEPT INFORMAT & COMMUN TRAFF, VUKELICEVA 4, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","FORENBACHER, I (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZAGREB, FAC TRANSPORT & TRAFF SCI, DEPT INFORMAT & COMMUN TRAFF, VUKELICEVA 4, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","ABBEY R, 2009, DOI 10.1108/14779960911004480; ADEGBIJA M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.01.482; AKER J, 2010; AKHTER S, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0167-4870(02)00171-x; AL-JAGHOUB S, 2009, DOI 10.1108/14779960910955864; ARIKPO I, 2009; ARMEY L, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.005; BAGCHI K, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2005.10856402; BENJAMIN N, 2012, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-9537-0; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.006; BIMBER B, 2000; BRANNSTROM I, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2011.03.004; CHABOSSOU A, 2009, DOI 10.1109/ictd.2009.5426688; CHAIR C, 2018; CHAMBERS R, 2003; CHEN D, 2010, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2010.10856513; CHIEMEKE S C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/b978-008045312-5/50058-3; CHOUDRIE J, 2005, DOI 10.1108/17410390510624016; CULLEN R, 2003, DOI 10.1108/02640470310480506; DUDEK H, 2007; FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF N, 2017; FIFE E, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.05.004; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; GILLWALD A, 2018; GILLWALD A, 2010; GONCALVES G, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.039; GRZYBOWSKI L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.010; GSM ASSOCIATION (, 2015; GSM ASSOCIATION (, 2016; GSM ASSOCIATION (, 2018; GSMA, 2017; GUPTA R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.01.001; HAUGHTON J, 2009; HEERINGA S, 2017, DOI 10.1201/9781315153278; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; HINES ALICIA H, 2001; HONORE B, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.08.002; HOSMER D J, 2013, DOI 10.1002/9781118548387; JENNINGS L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.01.016; KENDE M, 2016; KILENTHONG W, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.005; KNOCHE H, 2012; KPODAR K R, 2011; LEE S, 2012, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2010.508730; LINDELL I, 2013; AVILES J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.11.001; MIDDLETON K, 2010, DOI 10.1108/09593841011022528; MOON J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2010.04.018; MUMPOREZE N, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.05.014; MUSCHERT G W, 2015; MWIN E, 2016; NISHIJIMA M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.10.004; OECD, 2018; OJAMERUAYE E, 2013; OKUNOLA O, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.02.002; ONYEAJUWA M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.05.004; ORVISKA M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2009.06.002; PATTERSON J, 2016; PENARD T, 2012; RESEARCH ICT A, 2012; RIGGINS F, 2005; ROOKSBY E, 2002, DOI 10.5172/rsj.12.3.197; SALAJAN F, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.06.017; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SCHLEIFE K, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003; SCHOENTGEN A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.05.011; SCHUMACHER P, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(00)00032-7; SEKABIRA H, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.10.004; SRINUAN C, 2011; SZELES M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.007; THOMPSON H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.03.002; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2018.06.001; TRAN M, 2015, DOI 10.2196/mhealth.3663; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2009.06.005; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VIE S, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compcom.2007.09.004; WAMUYU P, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.08.004; WAVERMAN L, 2005; WAYCOTT J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2009.11.006; WEI K, 2010; WETZL A, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compcom.2010.03.006; YEBOAH-BOATENG E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.07.008; ZHANG X, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2016.06.010; ZHAO H, 2007, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2007040102",26,2019,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000480512100002,ISI,UNIV ZAGREB,UNIV ZAGREB,NA,"FORENBACHER I, 2019, TELECOMMUN POLICY","FORENBACHER I, 2019, TELECOMMUN POLICY",CROATIA,10.1016/j.telpol.2019.03.001,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,27,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,NA,WOS

DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO AND USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) IN HOUSEHOLDS AND BY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN USING THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGY: 1) FACTOR ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY VARIABLES OF USE OF AND ACCESS TO ICTS IN HOUSEHOLDS AND BY INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPEAN REGIONS ON THE BASIS OF DATA PROVIDED BY EUROSTAT; 2) CONSTRUCTION OF A SYNTHETIC INDEX, THE HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUAL DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX (HIDDI) ON THE BASIS OF IDENTIFIED FACTORS; 3) ANALYSIS OF THE SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT TO IDENTIFY, DELIMIT AND QUANTIFY SPATIAL PATTERNS AND CLUSTERS IN EUROPEAN REGIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPEAN REGIONS IS FOUNDED ON BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE DD OF EUROPEAN REGIONS IS BASED ON HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS' DAILY USE OF E-COMMERCE, E-BANKING AND E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE USE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH BROADBAND SHOWS LESS DD IN EUROPE. THE VALUES OBTAINED BY USING THE HIDDI FOR EACH EUROPEAN REGION REVEAL THAT THE MAXIMUM DD BETWEEN THESE IS 37%, WITH THE SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS IDENTIFYING A NW-SE PATTERN IN EUROPE. THUS, A REGION'S LEVEL OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT OF ITS NEIGHBOURS; AND GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY/VICINITY IS AN ELEMENT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN ANALYSING THE DISPARITIES OF THE DD.","UNIV SEVILLE, C MARIA DE PADILLA S-N, SEVILLE 41004, SPAIN.","LUCENDO-MONEDERO, AL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SEVILLE, C MARIA DE PADILLA S-N, SEVILLE 41004, SPAIN.","ALIZADEH T, 2017, DOI 10.1080/02513625.2017.1380411; ALIZADEH T, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.02.002; AMICHAI-HAMBURGER Y, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00014-6; AMIN A, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.0435-3684.2004.00152.x; ASHEIM B, 2019, DOI 10.1080/13511610.2018.1491001; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BEUGELSDIJK S, 2019, DOI 10.1111/sjoe.12253; BEUGELSDIJK S, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00343404.2017.1334118; BILLON M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10290-016-0259-8; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00461.x; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BRUNO G, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2010.534364; CHARRON N, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11205-014-0702-y; CORROCHER N, 2002, DOI 10.1080/02683960210132061; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.027; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; EASTIN M, 2015, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2015.1054994; EUROPEAN C, 2010; FALCH M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.004; FEIJOO C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.001; FREEMAN J, 2016; FRÍAS- NAVARRO D, 2012; FUCHS C, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; GETIS A, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x; GIJON C, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2015.11.003; GRUBESIC T, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2004.08.001; GRUBESIC T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.11.017; HAIR J, 2004; HALE T, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0002764210361685; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HOWARD P, 2010; IAMMARINO S, 2019, DOI 10.1093/jeg/lby021; JANKOWSKI P, 1995, DOI 10.1080/02693799508902036; KALMUS V, 2011, DOI 10.3176/tr.2011.4.04; KRAEMAR K, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00071; KYRIAKIDOU V, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2011.09.001; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MORAN P, 1948; MOROZ M, 2017, DOI 10.1515/fman-2017-0014; NISHIDA T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.05.004; NOVO-CORTI I, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.12.040; OECD, 2008; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.seps.2014.09.001; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; RIGGINS, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00074; RUIZ-RODRIGUEZ F, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.007; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHLICHTER B, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.09.003; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SHELTON T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.02.020; STAPLETON J, 1997; STOCKER V, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.06.001; SUJARWOTO S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.008; TOBLER W, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.09402009.x; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; VU K, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.02.008; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WITTE J, 2010; YU L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0961000606070600; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x; ZOROJA J, 2011",36,2019,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000474681900015,ISI,UNIV SEVILLE,UNIV SEVILLE,NA,"LUCENDO-MONEDERO AL, 2019, TELEMAT INFORM","LUCENDO-MONEDERO AL, 2019, TELEMAT INFORM",SPAIN,10.1016/j.tele.2019.05.002,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,37,ELSEVIER,"PLAN ESTATAL 2013-2016 EXCELENCIA-PROYECTOS I + D OF THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS (SPAIN) [CSO2015-67662]",WOS

ANOTHER EMPIRICAL FINDING OF OUR RESEARCH IS THAT THE DEGREE OF EDUCATIONAL HOMOGAMY IN THE COUPLE EXERTS AN ADDITIONAL EFFECT ON THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIOL APLICADA, MADRID, SPAIN.","MANZANO, D (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIOL APLICADA, MADRID, SPAIN.","BAIZAN P, 2014, DOI 10.1080/14616696.2013.859717; BREEN R, 1997, DOI 10.1177/104346397009003002; CASTANO C, 2008; CEBOLLA H, 2013; CHALASANI S, 2007, DOI 10.13085/eijtur.4.1.93-117; FERNANDEZ-MELLIZO M, 2018, DOI 10.5565/rev/papers.2369; FUCHS T, 2004; GIL-GARCIA J, 2006; HARGITTAI E, 2013; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HOWARD P, 2001; KUHLEMEIER H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2005.10.004; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MALAMUD O, 2010; MONNA B, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10834-008-9121-z; OECD, 2017; OECD, 2015; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SIANOU-KYRGIOU E, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-1083-6_5; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2018.06.001; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.012; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1111401; ALBERO C, 2017, DOI 10.5565/rev/papers.2233; ALBERO C, 2011, DOI 10.3989/ris.2010.01.15; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; ZHONG Z, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.016",5,2019,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000487825600006,ISI,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,NA,"MANZANO D, 2019, REV INT SOCIOL","MANZANO D, 2019, REV INT SOCIOL",SPAIN,10.3989/ris.2019.77.3.17.165,NA,SOCIOLOGY,5,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC,NA,WOS

OPT. COMMUN. NETW.,ARTICLE,DATA CENTER; DEVELOPING WORLD; FIBER ACCESS; NETWORK ARCHITECTURE; NREN; OFCITY; RURAL BROADBAND,NA,"OVER THE PAST 50 YEARS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY HAS PROVIDED UNPRECEDENTED SUPPORT TO THE STEADY ECONOMIC GROWTH OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IN RECENT YEARS, SOME OF THE LARGEST GROWTH HAS BEEN REPORTED IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, WHICH, HOWEVER, OFTEN LACK ADEQUATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE TO FURTHER SUSTAIN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH A NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SYSTEM VENDORS HAVE STARTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, THE CHALLENGES THEY ENCOUNTER ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD, INCLUDING AN UNRELIABLE ELECTRICITY GRID, POOR FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE, LOW REVENUE EXPECTATIONS, AND OFTEN A HARSH CLIMATE ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER REPORTS USE CASES AND SOLUTIONS PERTINENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORKING INFRASTRUCTURE IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, PROVIDED BY ORGANIZATIONS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN SUCH ACTIVITIES. AFTER PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT STATE OF NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE MAIN CHALLENGES FOR AFRICA AND RURAL CHINA, THE PAPER PROVIDES DETAILS ON TWO PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. THE FIRST FOCUSES ON THE PROVISIONING OF SERVICES AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-COST DATA CENTERS, WHEREAS THE SECOND PROPOSES COST-EFFECTIVE ADAPTATION OF BOTH FIBER AND HYBRID COPPER FIBER TECHNOLOGY TO RURAL AREAS. THE ARTICLE IS CONCLUDED WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON THE COMPLEMENTARITY OF THE TWO APPROACHES.","UNIV DUBLIN, TRINITY COLL, CONNECT TELECOMMUN RES CTR, DUBLIN, IRELAND.;  CSIR, SOUTH AFRICAN NATL RES NETWORK SANREN, PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.;  ALIBABA GRP, ALIBABA INFRASTRUCT SERV, SUNNYVALE, CA 94085 USA.;  ALIBABA GRP, ALIBABA INFRASTRUCT SERV, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.;  UNIV OREGON, NETWORK STARTUP RESOURCE CTR, EUGENE, OR 97403 USA.;  ESNET, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.;  ZTE CORP, SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;  ZTE TX INC, AUSTIN, TX 78730 USA.","RUFFINI, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV DUBLIN, TRINITY COLL, CONNECT TELECOMMUN RES CTR, DUBLIN, IRELAND.","AHMED I, 2018, DOI 10.1109/comst.2018.2843719; BISSESSUR H, 2014; DOBBS R, 2012; FOLEY M, 2016; KAZEEM Y, 2017; LAVERY D, 2018, DOI 10.1109/mcom.2018.1701084; LUO L, 2015; MAGNE F, 2018; RULLINI M, 2019, DOI 10.1109/jlt.2019.2891990; TECHECONOMY, 2018; THE STATE C, 2013; TUCKER R, 2017, DOI 10.1364/jocn.9.00a245; ZHU B, 2016, DOI 10.1364/oe.24.025291",2,2019,COMPUTER SCIENCE; OPTICS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000475503200003,ISI,UNIV DUBLIN;SOUTH AFRICAN NATL RES NETWORK SANREN;UNIV OREGON,UNIV DUBLIN,NA,"RUFFINI M, 2019, J OPT COMMUN NETW","RUFFINI M, 2019, J OPT COMMUN NETW",CHINA;CHINA;IRELAND;SOUTH AFRICA;USA;USA;USA;USA,10.1364/jocn.11.000354,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, HARDWARE & ARCHITECTURE; COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; OPTICS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS",2,OPTICAL SOC AMER,"SCIENCE FOUNDATION IRELAND (SFI) [14/IA/2527, 13/RC/2077]",WOS

THIS DISCUSSION IS FUELLED, IN PARTICULAR, BY THE EMERGENCE OF SMART MOBILITY, IN WHICH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) - E.G., THE SMARTPHONE - ARE USED TO SWITCH FLEXIBLY BETWEEN NEW INTERCONNECTED MOBILITY SERVICES (SUCH AS CARSHARING, RIDESHARING, BIKESHARING, BUS OR TRAIN). THE STARTING POINT FOR THE SCEPTICISM TOWARDS THIS TRANSITION IS THE RESEARCH ON TRANSPORT POVERTY, WHICH PROBLEMATIZES SOCIAL EXCLUSIONS FROM PARTICIPATION IN MOBILITY DUE TO THE UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF MODE OPTIONS. THIS PAPER SUGGESTS A CHANGE OF PERSPECTIVE FROM THE REAL MODE CHOICE TO POTENTIAL/OPTIONAL MODE CHOICE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SCEPTICISM IN THE RESEARCH ON MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOURS. MULTIOPTIONALITY IS CONCEPTUALISED AS A NECESSARY PRECONDITION FOR MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOURS TO ACHIEVE THIS CHANGE OF PERSPECTIVE. BASED ON THIS CONCEPTUALISATION, THREE THESES RESULT FROM A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF A DATA SET FROM AN AREA IN THE RHINE-MAIN REGION IN GERMANY. THE THESES CHALLENGE THE OFTEN-POSTULATED POTENTIAL UBIQUITY OF MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOURS: (I) TRANSPORT POVERTY - REPRESENTED BY A LACK OF MODE OPTIONS - INHIBITS THE POTENTIAL PRODUCTION OF MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOURS, PARTICULARLY BY SOCIALLY MARGINALISED PEOPLE (LOW INCOME, LOW EDUCATION, PRECARIOUS JOB SITUATION, ETC.). (II) A MULTIMODAL DIVIDE DESCRIBES THE REPRODUCTION OF TRANSPORT POVERTY IN THE GUISE OF MODERNISATION, AS THE TRANSPORT POOR - WITH FEW MODE OPTIONS- ALSO LACK CERTAIN ICTS THAT PROVIDE CENTRAL ACCESS MEDIA TO SMART MOBILITY. (III) ANOTHER (PERFIDIOUS) FORM OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION FROM PARTICIPATION IN SMART MOBILITY CONCERNS CRITICAL THINKERS WHO AVOID INSTALLING MOBILITY APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY. THIS EXCLUSION OCCURS BECAUSE THESE APPS DO NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE AS ACCESS SOFTWARE TO SMART MOBILITY.","ILS RES INST REG & URBAN DEV GGMBH, BRUDERWEG 22-24, D-44135 DORTMUND, GERMANY.","GROTH, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ILS RES INST REG & URBAN DEV GGMBH, BRUDERWEG 22-24, D-44135 DORTMUND, GERMANY.","ALTMAN J, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1359183507078122; ANABLE J, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2004.09.008; ATZORI L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.010; BACKHAUS K, 2011; BANISTER D, 1994; BANISTER D, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2007.10.005; BAUMAN Z, 2013; BECK U, 1992; BELK R, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.10.001; BELK R, 1988, DOI 10.1086/209154; BLUMENBERG E, 2014, DOI 10.1179/1942787513y.0000000009; BOHLER S, 2010; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BRECKNER I, 2013; BREITINGER M, 2016; BUEHLER R, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11116-014-9556-z; BUNDESREGIERUNG, 2009; CANZLER W, 2016, DOI 10.1080/23800127.2016.1147781; CANZLER W, 1998; CASS N, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-954x.2005.00565.x; CHAN N, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2011.621557; CHATTERJEE K, 2013, DOI 10.3141/2359-10; CHLOND B, 2011; CLARK J, 2016, DOI 10.17645/si.v4i3.510; CLIFTON K, 2004; COHEN-BLANKSHTAIN G, 2013; COSTAIN C, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2011.11.005; CURL A, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.01.002; CURRIE G, 2010; CURRIE G, 2011; DAHRENDORF R, 1979; DAUBITZ S, 2014; DELBOSC A, 2013, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2013.801929; DELBOSC A, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.06.006; DELBOSC A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.04.005; DELBOSC A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2010.01.003; DIANA M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2011.09.018; DIANA M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.trf.2008.09.001; DIEKMANN A, 2010; DOCHERTY I, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2017.09.012; ERIBON D, 2013; FIRNKORN J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.envsci.2014.09.005; FIRNKORN J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2012.08.003; FISHMAN E, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.trd.2014.05.013; FUCHS C, 2011; FUKUYAMA F, 1992; FURUHATA M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.trb.2013.08.012; GEELS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2012.01.021; GIDDENS A, 1986; GOODMAN A, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.04.004; GREINER H, 2012; GROSS P, 1994; GROTH S, 2019, DOI 10.2478/rara-2019-0003; GUBBI J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2013.01.010; HAMPSHIRE R, 2011, DOI 10.3141/2217-15; HEINEN E, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s11116-017-9810-2; HEINEN E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2015.05.015; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; HENSHER D, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2017.02.006; HESSISCHES STATISTISCHES L, 2014; HUNECKE M, 2000; KAUFMANN V, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.0309-1317.2004.00549.x; KENYON S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0966-6923(02)00012-1; KLINGER T, 2016; KLINGER T, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2017.01.008; KONRAD K, 2017; KOPP J, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11116-015-9606-1; KOSCHINSKY J, 2015; KRECKEL R, 2004; KRYGSMAN S, 2001; KUHNIMHOF T, 2006, DOI 10.3141/1985-05; KUHNIMHOF T, 2012, DOI 10.3141/2320-08; KUHNIMHOF T, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2012.736426; KUHNIMHOF T, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2012.04.018; KUHNIMHOF T, 2011, DOI 10.3141/2230-07; KUHNIMHOF T, 2010, DOI 10.3141/2190-03; LANZENDORF M, 2013; LEVINSON DAVID M, 2017; LITMAN T, 2017; LUCAS K, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.01.013; MARTIN E, 2010, DOI 10.3141/2143-19; MARTIN E, 2011, DOI 10.1109/tits.2011.2158539; MATTIOLI G, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.07.007; MCLAREN A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.01.006; MILLER H, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.07.005; MOLIN E, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2015.11.001; MURRAY A, 2001, DOI 10.1111/0022-4146.00233; NACHTWEY O, 2018; NOBIS C, 2007, DOI 10.3141/2010-05; OLAFSSON A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2016.03.010; OOSTENDORP R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2018.07.006; ORWELL G, 2004; PARKES S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.06.003; RAYLE L, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2015.10.004; RIFKIN J, 2000; SCHAFER P, 2016; SCHEINER J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2016.06.028; SCHWERDTFEGER S, 2018; SCOTT D, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s11116-005-0328-7; SHAHEEN S, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11116-015-9607-0; SHAHEEN S, 2013, DOI 10.3141/2387-10; SIMMA A, 2003; SMITH N, 2010; SPICKERMANN A, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.08.036; STATISTA G, 2019; STATISTISCHES B, 2014; TULLY C, 2017, DOI 10.1080/23800127.2017.1322778; TYNDALL J, 2017, DOI 10.1080/15568318.2016.1266425; VELAGA N, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.12.005; VIJ A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2013.07.008; VOGEL M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2014.07.005; WATKINS K, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2011.06.010",35,2019,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS; TRANSPORTATION,WOS:000474333300005,ISI,ILS RES INST REG AND URBAN DEV GGMBH,ILS RES INST REG AND URBAN DEV GGMBH,NA,"GROTH S, 2019, TRANSP RES PT A-POLICY PRACT","GROTH S, 2019, TRANSP RES PT A-POLICY PRACT",GERMANY,10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.018,NA,ECONOMICS; TRANSPORTATION; TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,36,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,"FEDERAL MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT, BUILDING AND URBAN AFFAIRS GERMAN; BMVBS",WOS

IN A CASE STUDY OF THE REPUBLIC OF TATARSTAN, THE AUTHORS USE THE THREE-LEVEL APPROACH TO EXPLORE INEQUALITIES IN ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND ICTS (THE FIRST LEVEL OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE), DIGITAL SKILLS AND DIGITAL LITERACY OF USERS (THE SECOND LEVEL), AND THE SOCIAL BENEFITS USERS CAN GET BY COMPETENTLY USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL AND PRIVATE LIFE (THE THIRD LEVEL). THE RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THE OPEN ACCESS DATA THE AUTHORS EXAMINED ARE NOT ENOUGH FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE THREE-LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE REPUBLIC, WHICH IN ITS TURN EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR AN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH BASED ON INTERPRETING THE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED IN THE REGION.","LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM, CHAIR MEDIA THEORY & ECON, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;  KAZAN VOLGA FED UNIV, HIGHER SCH JOURNALISM & MEDIA COMMUN, CHAIR NATL & GLOBAL MEDIA, KAZAN, RUSSIA.;  NORTHUMBRIA UNIV, DEPT SOCIAL SCI, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.","GLADKOVA, AA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM, CHAIR MEDIA THEORY & ECON, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","ACHARYA B, 2017; ALAMPALLI S, 2009, DOI 10.1061/(asce)1084-0702(2009)14:1(1); ASOCHAKOV YU V, 2015; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; AVILA A, 2009; BRAGINA E M, 2017; BRODOVSKAYA E, 2013; BUCHI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604154; BYKOV I, 2011; CASTELLS M, 2001; CASTELLS M, 2013; COLOMBO F, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-05; COMPAINE B, 2001; DAHLBERG L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10714421.2015.1085777; DAVAKI, 2018; DELICYN L L, 2006; DEVIATKO I, 2013; DIMAGGIO P, 2001; DRONOV V N, 2015; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; GALIMOVA R R, 2015; GARIFULLIN V Z, 2018; GARIFULLIN V Z, 2013; GILMANOVA A N, 2012; GLADKOVA A, 2013; GLADKOVA A, 2019; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; ISRAELASHVILI M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.07.015; KUZNECZOV Y, 2014; MUKHAMETZYANOVA R, 2015; NIEMINEN H, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0267323115614198; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; PARK S, 2017, DOI 10.1057/978-1-137-59332-0; POUSHTER J, 2016; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.30547/worldofmedia.4.2018.1; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; RAGNEDDA M, 2013; RAINIE L, 2016; RYKOV Y, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-69784-0_6; SERVAES J, 2006; SMIRNOVA O, 2009; SMIRNOVA O V, 2017; SMIRNOVA O V, 2017; SPARKS C, 2013, DOI 10.1080/13183222.2013.11009113; SYCHENKOVA A V, 2016; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN DIJK J, 2013; VARTANOVA E, 2013; VARTANOVA E, 2002, DOI 10.1177/17480485020640050501; VARTANOVA E, 2019; VARTANOVA E, 2018, DOI 10.30547/mediaalmanah.5.2018.812; VOLCHENKO O, 2016, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2016.5.10; WARSCHAUER M, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i7.967; WARSHAUER M, 2004; WESSELS B, 2013; ZHEREBIN V, 2015",5,2019,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000548298700003,ISI,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV;KAZAN VOLGA FED UNIV;NORTHUMBRIA UNIV,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,NA,"GLADKOVA AA, 2019, VESTN MOSK UNIV SER 10 ZHURNAL","GLADKOVA AA, 2019, VESTN MOSK UNIV SER 10 ZHURNAL",UNITED KINGDOM;RUSSIA;RUSSIA,10.30547/vestnik.journ.4.2019.4172,NA,COMMUNICATION,5,"M V LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, DEPT JOURNALISM",NA,WOS

THE FREQUENCIES OF INTERNET AND E-COMMERCE USE ARE CONSIDERED, ALONG WITH A BROAD RANGE OF INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL SINGLE MARKET STRATEGY. THIS PAPER AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE UNDERLYING THESE AGGREGATE OUTCOME INDICATORS. AN EXPLORATORY SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED IN A SAMPLE OF 209 REGIONS USING EUROSTAT DATA. STRONG EVIDENCE FOR BOTH GLOBAL AND LOCAL SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION IS FOUND FOR THE YEARS 2011-2016. CONSISTENTLY, A NORTH-SOUTH POLARIZATION SCHEME IS IDENTIFIED WITH LITTLE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE CENTRE OF EUROPE. THIS CONTRASTS WITH THE HIGH INCOME CLUSTER FOUND IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WHILE LOW VALUES FOR DIGITAL INDICES AND INCOME ARE CO-LOCATED MORE CONSISTENTLY IN THE SOUTH, BUT ALSO IN THE NORTH-EAST.

THIS LATTER ISSUE HAS NOT YET RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION BY SCHOLARS DESPITE ITS POTENTIALLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE EXTERNAL VALIDITY OF ONLINE SURVEY DATA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EXPLORE THE EXTENT TO WHICH A PERSON'S DIGITAL AFFINITY CONTRIBUTES TO NONRESPONSE BIAS IN THE GERMAN INTERNET PANEL, A PROBABILITY-BASED ONLINE PANEL OF THE GENERAL POPULATION. WITH A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DIGITAL AFFINITY, WE PREDICT RESPONSE TO THE FIRST ONLINE PANEL WAVE AND PARTICIPATION ACROSS PANEL WAVES. WE FIND THAT PERSONS WHO BELONG TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF DIGITAL AFFINITY HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY DIFFERENT SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND SHOW DIFFERENT VOTING BEHAVIOR. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT INITIAL RESPONSE PROPENSITIES VARY BY CLASSES OF DIGITAL AFFINITY, AS DO ATTRITION PATTERNS OVER TIME.

THE STUDY EXPLORES DIGITAL DIVIDE GAPS AND THE IMPACTS OF ONLINE COMMUNICATION ON THE OVERALL COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON ONLINE HEALTH CARE IN DENMARK. THE AUTHORS RELY ON POPULATION DATA FROM 3,500 E-VISITS (E-MAIL CONSULTATIONS) BETWEEN PATIENTS AND GENERAL PRACTITIONERS (GPS) FROM 2009 TO 2015. ADDITIONALLY, THEY INCLUDE SURVEY DATA ON THE USE OF THE INTERNET TO SEARCH FOR HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION. FINDINGS THE ANALYSIS OF THE DANISH DATA REVEALS A RAPID UPTAKE IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET TO SEARCH FOR HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION AND A THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN E-VISITS FROM 2009 TO 2015. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE GAPS EXIST ALSO IN THE ONLINE HEALTH-CARE COMMUNICATION. FURTHER, THE STUDY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ENFORCED SUPPLY OF ONLINE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN GPS AND PATIENTS DOES NOT ALLEVIATE THE COSTS. RATHER, THE NUMBER OF VISITS TO GPS HAS NOT BEEN DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND HEALTH-CARE COSTS SHOWING A MARGINAL INCREASE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS - FURTHER DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED TO EXPLORE THE IMPACTS OF OTHER INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS AND POPULATION COHORT ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND HEALTHCARE COSTS. ALSO, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE WHETHER THE INCREASED USE OF ONLINE HEALTH CARE IN THE LONG RUN LEAD TO LOWERING OVERALL HEALTH-CARE COSTS. WHILE THE INTERNAL VALIDITY OF THE STUDY IS HIGH DUE TO THE USE OF POPULATION DATA, THE EXTERNAL VALIDITY IS LOWER AS THE STUDY RESULTS ARE BASED ON THE DATA COLLECTED IN DENMARK ONLY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS - THE STUDY OFFERS IMPORTANT INPUT FOR PRACTICE. FIRST, LEADERS IN GOVERNMENT MIGHT RECONSIDER HOW THEY CAN CONTROL THE HEALTH-CARE COSTS WHEN OPENING ONLINE CHANNELS FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PATIENTS AND DOCTORS. SECOND, CONCERNS ABOUT DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES REMAINS, BUT THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE UPTAKE OF E-VISITS DOES NOT WIDEN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC, GENDER OR AGE GAPS. FOR HEALTH POLICY CONCERN, THIS IS ENCOURAGING NEWS TO LEAD TO AN INCREASING PUSH OF ONLINE COMMUNICATION. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THE DYNAMICS OF ONLINE HEALTH-CARE COMMUNICATION MAY LEAD TO MIXED RESULTS AND UNEXPECTED IMPACTS ON OVERALL HEALTH-CARE COSTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER OFFERS NEW INSIGHTS IN THE IMPACTS OF MANDATORY SUPPLY OF DIGITAL SERVICES. THE DANISH PUSH-STRATEGY HAS LED TO AN ENFORCED SUPPLY OF E-VISITS AND A RAPID GROWING USE OF THE ONLINE HEALTH CARE WITHOUT WIDENING DIGITAL DIVIDE BUT AT THE RISK OF POTENTIAL INCREASING THE OVERALL COSTS.","COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCH, DEPT DIGITALIZAT, FREDERIKSBERG, DENMARK.;  AALBORG UNIV, DEPT POLIT SCI, AALBORG, DENMARK.;  KDI SCH PUBL POLICY & MANAGEMENT, SEJONG, SOUTH KOREA.","ANDERSEN, KN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCH, DEPT DIGITALIZAT, FREDERIKSBERG, DENMARK.","AGARWAL R, 2010, DOI 10.1287/isre.1100.0327; ALKAYID K, 2009, DOI 10.1108/17506160910979360; ANCKER J, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11606-011-1749-y; ANDREASSEN H, 2007, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-7-53; BAKER L, 2003, DOI 10.1001/jama.289.18.2400; BANKS J, 2018; BLACK A, 2011, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000387; BOWKER J, 2000; BRYNJOLFSSON E, 1993, DOI 10.1145/163298.163309; BUNTIN M, 2011, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0178; BYGSTAD B, 2017, DOI 10.1108/tg-09-2016-0057; DUPLAGA M, 2012, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2358; EDWARDS J, 2006; EUROSTAT, 2013; EUROSTAT D, 2022; FARR M, 2018, DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019966; FONKYCH K, 2005; GITTEL, 2009; GOEL M, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11606-011-1728-3; GOLDZWEIG C, 2009, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.28.2.w282; HILLESTAD R, 2005, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.24.5.1103; HIMMELSTEIN D, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.09.004; JACKLIN P, 2003, DOI 10.1136/bmj.327.7406.84; JONES C, 2012, DOI 10.1108/17506161211267400; KANTHAWALA S, 2016, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5369; KATEHAKIS D, 2016, DOI 10.1108/tg-07-2015-0032; KJAER NIELS K, 2005; KOTENKO J, 2013; LIDDY C, 2016; MEHROTRA A, 2013, DOI 10.1089/tmj.2012.0221; NAKAYAMA I, 2012, DOI 10.1186/1746-1596-7-177; OECD, 2012; OECD, 2013; PEDERSEN K, 2012, DOI 10.3122/jabfm.2012.02.110216; POLLITT C, 2012; PORS A, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jhom-10-2016-0193; QUINN S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.032; RICO A, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1467-9515.00360; SANDERS B, 2015; SANTANA S, 2011, DOI 10.1186/1471-2296-12-20; SCHMEIDA M, 2007, DOI 10.1353/hpu.2007.0068; SEYBERT H, 2011; SHEKELLE P, 2006; SHEKELLE P, 2006; SILVESTRE A, 2009, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.28.2.334; SMITH G, 2018; STATISTICS D, 2013; STRANDBERG-LARSEN M, 2007; TOPOL E, 2015; VAN DER VAART R, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2428; WACHTER R, 2015; WHITTEN P, 2007, DOI 10.2165/00115677-200715040-00002",11,2019,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000484192600004,ISI,COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCH;AALBORG UNIV;KDI SCH PUBL POLICY AND MANAGEMENT,COPENHAGEN BUSINESS SCH,NA,"ANDERSEN KN, 2019, TRANSFORM GOV-PEOPLE PROCESS POLICY","ANDERSEN KN, 2019, TRANSFORM GOV-PEOPLE PROCESS POLICY",DENMARK;DENMARK;KOREA,10.1108/tg-06-2018-0041,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,11,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,NA,WOS

NONETHELESS, THE EXISTENCE OF THIS WEALTH OF ONLINE HEALTH INFORMATION GENERATES CHALLENGES RELATED TO ACCESS AND USER SKILLS. WHEREAS PREVIOUS STUDIES SURVEYED A CROSS-SECTION OF USERS, OUR AIM IS TO COMPLEMENT THEM WITH A POPULATION-LEVEL STUDY. WE USE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA COLLECTED BY STATISTICS FINLAND BETWEEN 2006 AND 2016 TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH ONLINE HEALTH INFORMATION SEARCH AND USE OF SELF-TRACKING DEVICES ASSOCIATE WITH SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS. WE HAVE USED DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS TO SHOW THAT, IN 2016, DISPARITIES STILL EXISTED IN HOW FINNS MAKE USE OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION FOUND ONLINE AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE NEW DEVICES SUCH AS SELF-TRACKING DEVICES. THE POPULATION LEVEL OF THIS STUDY AIDS US IN UNDERSTANDING THE DEGREE OF ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES USED BY DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS. WE SHOW THAT, DESPITE HAVING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, CERTAIN FACTORS INFLUENCE ACTUAL USAGE NEGATIVELY. LOOKING FORWARD, A KEY LIMITATION OF OUR STUDY IS A LACK OF MEASURES TO DETERMINE HOW THESE DEMOGRAPHICS USE HEALTH INFORMATION TO ADJUST THEIR BEHAVIOUR.

DFS ALLOW UNBANKED PEOPLE TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES THROUGH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, DFS FACE TOUGH CHALLENGES OF ADOPTION. REALISING THIS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY SUCH CHALLENGES AND DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK OF CHALLENGES BY UTILISING INTERPRETIVE STRUCTURAL MODELLING (ISM) AND FUZZY MICMAC APPROACH. THE AUTHORS EXPLORED 18 SUCH UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES CULLED FROM THE LITERATURE AND FURTHER GATHERED DATA FROM TWO SETS OF EXPERT PROFESSIONALS. IN THE FIRST PHASE, THE AUTHORS GATHERED DATA FROM 29 PROFESSIONALS FOLLOWED BY 18 PROFESSIONALS IN THE SECOND PHASE. ALL WERE PURSUING EXECUTIVE MBA PROGRAMME FROM A METROPOLITAN CITY IN SOUTH INDIA. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ISM AND FUZZY MICMAC PROVIDED A PRECISE SET OF DRIVING, LINKAGE AND DEPENDENT VARIABLES THAT WERE USED TO DERIVE A FRAMEWORK. FINDINGS ISM MODEL IS SPLIT IN EIGHT DIFFERENT LEVELS. THE BOTTOM LEVEL CONSISTS OF A KEY DRIVING CHALLENGE V11 (I.E. HIGH COST AND LOW RETURN RELATED PROBLEM), WHEREAS THE TOPMOST LEVEL CONSISTS OF TWO HIGHLY DEPENDENT CHALLENGES NAMELY V1 (I.E. RISK OF USING DIGITAL SERVICES) AND V14 (I.E. LACK OF TRUST). THE PRESCRIBED ISM MODEL SHOWS THE INVOLVEMENT OF ""HIGH COST AND LOW RETURN RELATED PROBLEM (V11)"", WHICH TRIGGERS FURTHER CHALLENGES OF DFS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE NONE OF THE EXISTING RESEARCH HAS EXPLORED KEY CHALLENGES TO DFS IN DETAIL NOR FORMULATED A FRAMEWORK FOR SUCH CHALLENGES. TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST PAPER ON DFS THAT ATTEMPTS TO COLLATE ITS CHALLENGES AND INCORPORATE THEM IN A HIERARCHICAL MODEL USING ISM AND FURTHER DIVIDE THEM INTO FOUR CATEGORIES OF FACTORS USING FUZZY MICMAC ANALYSIS.","SWANSEA UNIV, SCH MANAGEMENT, PGR, SWANSEA, W GLAM, WALES.;

FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS TWO CREATIVE WEB USERS AGED 80+, ASSISTED BY YOUNGER PROXY USERS, WERE INVOLVED IN PRELIMINARY ACTION RESEARCH. IT WAS AIMED AT FINDING PATTERNS OF INDUCING OLDER PEOPLE'S CREATIVITY AND SHARING THEIR WISDOM WITH THE GENERAL INTERNET AUDIENCE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONDUCTED ACTION RESEARCH IN TRANSFERRING WISDOM USING SILVER DIGITAL CONTENT IS HIGH. IT IS DEMONSTRATED WITH (A) QUALITATIVE PARTICIPANTS' INSIGHTS, (B) THE QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICS OF BLOG VISITS, AND (C) THE SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TOPICS COVERED IN THE CREATED CONTENT. LASTING FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND LOCATED WITHIN THE SPACE OF SOCIO-TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, THE RESULTS DELIVERED PATTERNS OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AIMED AT ENHANCING OLDER PEOPLE'S CREATIVITY ON THE WEB. THE INSIGHTS FROM THOSE TWO ACTION-BASED CASE STUDIES ENABLED THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HYPOTHESES. NEW DIRECTIONS OF FURTHER, MORE ADVANCED RESEARCH OF OLDER USERS' ACTIVITY ARE BASED ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES AT THE CROSSROADS OF PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY, GERONTOLOGY, AND HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION STUDIES. NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE PRESENTED, TO BE EXPLORED WITHIN THE SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF THE NEXT-GENERATION INTERNET. DEPARTING FROM THE ESTABLISHED CONCEPTS AND PRELIMINARY RESEARCH, THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZE THAT: (1) IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE NON-HUMAN TECHNOLOGY-BASED ASSISTANTS, HUMAN PROXY USERS SHOULD BE RESEARCHED; (2) VOICE ASSISTANT TECHNOLOGY COULD BECOME THE PRIMARY PROXY FOR A PRODUCTION OF SILVER DIGITAL CONTENT; AND (3) INTERACTIVE AND INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE THE SUBSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL ACTORS THAT PREVENT EXCLUSION AND DISENGAGEMENT. THE REMAINING RESEARCH QUESTION ALSO REFERS TO THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE A VIABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR PROXY USERS.","MARIA GRZEGORZEWSKA UNIV, INST PHILOSOPHY & SOCIOL, FAC APPL SOCIAL SCI, WARSAW, POLAND.;  NATL INFORMAT PROC INST, LAB INTERACT TECHNOL, WARSAW, POLAND.","TOCZYSKI, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MARIA GRZEGORZEWSKA UNIV, INST PHILOSOPHY & SOCIOL, FAC APPL SOCIAL SCI, WARSAW, POLAND.","BAYNE S, 2007; BILLER N, 2013; BRAKE D, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12042; BRANDTZAEG P, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-70284-1_30; BROWN C, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00369.x; CHOUDRIE J, 2010, DOI 10.1504/eg.2010.030925; CHOUDRIE J, 2013, DOI 10.1093/iwc/iws020; EDMONDSON R, 2015, DOI 10.1332/policypress/9781847425935.001.0001; EDMONDSON R, 2013; GLUCK J, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.21.4.679; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01411920902989227; KLIMCZUK A, 2011; KONIG S, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-0753-5_3247; KUMAR A, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2207676.2208386; MEACHAM J, 1990; MILLWARD P, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066; PRENSKY M, 2003; PRENSKY M, 2009; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424843; PRENSKY M, 2011; REEVES B, 1996; RICHARDSON J, 2015; RILEY T, 2013, DOI 10.1386/nl.11.1.51_1; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2010, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v7i1.660; SIAPERA E, 2011; TOCZYSKI P, 2017; WANG Q, 2012; ZBYRAD T, 2013",2,2019,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000660295100001,ISI,MARIA GRZEGORZEWSKA UNIV;NATL INFORMAT PROC INST,MARIA GRZEGORZEWSKA UNIV,NA,"TOCZYSKI P, 2019, FRONT SOCIOL","TOCZYSKI P, 2019, FRONT SOCIOL",POLAND;POLAND,10.3389/fsoc.2019.00015,NA,SOCIOLOGY,3,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,NA,WOS

THE PRESUPPOSITION OF BINARY DIVISIONS BETWEEN THE DICHOTOMIES 'USERS'-'NON-USERS' AND 'ANALOGUE'-'DIGITAL' IS PUT INTO QUESTION AS THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE TAKING UP OF PREDIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND THE EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT DISENGAGEMENT FROM CONTEMPORARY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. IN SHORT, THIS ARTICLE ASKS: WHAT DOES THE CONTEMPORARY REVIVAL OF ANALOGUE TECHNOLOGIES REVEAL ABOUT THE SOCIAL AND MATERIAL PROCESSES THAT CONSTITUTE 'USE', AND WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DIVISION OF THE TERMS ANALOGUE AND DIGITAL? TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON ASSEMBLAGE THEORY TO DESCRIBE THE MATERIAL AND EXPRESSIVE PERFORMATIVITY OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE - THAT IS, HOW INDIVIDUALS INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE COMES FROM THREE ILLUSTRATIVE CASES WHERE PREDIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE REPLACED AN EXISTING DIGITAL ALTERNATIVE.

IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS, THE MAJORITY OF USERS CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS POLITICALLY SOPHISTICATED CITIZENS WHO USE VAAS FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES AND CONFIRMATION OF THEIR PARTY PREFERENCE, BUT A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY USES VAAS TO LEARN ABOUT POLITICS AND MAKE AN INFORMED VOTE CHOICE. VAAS MIGHT, HOWEVER, PLAY A DIFFERENT ROLE IN SECOND-ORDER ELECTIONS, SINCE IN THESE ELECTIONS CAMPAIGN DYNAMICS AND INFORMATION SUPPLY ARE VERY DIFFERENT. IN THE CURRENT RESEARCH, WE APPLIED LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS ON USER DATA FROM A WIDELY USED DUTCH VAA (KIESKOMPAS) FOR A SUPRANATIONAL AND SEVERAL SUBNATIONAL ELECTIONS IN THE NETHERLANDS, TO TEST IF AN EXTANT TYPOLOGY OF VAA USERS FOR NATIONAL ELECTIONS COULD BE REPLICATED. WE FIND THAT THE TYPOLOGY CAN BE REPLICATED FOR MOST OF THESE ELECTIONS, BUT ALSO THAT THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE GROUPS OF USERS DIFFERS ACROSS ELECTIONS; IN ALL SECOND-ORDER ELECTIONS EXCEPT FOR THE PROVINCIAL ELECTIONS, MORE DOUBTERS AND SEEKERS ARE FOUND RELATIVE TO NATIONAL ELECTIONS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT VAAS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE STRONGER MOBILIZING POTENTIAL IN THESE SECOND-ORDER ELECTIONS.","UNIV AMSTERDAM, AMSTERDAM SCH COMMUN RES ASCOR, NIEUWE ACHTERGRACHT 166, NL-1018 WV AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;  TILBURG UNIV, TILBURG CTR COGNIT & COMMUN, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.;  VRIJE UNIV AMSTERDAM, DEPT COMMUN, BUITENVELDERTSELAAN 3, NL-1082 VA AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;  UNIV UTRECHT, UTRECHT INST LINGUIST, TRANS 10, NL-3512 JK UTRECHT, NETHERLANDS.","VAN DE POL, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AMSTERDAM, AMSTERDAM SCH COMMUN RES ASCOR, NIEUWE ACHTERGRACHT 166, NL-1018 WV AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.","ALVAREZ R, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1354068813519960; BIMBER B, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0894439314526559; BRANDTZAEG P, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.008; DE POL J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/19331681.2014.958794; DE VREESE C, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.0304-4130.2004.00171.x; DINAS E, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.electstud.2014.04.011; ERVIK B, 2012, DOI 10.1080/17457289.2011.642241; GEMENIS K, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.electstud.2014.06.010; HAGENAARS J, 2002, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511499531; HEATH A, 1999, DOI 10.1023/a:1006924510899; HIRZALLA F, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.534360; HIX S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.017; HOBOLT S, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-6765.2012.02057.x; HOBOLT S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.electstud.2010.09.020; HOOGHE M, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807082726; JEFFERY C, 2003, DOI 10.1177/09697764030103002; KAMOEN N, 2015, DOI 10.1080/07907184.2015.1099096; KAYE B K, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0736-5853(03)00037-6; KENSKI K, 2006, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem5002_1; KLEINNIJENHUIS J, 2017; KROUWEL A, 2012; LIU Y, 2005, DOI 10.1177/107769900508200410; MARSCHALL S, 2012; MARSCHALL S, 2014; MARSCHALL S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/09644008.2014.949681; MORRELL M, 2003, DOI 10.1086/378965; NORRIS P, 2001; OTJES S, 2015, DOI 10.1111/1467-9248.12089; R?TTER, 2015, DOI 10.5771/1430-6387-2014-4-389; REIF K, 1980, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-6765.1980.tb00737.x; SCHULTZE M, 2014, DOI 10.1002/1944-2866.poi352; SUDULICH M, 2014; VAN DE POL J, 2016; VAN DER BRUG W, 2016; VREESE CLAES H, 2007; WALL M, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1354068811436054; ZALLER J, 1992",1,2019,GOVERNMENT & LAW,WOS:000462291600003,ISI,UNIV AMSTERDAM;TILBURG UNIV;VRIJE UNIV AMSTERDAM;UNIV UTRECHT,UNIV AMSTERDAM,NA,"VAN DE POL J, 2019, ACTA POLIT","VAN DE POL J, 2019, ACTA POLIT",NETHERLANDS;NETHERLANDS;NETHERLANDS;NETHERLANDS,10.1057/s41269-018-0083-3,NA,POLITICAL SCIENCE,1,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,NETHERLANDS ORGANIZATION FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (NWO) [321-89-003],WOS

J. REG. STUD.,ARTICLE,REPUBLIC OF BASHKORTOSTAN; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL COMPETENCE; PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE; URBAN AND RURAL POPULATION; EDUCATION; LEVEL OF EDUCATION,INCLUSION; INDIA,"INTRODUCTION. THE ARTICLE IS OF RELEVANCE DUE TO THE ONGOING PROCESSES OF DIGITALIZATION OF THE ECONOMY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE INCREASING DEMANDS ON THE DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF SOCIETY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO REVIEW THE FACTORS CAUSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND CHARACTERIZE THE ROLE OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IN BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OF THE POPULATION (USING THE EXAMPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF BASHKORTOSTAN). MATERIALS AND METHODS. DATA FROM THE TERRITORIAL STATISTICS SERVICE AND OTHER OPEN SOURCES OF INFORMATION WERE USED AS THE MATERIALS FOR THE THEORETICAL PART OF THE STUDY. THE EXPERIMENTAL PART OF THE STUDY WAS BASED ON TESTING OF STUDENTS OF THE BASHKIR STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY CONDUCTED BY THE AUTHOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THEIR LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE. THE RESEARCH METHODS EMPLOYED INCLUDED COLLECTION, SYSTEMATIZATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA. RESULTS. THE STUDY HAS ANALYZED THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INDICATORS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE REPUBLIC OF BASHKORTOSTAN. THE MAIN FACTORS CAUSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE REPUBLIC HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED: THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE POPULATION ACCORDING TO TERRITORIAL CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL CRITERIA. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OF RURAL AND URBAN AREAS IS OF GREAT RELEVANCE FOR THE REPUBLIC OF BASHKORTOSTAN. THE ROLE OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN OVERCOMING DIGITAL INEQUALITY HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIATED; THE GROWTH OF THE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE AS A RESULT OF THEIR TRAINING HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION. THE ISSUE OF BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A COMPREHENSIVE ONE AND CAN BE SOLVED ONLY BY CONSOLIDATING THE EFFORTS OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY TO CREATE A UNIFIED DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT, WITH THE SUPPORT FROM REGIONAL AUTHORITIES AND INVOLVEMENT OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. THE RESULTS ARE OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE FOR TEACHERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS FOR REPRESENTATIVES OF REGIONAL IT-STRUCTURES. FURTHER AREAS OF STUDY OF THE PROBLEM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW WAYS OF FORMING AND DEVELOPING DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.","BASHKIR STATE AGR UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT & INFORMAT TECHNOL, 34 50 LETIYA OKTYABRYA ST, UFA 450001, RUSSIA.","SHAMSUTDINOVA, TM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), BASHKIR STATE AGR UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT & INFORMAT TECHNOL, 34 50 LETIYA OKTYABRYA ST, UFA 450001, RUSSIA.","ADHIKARI J, 2016, DOI 10.1108/itse-04-2016-0007; АРХИПОВА МЮ ARKHIPOVA M Y, 2018; BALA S, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jices-07-2017-0046; BRAGINA E, 2017; CARLSON A, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00909882.2018.1437279; CHAO C, 2016, DOI 10.1108/ajim-03-2016-0036; DOLAN J, 2016, DOI 10.1080/15391523.2015.1103147; DWIVEDI Y, 2016, DOI 10.1108/tg-01-2016-0006; DYATLOV S A, 2014; GAINANOV D A, 2015; HILL C, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1360080x.2018.1531211; HILLIER M, 2018, DOI 10.1080/01587919.2017.1418627; HUANG J, 2006, DOI 10.1108/02640470610660350; ITSIKSON A I, 2017, DOI 10.14529/.m170421; KUMAR B, 2018, DOI 10.1108/wjstsd-07-2017-0021; KUZNETSOV Y, 2014; LUO M, 2018, DOI 10.1108/itp-07-2016-0157; LYSENKO E A, 2014; MAVROU K, 2016, DOI 10.1108/jat-03-2016-0010; RICHMOND W, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jrme-02-2017-0006; SANNIKOVA T, 2018; SHAMSUTDINOVA T, 2018, DOI 10.17853/1994-5639-2018-2-180-195; SHAMSUTDINOVA T, 2013, DOI 10.21686/1818-4243-2013-6(101-36-44; SINGH S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/17482798.2017.1305604; TAVANI H, 2003, DOI 10.1108/14779960380000230; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VOLCHENKO O, 2016, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2016.5.10; YU B, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jd-10-2017-0148",0,2019,AREA STUDIES; BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000593216400006,ISI,BASHKIR STATE AGR UNIV,BASHKIR STATE AGR UNIV,NA,"SHAMSUTDINOVA TM, 2019, REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY- RUSS J REG STUD","SHAMSUTDINOVA TM, 2019, REGIONOLOGIYA-REGIONOLOGY- RUSS J REG STUD",RUSSIA,10.15507/2413-1407.106.027.201902.330-353,NA,AREA STUDIES; ECONOMICS,1,NATL RESEARCH OGAREV MORDOVIA STATE UNIV,BASHKIR STATE AGRAR IAN UNIVERSITY,WOS

BACKING UP FILES CAN PREVENT EMOTIONAL AND FINANCIAL LOSSES AND IMPROVE OVERALL USER EXPERIENCE. YET, WE FIND THAT LESS THAN HALF OF YOUNG ADULTS PERFORM MOBILE OR COMPUTER BACKUPS REGULARLY. TO UNDERSTAND WHY, WE MODEL THE FACTORS THAT DRIVE MOBILE AND COMPUTER BACKUP BEHAVIOR, AND CHANGES IN THAT BEHAVIOR OVER TIME, USING DATA FROM A PANEL SURVEY OF 384 DIVERSE YOUNG ADULTS. WE DEVELOP A SET OF MODELS THAT EXPLAIN 37% AND 38% OF THE VARIANCE IN REPORTED MOBILE AND COMPUTER BACKUP BEHAVIORS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE MODELS SHOW CONSISTENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INTERNET SKILLS AND BACKUP FREQUENCY ON BOTH MOBILE AND COMPUTER DEVICES. WE FIND THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP HOLDS LONGITUDINALLY: INCREASES IN INTERNET SKILLS LEAD TO INCREASED FREQUENCY OF COMPUTER BACKUPS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT DRIVES YOUNG ADULTS' BACKUP BEHAVIOR.

THE RESULTING MODELS ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND WITH A HIGH PREDICTIVE POWER. AGE, EDUCATION AND LEVELS OF INTERNET AND COMPUTER SKILLS ARE ALL SIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING THE ADOPTION OF ANY OF THE THREE SERVICES; AS ARE GENDER AND INCOME, BUT JUST FOR ECOMMERCE AND EBANKING.

ADDITIONALLY, RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SES AND SECOND SCREENING FOR NEWS IS INDIRECT, MEDIATED THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL ACCESS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS ENGAGEMENT.","UNIV ALABAMA, DEPT JOURNALISM & CREAT MEDIA, TUSCALOOSA, AL USA.;  UNIV VIENNA, DEPT COMMUN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;  UNIV WISCONSIN, SCH JOURNALISM & MASS COMMUN, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.;  UNIV WISCONSIN, LATIN AMER CARIBBEAN & IBERIAN STUDIES PROGRAM, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.","BARNIDGE, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, REESE PHIFER 432A, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35401 USA.","ALI A J, 1999; ALLIN1SOCIAL, 2015; ANSTEAD N, 2015, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12102; ANSTEAD N, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1940161211415519; AUVERSET L, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2056305116662170; BARNIDGE M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2017.1309416; BARNIDGE M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/10584609.2016.1235639; BARRY M, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815625944; BENTIVEGNA S, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115595526; BOYD D, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x; BRUNDIDGE J, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01509.x; CHADWICK A, 2016; CHOI B, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.048; COLOMBIA R, 2015; D'HEER E, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1354856514543451; D'HEER E, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0267323114544866; D'HEER E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.952318; DANE, 2014; DE ZUNIGA H, 2017, DOI 10.1080/10584609.2016.1227000; DE ZUNIGA H, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01574.x; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; ELLISON N, 2006; ENOCH Y, 2006, DOI 10.1080/02680510600713045; FITZGERALD J, 2012; FREELON D, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.952659; GAZIANO C, 1997, DOI 10.1177/107769909707400202; GIGLIETTO F, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12085; DE ZUNIGA H, 2015, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12174; DE ZUNIGA H, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12103; GILLESPIE M, 2015; HALLVARD M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1527476415616194; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00396.x; HARRIS C, 2017, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0175011; HILBERT M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.01.006; HILBERT M, 2014, DOI 10.1002/asi.23020; HOFFMAN D, 1998, DOI 10.1126/science.280.5362.390; HORNING M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.023; IANNELLI L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1006658; KARL T, 1990, DOI 10.2307/422302; KATZ J, 1997, DOI 10.1145/248448.248464; KIM J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.11.012; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LIVINGSTONE S, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342697; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; LOPEZ-SINTAS J, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0894439310390611; MARKUS M, 1987, DOI 10.1177/009365087014005003; MCGREGOR S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2016.1273924; NORRIS, 2000; NORRIS P, 2001; NORTH S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180802109006; NOTTEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1093/esr/jcn071; OAKES J, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00073-4; POND P, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1527476415616190; POUSHTER J, 2016; PUTNAM R, 2000; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; RICE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5; RODRIGUEZ C, 2008; ROJAS H, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2057047315619421; ROJAS H, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01475.x; SELVA D, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1527476415616192; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SHAH D, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0093650205279209; SOMI M, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2008.02009.x; TELLES E, 2014, DOI 10.1086/679252; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2016.12.012; VACCARI C, 2015, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12187; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VELASQUEZ A, 2017, DOI 10.1177/2056305117696521; VERGEER M, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1093526; WARREN M, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.001; WARSCHAUER M, 2004; WEI L, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01578.x; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; WELLS C, 2016, DOI 10.1057/fp.2016.4; WOHN Y, 2016, DOI 10.5210/fm.v16i3.3368; WORLD B, 2015; YANG J, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444811401708; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",7,2019,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000454937700004,ISI,UNIV ALABAMA;UNIV VIENNA;UNIV WISCONSIN;UNIV WISCONSIN,UNIV ALABAMA,NA,"BARNIDGE M, 2019, SOC SCI COMPUT REV","BARNIDGE M, 2019, SOC SCI COMPUT REV",AUSTRIA;USA;USA;USA,10.1177/0894439317750840,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON GRADUATE SCHOOL RESEARCH COMMITTEE; DEPARTAMENTO ADMINISTRATIVO DE CIENCIAS, TECHNOLOGIA, E INNOVACION DE COLOMBIA (COLCIENCIAS)",WOS

MODERN-DAY MANUFACTURING IS LARGELY DEFINED BY ITS FUNDAMENTAL INTEGRATION WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMATIZATION. DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AUTOMATED PROCESS FLOWS, MANAGERIAL TOOLS, AND WEB-BASED CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION ARE AMONG NUMEROUS ADVANCEMENTS THAT OFFER MODERNIZED PRODUCERS WITH UNPRECEDENTED SCOPE FOR EXPANSION AND OUTREACH. HOWEVER, FOR THOSE TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES THAT RELY STRICTLY ON MANUAL SKILLS AND PEOPLE-CENTRIC SYSTEMS, THEIR INVOLUNTARY OBJECTIVITY WITH NEW PARADIGMS POSES A THREAT OF INDUCING RECESSION-LIKE CONDITIONS, COMPROMISING LIVELIHOODS, DEVALUING IDENTITIES AND LEGACIES, AND NULLIFYING SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE AT TIMES BUILT UPON CENTURIES OF DEDICATED PRACTICE. THE PAPER THUS SHOWCASES HOW A DESIGN MEDIATION PROJECT 'ANTIAMNESIA' IS ADDRESSING THE OBSERVABLE DIVIDE BY: ACKNOWLEDGING THAT TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING AFFECTED COMMUNITIES, ARE NOT ALWAYS A PART OF THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS FROM MANUAL TO DIGITAL; ARTICULATING STRATEGIES TO CAPITALIZE UPON THE ADVANTAGES PRESENTED BY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS FOR INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT, AND VICE-VERSA; RECOVERING AND RE-CONTEXTUALIZING THE ASSOCIATED SOCIO-CULTURAL AND MATERIAL NARRATIVES WITH A VIEW TO REACTIVATE CREATIVE AND COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL. CORRESPONDINGLY, THE MEDIATION DISTANCES ITSELF FROM COMPARABLE INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY VIEW INTRODUCING STANDARDIZATION AND SYSTEM-CENTRIC PRODUCTION IN TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIAL SETTINGS AS ESSENTIAL TO GAIN SOCIO-ECONOMIC PARITY. IT INSTEAD EMPLOYS NEW TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY DIGITAL MEDIA, AS A STRATEGIC INSTRUMENT FOR DEVELOPING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF RELATED HUMAN, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL VALUES, AND FOR SUPPORTING KNOWLEDGE RECOVERY AND CAPACITY BUILDING WITHIN THE PRACTICE BASES. BY ENCOURAGING THE PRACTITIONERS TO DEFINE THEIR OWN NARRATIVES, COMMUNICATION PARAMETERS, AND MEANS TO SELF-ACTUALIZE, THE PROJECT ANTI-AMNESIA POSITIONS DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AS A REGENERATIVE AGENT, IN PLACE OF A PARADIGM SHIFT THAT INVALIDATES PRECURSORY NONCONFORMIST CREATIVE HUMAN ENTERPRISE.","UNIV PORTO, PORTO, PORTUGAL.","CHATTERJEE, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV PORTO, PORTO, PORTUGAL.","ALBINO C, 2017; DEALMEIDA P, 2016; DEALMEIDA P, 2012; FLECK J, 1992; GOMES A, 2016",2,2019,COMMUNICATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000589892600003,ISI,UNIV PORTO,UNIV PORTO,NA,"CHATTERJEE A, 2019, NA","CHATTERJEE A, 2019, NA",PORTUGAL,978-989-54489-5-1,978-989-54489-5-1,"COMMUNICATION; COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",2,IPCA-INST POLITECNICO CAVADO & AVE,"PORTUGAL 2020; FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, PORTUGAL (ID+/UNEXPECTED MEDIA LAB) [POCI-01-0145-FEDER-029022]; EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND",WOS

EDUCATIONAL POVERTY IS A MULTIFACETED PROBLEM; IT IS THE RESULT OF SEVERAL INTERRELATED ISSUES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IT CAN BE ASSESSED BY INTEGRATING DIFFERENT INDICATORS: EARLY SCHOOL-LEAVING RATES, RESULTS ON COMPETENCES IN SCHOOL EDUCATION (E.G. OCSE PISA), THE EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT OFFERED BY THE TERRITORY WHERE CHILDREN TAKE PART TO RECREATIONAL, SPORT, CULTURAL EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES OFFER ENORMOUS POTENTIAL FOR LEARNING, AND CAN THEREFORE BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN REDUCING EDUCATIONAL POVERTY. IN 2018, THE AUTHORITY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS OF PALERMO (ITALY) HAS COORDINATED A RESEARCH NAMED ""HABITS AND LIFESTYLES OF ADOLESCENTS IN PALERMO"" AIMED AT INVESTIGATING THE FACTORS THAT CAN POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY MODIFY THE LEVEL OF EDUCATIONAL POVERTY. DATA ON THE SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR THE ADOLESCENTS AND HOW BOYS AND GIRLS EXPLOIT THE POTENTIALS OFFERED BY THESE SERVICES (I.E.: THEIR HABITS AND LIFESTYLES) HAVE BEEN GATHERED.

HOWEVER, CONTRIBUTIONS FROM SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY AND SOCIAL MARKEDNESS THEORY INDICATE THAT SISD CAN ACTIVATE A STIGMATIZED IDENTITY AND THUS BE PERCEIVED UNFAVORABLY BY THEIR TARGET AUDIENCE. WE IDENTIFY TWO MECHANISMS BY WHICH FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AFFECT A DIGITALLY DISADVANTAGED PERSON'S ADOPTION DECISION: (1) ADOPTION DECISION AS SHAPED THROUGH TECHNOLOGY PERCEPTIONS (I.E., PERCEIVED USEFULNESS, PERCEIVED EASE OF USE, AND PERCEIVED ACCESS BARRIERS), AND (2) ADOPTION DECISION AS SHAPED THROUGH MARKED STATUS AWARENESS (I.E., STIGMA CONSCIOUSNESS). WE TEST OUR CONTEXTUALIZED RESEARCH MODEL ON DIGITALLY DISADVANTAGED USERS WITH PHYSICAL AND/OR SENSORY DISABILITIES. RESULTS OF OUR MEDIATION ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN FROM SISD USE (I.E., THOSE WITH GREATER PERCEIVED FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS) ARE DOUBLY DISADVANTAGED: AS A GROUP, THEY FIND IT MORE CHALLENGING TO USE SISD AND ARE ALSO MORE SENSITIVE TO THE FEAR OF BEING MARKED AS DISADVANTAGED OR VULNERABLE.","UNIV MANNHEIM, GRAD SCH ECON & SOCIAL SCI, INFORMAT SYST, MANNHEIM, GERMANY.;

HENCE, IT IS ESPECIALLY VALUABLE FOR BRANDS TO INVESTIGATE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SENIOR INTERNET REGULAR USER (SIRU) AS RECIPIENT OF THE ADVERTISING MESSAGE. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DISPLAY THE RESULTS OF A STUDY PERFORMED ON 184 INDIVIDUALS, FROM 65 TO 84 YEARS OLD, LIVING IN SEGOVIA CAPITAL (SPAIN) AND WITH ACTIVE AGEING HABITS. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE SENIORS AND, THEREFORE, THE DIFFICULTY OF CONTACTING THEM BY MEANS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. HALF OF THE INTERVIEWEES ARE SIRU.

HOW DO EMERGING-MARKET MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES UTILIZE CROSS-BORDER MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS TO IMPROVE INNOVATION QUALITY IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY ERA? TO SHED LIGHT ON THIS QUESTION, WE COMBINED THE LITERATURE ON NETWORK BALANCE WITH A DIGITAL GAP PERSPECTIVE. WE CONDUCTED A BOOTSTRAP REPEATED-SAMPLING ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE OF 146 OVERSEAS MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS CONDUCTED BY CHINESE-LISTED MANUFACTURING COMPANIES BETWEEN 2001 AND2016. WE FOUND THAT NETWORK-EMBEDDING BALANCE HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF POST-M&A DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INNOVATION, AND THAT CHINA'S DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT HAS NOT PROMOTED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN NETWORK BALANCE AND INNOVATION QUALITY. IN THE PRESENCE OF A WIDE DIGITAL GAP BETWEEN A FIRM'S HOME AND HOST COUNTRIES, NETWORK BALANCE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF POST-OVERSEAS M&A DOMESTIC INNOVATION; CONVERSELY, WHEN THIS GAP IS NARROW, A FIRM CAN USE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NETWORK BALANCE AND THE HOST COUNTRY'S DIGITAL LEVEL TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF ITS INTERNATIONAL INNOVATION. CHINESE MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES CAN ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN HIGHLY COMPLEX TACIT KNOWLEDGE BY INCREASING THEIR DIGITAL LEVEL. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXPLAIN A NEW MECHANISM THAT DIGITAL ECONOMY EMERGING-MARKET MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISES CAN USE TO CONSTRUCT A BALANCED NETWORK AND THUS GAIN GLOBAL INNOVATION ADVANTAGES.","BEIJING UNIV POSTS & TELECOMMUN, SCH ECON & MANAGEMENT, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.;  VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIV ARAS, FAC ECON SCI COMP SCI & ENGN, ARAD, ROMANIA.","CHEN, Y (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), BEIJING UNIV POSTS & TELECOMMUN, SCH ECON & MANAGEMENT, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.","AHAMMAD M F, 2014; ALCACER J, 2016, DOI 10.1057/jibs.2016.22; BHARADWAJ A, 2013, DOI 10.25300/misq/2013/37:2.3; BROUTHERS K, 2016, DOI 10.1057/jibs.2015.20; CHEN F, 2017, DOI 10.1080/09537325.2016.1261102; COOMBS J, 2009, DOI 10.1002/sej.74; FREEMAN C, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0048-7333(91)90072-x; GRAEBNER M, 2017, DOI 10.5465/annals.2014.0078; HERRIGEL G, 2013, DOI 10.1111/j.2042-5805.2012.01046.x; IURKOV V, 2018, DOI 10.1057/s41267-017-0089-5; KOBRIN S, 2017, DOI 10.1002/gsj.1158; LAVIE D, 2008, DOI 10.1287/orsc.1070.0341; LIANG C, 2018; MAKRI M, 2010, DOI 10.1002/smj.829; MANYIKA J, 2016; NAMBISAN S, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.infoandorg.2018.04.003; PATEL P C, 2014; PEZDERKA N, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ibusrev.2010.06.004; PURANAM P, 2009, DOI 10.1287/orsc.1090.0422; RAI A, 2012; WILLIAMSON P, 2016, DOI 10.1002/gsj.1124; YOO Y, 2010, DOI 10.1287/isre.1100.0322; YOON H, 2016, DOI 10.1080/09537325.2015.1093618; ZHANG J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/09585192.2014.908316; ZOU H, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s11575-008-0012-1",2,2019,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS; MATHEMATICS,WOS:000487267900012,ISI,BEIJING UNIV POSTS AND TELECOMMUN;VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIV ARAS,BEIJING UNIV POSTS AND TELECOMMUN,NA,"LI F, 2019, ECON COMPUT ECON CYBERN STUD","LI F, 2019, ECON COMPUT ECON CYBERN STUD",CHINA;ROMANIA,10.24818/18423264/53.3.19.12,NA,"ECONOMICS; MATHEMATICS, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS",2,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,"MINISTERY OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION, CNCS - UEFISCDI, WITHIN PNCDI III [PN-III-P1-1.1-PD-2016-0780]",WOS

DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE DIGITAL ETHICS ARE DISCUSSED TOO. THESE CONCEPTIONS ARE DIVIDED INTO CLASSIC AND MODERN, REALIST AND FUTURIST, ALARMIST AND NON-ALARMIST. INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIGITAL ETHICS IS ANALYZED ON THE BASE OF N. WIENER'S AND J. WEIZENBAUM'S WORKS. POSITIONS OF ALARMISM AND NON-ALARMISM IN THE DIGITAL ETHICS AND CONCEPTIONS OF THE DIGITAL ONTOLOGY BY R. CAPURRO AND L. FLORIDI ARE THE SUBJECT OF ANALYSIS IN THE ARTICLE. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAYED TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF THE DIGITAL EPOCH BECAUSE OF THEIR IMPACT ON THE HUMANS, SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT THE PROBLEMS OF UBIQUITOUS ROBOTIZATION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MACHINE ETHICS AND FREE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET ARE CONSIDERED FROM THE ETHICAL POINT OF VIEW. DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES' IMPACT ON HUMAN EXISTENCE IS ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF EQUITY ABSENCE IN USING THE DIGITAL ACHIEVEMENTS, OF HUMAN INTERACTION WITH TECHNICAL INTERMEDIARIES AND OF ""HOMO DIGITAL'S"" FORMATION. IN GENERAL, THE AUTHORS TRY TO FORM AN OBJECTIVE VIEW ON DIGITAL ETHICS, DIFFERED FROM THE OUTDATED HYPOTHESES OF SCIENCE FICTION AND FROM ITS POPULAR ALARMIST INTERPRETATIONS. THEY ALSO TRY TO INTEGRATE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND HUMAN VALUES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE FIRST ONES WON'T CONFLICT THE LAST ONES BUT PROTECT AND DEVELOP THEM.

THESE WOULD PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DIGITAL ERA TO PRODUCE RELEVANT KNOWLEDGE AND TO TRAIN NEW GENERATIONS OF WORKERS.

THE CYBERSPACE OF THE NETWORK PERFORMS NOT ONLY A SOCIAL AND COMMUNICATIVE FUNCTION, BUT ALSO POSSESSES SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL POTENTIAL. ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS HAVE BECOME A PHENOMENON OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIFE IN MODERN RUSSIA AND INFLUENCE ITS DYNAMICS AND CHARACTER, ACTING AS A LEGITIMISING POWER MECHANISM. INTEGRATION OF PUBLIC POLICY INTO VIRTUAL SOCIAL SPACE CAUSES FORMATION OF NETWORK FORMS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION FOR CITIZENS AND THEIR NEW ONLINE IDENTITIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE SPECIFICS OF ONLINE POLITICAL INTERACTIONS LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIAL DIALOGUE, WHICH IS ALREADY DIFFICULT IN RUSSIA DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF CLEARLY EXPRESSED IDEOLOGICAL AND VALUE DIFFERENCES IN SOCIETY. THE SOCIAL INTERNET SPACE SERVES AS A VIRTUAL PROJECTION OF SOCIAL CONTRADICTIONS AND ACTS AS AN ARENA FOR THE CLASH OF POLITICAL INTERESTS. SOCIAL NETWORKS, ALTHOUGH DECLARING THE PRINCIPLES OF SOLIDARITY, SELF-ORGANIZATION AND COLLECTIVE IDENTITY, ARE IN FACT STRATIFIED, DO NOT IMPLY EQUALITY OF USERS, NOR DO THEY PROVIDE A BALANCE OF THEIR INTERESTS. NETWORKS PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLITICAL MANIPULATION AND INFLUENCE CURATION OF PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS. IN RUSSIA, POLITICAL POWER USES A NUMBER OF TOOLS TO IMPLEMENT ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL OVER THE DIGITAL SOCIAL SPACE, WHICH MAKES ONE QUESTION VIABILITY OF THE NETWORK SOCIETY PROJECT AS A MODERN POLICY-MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVE. NEVERTHELESS, IT IS HOPED THAT AS THE NETWORK INVOLVEMENT OF RUSSIAN CITIZENS INCREASES, THE POLITICAL POTENTIAL OF THE VIRTUAL COMMUNICATION SPACE WILL INCREASE, TOO.","RUSSIAN ACAD SCI, FED CTR THEORET & APPL SOCIOL, INST SOCIOL, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","MIKHAYLENOK, OM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), RUSSIAN ACAD SCI, FED CTR THEORET & APPL SOCIOL, INST SOCIOL, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","ABDRAKHMANOVA G, 2018; ABDRAKHMANOVA G, 2018; BALUEV D, 2016, DOI 10.17223/1998863x/33/16; BAUMAN Z, 2008; BYKOV I, 2011; BYKOV I A, 2013; CASTELLS M, 2016; DI C, 2015; MALTSEVA D, 2018, DOI 10.7868/s0132162518040013; MIROSHNICHENKO I, 2017, DOI 10.17976/jpps/2017.02.06; MIROSHNICHENKO INNA V, 2016; NEYASKIN G N, 2010; РЫКОВ ЮРИЙ ГЕОРГИЕВИЧ RYKOV Y, 2015; SKURATOV A B, 2017, DOI 10.14529/ssh170113; SMORGUNOV L V, 2014; VOLKOV D, 2017; VOLKOV D, 2017; ВОЛОДЕНКОВ СВ VOLODENKOV S, 2014; ZHEZHKO-BRAUN I V, 2017",1,2019,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000465626300010,ISI,INST SOCIOL,INST SOCIOL,NA,"MIKHAYLENOK OM, 2019, SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLED","MIKHAYLENOK OM, 2019, SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLED",RUSSIA,10.31857/s013216250004012-6,NA,SOCIOLOGY,1,IZDATELSTVO NAUKA,NA,WOS

SOCIOL.,ARTICLE,SOCIAL INEQUALITY; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; INFORMATION SOCIETY; INFORMATION-COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; DIGITALIZATION; INTERNET,NA,"THE ARTICLE CONSIDERS FEATURES AND TRENDS OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT IN RUSSIA THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS DIGITALIZATION INCLUDING THE STRATEGIC TASK OF REDUCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH CENTURY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE DEVELOPS AS A NEW FORM OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY DETERMINED BY INFORMATION-COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. TODAY THERE IS NO SINGLE APPROACH TO THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE (DIGITAL INEQUALITY). USUALLY, AS A METHODOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY, RESEARCHERS USE A THREE-LEVEL MODEL OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: (1) THE DIFFERENCE IN ACCESS TO NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (AVAILABILITY OR LACK OF MATERIAL RESOURCES) SUCH AS SPECIAL DEVICES (SMARTPHONES, COMPUTERS, ETC.) AND ALSO AVAILABILITY OF INTERNET ACCESS AND ITS QUALITY (SPEED, PRICE, ETC.); (2) THE DIFFERENCE IN SKILLS NECESSARY FOR THE EFFECTIVE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (ABILITY TO GET ACCESS TO CONTENT, TO PRODUCE IT, TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT OF INTERACTION)' (3) LIFE CHANCES AND OPPORTUNITIES DETERMINED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH ARE MOST DIFFICULT TO MEASURE DUE TO DIGITIZATION OF CERTAIN SPHERES OF SOCIETY. DIGITALIZATION IS A PRIORITY FOR THE STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE RUSSIAN SOCIETY WHICH INCLUDES THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN MAIN SPHERES OF SOCIAL LIFE (EDUCATION, HEALTHCARE, ETC.) AND CHANGES IN THE WAYS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SOCIETY AND THE STATE (""E-GOVERNMENT""). BASED ON THE DATA OF STATISTICS AND RESEARCH FOR 2015-2017, THE AUTHORS CONSIDER PERSPECTIVES TO OVERCOME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE UNDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION SOCIETY IN RUSSIA AND IDENTIFY MAIN RISKS AND NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF ATTEMPTS TO ACCELERATE ITS DIGITALIZATION.","LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, LENINSKIYE GORY 1, MOSCOW 119991, RUSSIA.","DOBRINSKAYA, DE (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, LENINSKIYE GORY 1, MOSCOW 119991, RUSSIA.","BARNEY D, 2004; BRANDTZAEG P B, 2010; CASTELLS M, 2009; CHEN W, 2005; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1086/ahr/69.3.805; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HASSAN R, 2004; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; JUNG J, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004006; LYADOVA A V, 2016; NORRIS P, 2001; OSIPOVA N, 2017; OSIPOVA N G, 2014; POLYAKOVA N L, 2014; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROGERS E, 1995; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2005; STERN M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00302.x; STEYAERT J, 2002; TOPOL E, 2016; URRY J, 2003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VOLCHENKO O, 2016, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2016.5.10",11,2019,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000459124200009,ISI,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,NA,"DOBRINSKAYA DE, 2019, RUDN J SOCIOL","DOBRINSKAYA DE, 2019, RUDN J SOCIOL",RUSSIA,10.22363/2313-2272-2019-19-1-108-120,NA,SOCIOLOGY,14,PEOPLES FRIENDSHIP UNIV RUSSIA,RUSSIAN FOUNDATION FOR HUMANITIES [18-011-01106],WOS

THIS ETHNIC GROUP IS A PARADIGMATIC CASE AMONG SOCIALLY UNDERPRIVILEGED GROUPS IN SPAIN; EXCLUDED FROM INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY, THEY APPEAR TO BE FACING A SIMILAR SITUATION IN THE POST-INDUSTRIAL ERA. WE, THEREFORE, SOUGHT TO EXPLORE THE DIGITAL EXPERIENCES OF MINORS FROM THIS GROUP IN ORDER TO STUDY SOCIAL AND DIGITAL EXCLUSION/INCLUSION AMONG THEM. THE RESEARCH STRATEGY TOOK A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH, COVERING BOTH OFFLINE AND ONLINE BEHAVIOUR. WE FOCUSED ON THE RESULTS OF FIELDWORK UNDERTAKEN IN SPAIN DURING 2017. IN ALL, INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 17 ADOLESCENTS (AGED 11 TO 18) AS WELL AS WITH SEVERAL SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WERE PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE MINORS. GIVEN THAT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME A PREREQUISITE FOR THE WELFARE OF CHILDREN AND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR RIGHTS, THE ISSUE TENDS TO CENTRE ON THREE MAIN AREAS, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE THREE PS: PROVISION, PARTICIPATION, AND PROTECTION. AS SUCH, THE ANALYSIS OF INEQUALITY WAS BASED ON THESE AREAS.

TOMSK. GOS. UNIV. FILOS.-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA,ARTICLE,SOCIAL INEQUALITY; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; DIGITAL INCLUSION; DIGITAL EXCLUSION; DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICY,NA,"THIS ARTICLE IS DEDICATED TO THE EXPLICATION OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND INCLUSION. THE HEURISTIC POTENTIAL OF THE E-INCLUSION CONCEPT LIES IN THE OVERCOMING OF SUCH A LIMITATION AS A BINARY EXPLANATION OF DIGITAL DIVISION. THREE LEVELS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY WERE DISTINGUISHED IN WESTERN STUDIES: IN ACCESS, METHODS AND OUTCOMES OF ICT USE (M. RAGNEDDA, E. HARGITTAI, A. VAN DEURSEN, J. VAN DIJK, E. HELSPER). OPERATIONALIZATION OF DIGITAL INCLUSION REFLECTS FOCUSING OF RESEARCH LENSES ON DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE AND QUALITY OF ENGAGEMENT IN ICT. DIGITAL INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION MARK SOCIAL POSITIONS IN THE CONTINUUM OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY. MECHANISMS OF EXCLUSION OPERATE ON MICRO-, MESO-, AND MACROLEVELS. THE CONCEPT OF RELATIVE DIGITAL DEPRIVATION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE, OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE DIGITAL EXCLUSION. SCIENTIFIC APPROACHES OF DIGITAL AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION COVARIANCE (I. MARIEN, L. VAN AUDENHOVE, E. HELSPER) ARE DESCRIBED. PRACTICES OF EXCLUSION/INCLUSION ARE REALIZED IN FOUR FIELDS (ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, SOCIAL, AND INDIVIDUAL), WHICH HAVE TWO PERSPECTIVES: ONLINE AND OFFLINE. PREDICTORS OF EXCLUSION, INCLUDING DIGITAL (ACCESS, SKILLS, MOTIVATION, ETC.), SOCIOECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, ARE CHARACTERIZED. FOR THE DETECTION OF RISK GROUPS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE FUNCTIONING OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION MECHANISMS WHICH TRANSCEND SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE STRATA. THE CORNER STONES FOR THE POLICY OF E-INCLUSION ARE INTER-SECTOR PARTNERSHIP; COMBINATION OF A TARGETED APPROACH TO VULNERABLE STRATA WITH INCLUSION OF ALL CITIZENS; DEVELOPMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE, DIGITAL COMPETENCE, AND NETWORKS OF SUPPORT; DESIGNING OF E-GOVERNMENT SITES, DEVICES AND SERVICES ORIENTED TOWARDS USERS; MONITORING OF POLICY; COLLECTING DATA CONCERNING PEOPLE'S DIGITAL SKILLS. THE POLICY OF DIGITAL INCLUSION IS DIRECTED AT THE EXTENSION OF SUPPLY AND STIMULATION OF DEMAND FOR ICT. THE POLICY OF SUPPLY IS RELEVANT AT THE STAGE OF OVERCOMING DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN ACCESS GRADATIONS. DISPARITY IN METHODS AND OUTCOMES OF ICT USE DEMANDS IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL SKILLS POLICY.","KUBAN STATE UNIV, KRASNODAR, RUSSIA.","PLOTICHKINA, NV (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KUBAN STATE UNIV, KRASNODAR, RUSSIA.","AL-MUWIL A, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10796-019-09914-0; HELSPER E J, 2019; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1111/comt.12110; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; MARIEN I, 2012; MARIEN I, 2015; MORI C, 2011; OECD, 2019, DOI 10.1787/df80bc12-en; OECD, 2017; OESD, 2020, DOI 10.1787/dc930adc-en; PLOTICHKINA N, 2020, DOI 10.20542/0131-2227-2020-64-4-70-83; RAGNEDDA M, 2018; RAGNEDDA M, 2018; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; THE UK G, 2017",0,2020,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000612738600020,ISI,KUBAN STATE UNIV,KUBAN STATE UNIV,NA,"PLOTICHKINA NV, 2020, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA","PLOTICHKINA NV, 2020, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA",RUSSIA,10.17223/1998863x/58/20,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",1,TOMSK STATE UNIV,RUSSIAN FOUNDATION FOR BASIC RESEARCH [18-011-00975],WOS

THE DATA COLLECTION WAS CARRIED OUT WITH AN AD HOC QUESTIONNAIRE THAT IS ANSWERED ON A LIKERT-TYPE SCALE OF FIVE CATEGORIES. RELIABILITY IS HIGH (CRONBACH'S ALPHA = 0.890). THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MAJORITY OF THE STUDENTS HAVE A MOBILE PHONE, LAPTOP OR TABLET, WITH INTERNET ACCESS; BUT 14.8% RECOGNIZE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO FACE THE CURRENT SITUATION. 40.6% HAVE MOVED TO LIVE THE CONFINEMENT IN ANOTHER PLACE (FAMILY HOME, SECOND RESIDENCE, ETC.)

USING COOPETITIVE-BASED VIEW, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ANTECEDENTS AND DRIVERS OF INFRASTRUCTURE SHARING (IS) AMONG LOCAL AND MULTINATIONAL MOBILE NETWORK OPERATORS (MNOS) IN AFRICA. BASED ON 21 INTERVIEWS WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IN SEVEN SUB-SAHARA AFRICAN (SSA) COUNTRIES, WE DEVELOP AN INTEGRATIVE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY/MARKET, TECHNOLOGICAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT IS BETWEEN MNOS. WE FIND EVIDENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS SHAPING THE IMPACT OF THE INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS ON FIRMS' PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE IN COOPETITIVE STRATEGIES. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IN CONTEXTS WITH LOW-LEVEL IS, INADEQUATE REGULATORY INTERVENTIONS MEAN THAT THE EXISTING MARKET CONDITIONS ARE REPRODUCED, LEADING TO FURTHER COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOURS FROM MNOS. FOR HIGH-LEVEL IS, MNOS TEND TO ENGAGE IN FURTHER COOPETITIVE STRATEGIES THROUGH STRATEGIC LEARNING AND COOPERATE TO RESOLVE TECHNOLOGICAL INCOMPATIBILITIES AND ENGAGE IN STANDARDS SETTINGS. WE EXTEND THE EXISTING SCHOLARLY WORKS ON COOPETITION AND IS LITERATURE BY PROVIDING AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF THE OBSTACLES FACED BY MNOS IN ADOPTING IS. THE STUDY FURTHER HIGHLIGHTS THAT IS REQUIRES A SHIFT FROM THE COMPETITIVE-BASED LOGIC TO A DYNAMIC, COOPETITIVE ONE, WHICH IS NONETHELESS CHALLENGING TO ACHIEVE WITH LIMITED INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND SUPPORT.","NORTHUMBRIA UNIV, NEWCASTLE BUSINESS SCH, CITY CAMPUS EAST 1, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 8ST, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.;  NEWCASTLE BUSINESS SCH, CITY CAMPUS EAST 1, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 8ST, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.","ARAKPOGUN, EO (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NORTHUMBRIA UNIV, NEWCASTLE BUSINESS SCH, CITY CAMPUS EAST 1, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 8ST, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.","ADENIRAN D, 2019; AMANKWAH-AMOAH J, 2020, DOI 10.1002/tie.22136; AMANKWAH-AMOAH J, 2019, DOI 10.1002/sd.1950; AMANKWAH-AMOAH J, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2018.01.003; AMANKWAH-AMOAH J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.11.022; AMANKWAH-AMOAH J, 2015, DOI 10.1002/tie.21677; ANGELES R, 2013; ANTONOPOULOS A, 2015, DOI 10.1109/mcom.2015.7105671; ARAKPOGUN E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.05.003; ASONGU S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2017.01.026; AWA H, 2016, DOI 10.1080/23311975.2016.1179613; BARRETTA A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.scaman.2008.03.005; BATUO M, 2015, DOI 10.1353/jda.2015.0005; BELL P, 2017; BENGTSSON M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.05.003; BLANCO E, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.07.012; BOUNCKEN R, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.03.019; BOUNCKEN R, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2019.02.002; BOUNCKEN R, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.01.004; BOUNCKEN R, 2012, DOI 10.1142/s1363919612500284; BRANDENBURGER A, 1995; CLAUSS T, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2018.12.005; COHEN T, 2008; CRASA & I, 2016; CZAKON W, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2019.03.001; CZAKON W, 2014, DOI 10.1504/ijbe.2014.058022; CZERNEK K, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2015.07.009; D'ESTE P, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2007.05.002; DAS T, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10869-009-9132-2; DELOITTE, 2015; DONOU-ADONSOU F, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s11294-015-9559-3; DORN S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.emj.2016.02.009; DOWLING M, 1996, DOI 10.1177/105649269652008; DYER J, 2018, DOI 10.1002/smj.2785; EISENHARDT K, 2007, DOI 10.5465/amj.2007.24160888; EISENHARDT K, 1989, DOI 10.2307/258557; ELSAHN Z, 2020, DOI 10.1111/radm.12412; ESTRADA I, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.11.013; FATEHI K, 2019; FONTI F, 2017, DOI 10.1002/smj.2470; FREDRICH V, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.11.038; GARCIA J, 2016; GIOIA D, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1094428112452151; GIVONI M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2006.02.001; GNYAWALI D, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0149206318788945; GNYAWALI D, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.11.014; GNYAWALI D, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2011.01.009; GNYAWALI D, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-627x.2009.00273.x; HAHN C, 2008, DOI ng qualitative re; HOFFMANN W, 2018, DOI 10.1002/smj.2965; JUSTMAN M, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0048-7333(93)00765-l; KAZIBONI L, 2015; KYLANEN M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.emj.2010.10.006; LASCAUX A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2019.05.015; LI B, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.ijproman.2004.04.006; LUO Y, 2008, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8400365; LUO Y, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2006.08.007; MAKHAYA G, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00090-3; MALUNGU C, 2015; MANSELL R, 1990, DOI 10.1016/0048-7333(90)90009-u; MARIANI M, 2007; MHLANGA F, 2017; MILES M B, 2014; MKHOMAZI S, 2011; MOLE N, 2018; MTEGA W, 2009; NDLOVU N, 2018; NELWAMONDO S, 2013; NGOWI A, 2005, DOI 10.1080/09613210500042895; NHUNDU N, 2015; ONYEAJUWA M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.05.004; OVERA R, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.11.015; PALINKAS L, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10488-013-0528-y; PANDIT D, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2017.09.035; PATTON M Q, 2015; RAI R, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0149206313515525; RITALA P, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2011.00741.x; RITALA P, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2009.07.002; RONNIE D, 1998, DOI 10.1080/08853909808523914; RYAN G W, 2003, DOI 10.1177/1525822x02239569; SALDANA J, 2016; SANOU F, 2016, DOI 10.1111/1467-8551.12132; SCHORR S, 2008; SURI H, 2011, DOI 10.3316/qrj1102063; TELEGEOGRAPHY, 2018; TOWERXCHANGE, 2016; TRAI, 2007; VAN DE GROENENDAAL H, 2018; VOLSCHENK J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.05.026; WARSEN R, 2018, DOI 10.1080/14719037.2018.1428415; YIN R, 2018; YOU K, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120055; YOU K, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.01.015",10,2020,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000597124800005,ISI,NORTHUMBRIA UNIV;NEWCASTLE BUSINESS SCH,NORTHUMBRIA UNIV,NA,"ARAKPOGUN EO, 2020, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC CHANG","ARAKPOGUN EO, 2020, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC CHANG",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120263,NA,BUSINESS; REGIONAL & URBAN PLANNING,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NA,WOS

THIS ARTICLE IDENTIFIES AND ANALYZES THE PROPOSALS MADE BY ACADEMIC LITERATURE TO OVERCOME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE EUROPEAN RURAL WORLD FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD 2016-2020. A SCOPING REVIEW HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT ACCORDING TO THE PRISMA METHODOLOGY IN THE TWO DIMENSIONS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: ACCESS AND CONNECTIVITY, AND USE AND EXPLOITATION. ONLINE DATABASES WERE USED TO IDENTIFY SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES FROM WHICH, AFTER SCREENING, 28 KEY DOCUMENTS WERE SELECTED. THE RESULTS UPDATE SALEMINK SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1991 AND 2014 ON DIGITAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN WESTERN COUNTRIES AND IT ALSO INTENDS TO GO BEYOND BY EXTRACTING RECOMMENDATIONS. A VARIETY OF POLITICAL, SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL, TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES HAS BEEN EXPOSED, WITH A COMMON EMPHASIS ON THE EMPOWERMENT OF RURAL POPULATIONS. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE ACTIONABLE EVIDENCE AND PROPOSALS TO FACILITATE DECISION-MAKING IN CURRENT POLICY INFORMATION TO OVERCOME RURAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. FROM THEM, SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COULD HAVE A WIDE AND RAPID IMPACT TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC LINKED TO THE RURAL DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE SYNTHESIZED. THREE LINES OF ACTION IN THE MEDIUM TERM ARE ALSO PROPOSED: THE EVALUATION OF NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PUBLIC POLICIES; THE CONSIDERATION OF DIGITAL INCLUSION AS A POTENTIAL INSTRUMENT TO REDUCE RURAL DEPOPULATION; AND THE TRAINING IN ADVANCED DIGITAL SKILLS TO IMPROVE THE SOCIAL COMMUNICATION PROCESSES, CONSIDERED KEY TO PROMOTE EMPOWERMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP.","UNIV ZARAGOZA, DEPT JOURNALISM & COMMUN, ZARAGOZA 50009, SPAIN.;  UNIV ZARAGOZA, DEPT BUSINESS ADM, ZARAGOZA 50018, SPAIN.","GARCIA-MADURGA, MA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZARAGOZA, DEPT BUSINESS ADM, ZARAGOZA 50018, SPAIN.","QUINTA F, 2018, DOI 10.5209/aguc.62480; BACH M, 2013, DOI 10.12821/ijispm010403; BEREC, 2017; BOSCH-CAPBLANCH X, 2012, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001185; BOWEN R, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.10.031; CHIHA A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2029.101874; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12154; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2018, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2018040101; DADAMO I, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12114738; DE R, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102171; DEWAN S, 2005; DUVIVIER C, 2018, DOI 10.3917/ecop.214.0097; EPSTEIN D, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.548695; EUROPEAN C, 2015; EUROPEAN C, 2020; EUROPEAN C, 2016; EUROPEAN C, 2000; FREEMAN J, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1623901; GERLI P, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.03.005; GILBERT M, 2010, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.499954; GIUDICE F, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12197939; GRANT M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x; HARTLING L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2015.05.036; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HENNING-SMITH C, 2020, DOI 10.1080/08959420.2020.1770036; IEVOLI C, 2019, DOI 10.2478/euco-2019-0027; KUPRIYANOVA M, 2019, DOI 10.7160/aol.2019.110308; LANGLOIS E, 2017; LOPEZ JHEIMER JULIAN S, 2015; MACK E, 2019, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2019.1574526; MATTEUCCI N, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2019.101830; MEIJERE S, 2017; MOHER D, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ijsu.2010.02.007; MORALES N, 2016, DOI 10.14201/fjc201613169189; O'BRIEN K, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s12913-016-1579-z; OLIVER S, 2017; PAVEZ I, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2017.06.001; PEREZ-CALLE B, 2020; PETERS M, 2020, DOI 10.46658/jbirm-20-01; PETERSON J, 2017, DOI 10.1002/2327-6924.12380; PETRI C, 2017, DOI 10.1108/s0065-283020170000043002; PHILIP L, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2018.09.011; PHILIP L, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.12.002; PLUDDEMANN A, 2018, DOI 10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110990; POLYKALAS S E, 2017, DOI 10.1109/ict.2017.7998244; RAISANEN J, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.09.010; RASMUSSEN J, 2017, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0393; SCHNEIR J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.04.002; PEREIRA J, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-31307-8_38; RICHMOND W, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jrme-02-2017-0006; ROBERTS E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.03.001; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROMO N M, 2017, DOI 10.13042/bordon.2017.52401; SALEMINK K, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.013; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SANCHEZ F, 2019, DOI 10.17993/3ctic.2019.81.74-95; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SOSTERO M, 2020; STROVER S, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00008-8; SZELES M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.007; TIRZIU A, 2017; TOWNSEND L, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.09.001; TRICCO A, 2017, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.12859.x; TRICCO A, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s12916-015-0465-6; BOSCH A, 2018; WATT A, 2008, DOI 10.1017/s0266462308080185; WILSON R, 2019, DOI 10.2478/euco-2019-0031; YE L, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12062424; YU L, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0165551511426246; ZHANG M, 2004, DOI 10.1109/mcom.2003.1267107",17,2020,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000601540600001,ISI,UNIV ZARAGOZA;UNIV ZARAGOZA,UNIV ZARAGOZA,NA,"ESTEBAN-NAVARRO MA, 2020, INFORMATICS-BASEL","ESTEBAN-NAVARRO MA, 2020, INFORMATICS-BASEL",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.3390/informatics7040054,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS",18,MDPI,"RESEARCH GROUP ON DIGITAL COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION, GOVERNMENT OF ARAGON-SPAIN, BOA [S29_20R-GICID, 62]; EUROPEAN SOCIAL FUND FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT (ERDF)",WOS

POLICY,ARTICLE,RURAL COMMUNICATIONS; DIGITAL DIVIDE; MOBILE SERVICES; ICT4D; SRO; RMIO,NA,"A LARGE NUMBER OF RURAL COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, UNLIKE URBAN AREAS WHERE THESE SERVICES HAVE RAPIDLY GROWN. THIS CONNECTIVITY GAP IS MAINLY CAUSED BY THE URBAN-ORIENTED BUSINESS MODELS OF TRADITIONAL OPERATORS, WHICH ARE NOT COST-EFFECTIVE IN REGIONS THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY ISOLATION, LOW POPULATION DENSITY, AND SCARCITY OF RESOURCES. THIS PAPER ANALYZES A FEASIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY TO DEPLOY MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (VOICE AND DATA) IN ISOLATED COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WITH LESS THAN 1000 INHABITANTS BY COMBINING APPROPRIATE LOW-COST TECHNOLOGIES AND AN INNOVATIVE BUSINESS MODEL FOSTERED BY RECENT REGULATION. THIS INNOVATIVE MODEL IS BASED ON THE LEGAL FIGURE OF THE SRO (SMALL RURAL OPERATOR), WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY ORIENTED TO REACH SMALL COMMUNITIES IN ISOLATED RURAL AREAS. THE RESULTS ARE BASED ON A REAL DEPLOYMENT IN 6 COMMUNITIES OF THE PERUVIAN AMAZON, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT BY A CONSORTIUM OF UNIVERSITIES, NGOS (NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS), AND CELLULAR OPERATORS. THIS DEPLOYMENT ALLOWED US TO OBTAIN PRACTICAL INFORMATION ON THE COST STRUCTURE OF MOBILE NETWORKS IN ISOLATED AREAS, CHARACTERIZE THE RURAL DEMAND AND THE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE BUSINESS MODEL OF TRADITIONAL OPERATORS COULD BE ADAPTED. THIS INFORMATION PERMITTED US TO PROPOSE, IMPLEMENT AND VALIDATE THE SRO APPROACH. THE PAPER SHOWS THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH AND PROVIDES SOME LESSONS LEARNED. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT THE RECENT PERUVIAN REGULATION OPENED A NICHE MARKET FOR SROS WHO WANT TO OFFER SERVICES IN ISOLATED COMMUNITIES WITH LESS THAN 1000 INHABITANTS.","REY JUAN CARLOS UNIV, DEPT SIGNAL THEORY & COMMUN, MADRID, SPAIN.;  PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA PERU, RURAL TELECOMMUN RES GRP, LIMA, PERU.;  UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA, DEPT SIGNAL THEORY & COMMUN, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","PRIETO-EGIDO, I (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV REY JUAN CARLOS, ETS INGN TELECOMUNICAC, DEPT 3, DESPACHO 201,CAMINO MOLINO 5, MADRID 28943, SPAIN.","BAIG R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2015.07.009; BARELA M C, 2016; BEBEA I, 2011; BHAVNANI A, 2008; CRUZ G, 2018; ERDOGDU F, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.023; HEIMERL K, 2013, DOI 10.1145/2516604.2516616; REIGADAS F, 2008, DOI 10.1109/mwc.2008.4547519; JHA A, 2015; KAMSU-FOGUEM B, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.hlpt.2014.08.008; MARTINEZ-DOMINGUEZ M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2019.101226; MARTINEZ-FERNANDEZ A, 2016, DOI 10.1109/mcom.2016.7509376; OSIPTEL, 2017; RADEMACHER M, 2013; REY-MORENO C, 2015; RUIZ CALDERON R, 2019; SALDANA J, 2017; SIMO-REIGADAS F, 2010, DOI 10.1109/tmc.2010.27; SIMO-REIGADAS J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2015.09.006; STRYJAK J, 2019; SURANA S, 2008; TRENDOV N, 2019; WADE L, 2015",8,2020,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000618447000006,ISI,REY JUAN CARLOS UNIV;PONTIFICIA UNIV CATOLICA PERU;UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA,UNIV REY JUAN CARLOS,NA,"PRIETO-EGIDO I, 2020, TELECOMMUN POLICY","PRIETO-EGIDO I, 2020, TELECOMMUN POLICY",PERU;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102039,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,DEVELOPMENT BANK OF LATIN AMERICA (CAF); SPANISH AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (AECID); EUROPEAN COMMISSION [IST-601102 STP],WOS

THESE CHANGES LEAD TO A GROWING DEMAND FOR NEW SKILLS RELATED TO ICT USE, COMPUTER LITERACY, INTERNET USE, OR TECHNICAL DIGITAL SKILLS. HOWEVER, THE EXTENSIVE LITERATURE ON DIGITAL INEQUALITY PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN COMPUTER SKILLS ALONG THE USUAL DIMENSIONS OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY. DUE TO THE OMNIPRESENCE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN EVERYDAY LIFE, IT IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT TO KNOW THE EXTENT OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT SOCIAL PARTICIPATION DOES NOT DEGENERATE INTO A QUESTION OF SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE. IN THIS PAPER, WE PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN AUSTRIA USING SURVEY DATA FROM THE ""PROGRAMME FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF ADULT COMPETENCIES""(PIAAC) CONDUCTED IN 2011/2012.1 WE SHOW, FOR AUSTRIA, THAT HIGHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO DIGITAL PROBLEM-SOLVING WHILE BEING FEMALE IS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED.

THE CONCEPT OF DIGITAL DIVIDE EMERGED FROM A PERSPECTIVE ON UNEQUAL ACCESS TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND RELATES NOWADAYS PRIMARILY THE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPETENCIES NECESSARY TO HANDLE THIS TECHNOLOGY. TO INVESTIGATE DIGITAL DIVIDE, THE PRESENT PAPER USES THE PIAAC FRAMEWORK OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES WHICH IS CALLED PROBLEM SOLVING IN TECHNOLOGY-RICH ENVIRONMENTS (PS-TRE). IT INTRODUCES THE APPROACH OF INTERSECTIONALITY THAT DESCRIBES PERSONS IMPAIRED BY MULTIPLE INEQUALITIES. THE PAPER ANALYZES THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON PS-TRE FOR THREE SUBSAMPLES OF THE GERMAN STUDY: (1) EMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO USE COMPUTERS AT WORK AND AT HOME, (2) EMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO USE COMPUTERS ONLY AT HOME, AND (3) PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE. IT ANALYZES FURTHERMORE CONTRIBUTIONS TO DIGITAL DIVIDE BY A COMPARISON OF THESE IMPACTS WITH LITERACY AND NUMERACY SCORES. WHILE EMPLOYED PEOPLE WITH COMPUTER USE AT WORK AND HOME ONLY HAD GENERATION AS A FACTOR FOR CONSTITUTING DIGITAL DIVIDE, EMPLOYED PEOPLE WITH COMPUTER USE ONLY AT HOME HAD MIGRATION BACKGROUND AS A FURTHER FACTOR.

EDUC.,ARTICLE,LEARNING GAP; CUMULATIVE DISADVANTAGE; DIGITAL DIVIDE; SCHOOL CLOSURE; AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES; INFORMAL EDUCATION,INSTRUCTIONAL-TIME,"THE LOCKDOWN OF SCHOOLS IN SPAIN TO CONFRONT THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 CAUSED AN ENORMOUS IMPACT AT BOTH SOCIETAL AND EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES HAD TO REACT RAPIDLY TO A NEW TEACHING AND LEARNING SCENARIO WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF PREVIOUS PLANNING OR GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES. IN THIS CONTEXT, SOME SCHOOLS WERE BETTER ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAN OTHERS. LIKEWISE, THE STRUCTURE AND SIZE OF FAMILIES' ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CAPITAL PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF THE SCHOOL LOCKDOWN ON THE LEARNING GAP BETWEEN CHILDREN FROM DIFFERENT SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS IN CATALONIA. BASED ON 35,419 RESPONSES TO AN ONLINE SURVEY ADMINISTERED BETWEEN 26 AND 30 MARCH 2020 TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AGED BETWEEN 3 AND 18, THE AUTHORS' ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY. MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIGHER STANDARDS OF EDUCATION QUALITY IN A CRITICAL CONTEXT, WHILE CHILDREN FROM SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES HAD FEW LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES BOTH IN TERMS OF TIME AND LEARNING EXPERIENCES (SCHOOLWORK AND MAINTENANCE OF AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES). RESULTS DIFFERED BY TYPE OF SCHOOL (PUBLIC/PRIVATE) WHERE STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED, FAMILY ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CAPITAL, AND FAMILY LIVING CONDITIONS. IN THE FINAL PART OF THE ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL IN ENSURING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN FROM LOW SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS, AND THEY DISCUSS SOME POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR FINDINGS.","UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, DEPT SOCIOL, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;  UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","BONAL, X (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA, DEPT SOCIOL, BARCELONA, SPAIN.","ABADZI H, 2009, DOI 10.1093/wbro/lkp008; ALEGRE M, 2012; ALEGRE M, 2016; BELOT M, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9914.2010.00494.x; BLANK G, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0894439316671698; BORSE R, 2011, DOI 10.1093/cid/ciq033; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BRADLEY J, 2016, DOI 10.1002/berj.3232; BURGESS S, 2020; CATTANEO M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/09645292.2017.1315055; CHEN W, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jinf.2011.01.007; CHETTY R, 2020; DAHMANN S, 2015, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2630179; EEF (EDUCATION ENDOWMENT F, 2018; GOLDSTEIN D, 2020; GONZALEZ MOTOS S, 2020; GONZALEZ MOTOS S, 2016; GOODMAN J, 2014, DOI 10.3386/w20221; GOS (GOVERNMENT OF S, 1978; GROMADA A, 2016, DOI 10.1787/5jm409kqqkjh-en; HANUSHEK E, 2015, DOI 10.1111/ecoj.12266; HEPPEN J, 2017, DOI 10.1080/19345747.2016.1168500; HUEBENER M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.labeco.2017.04.007; IQBAL S A, 2020; JAUME D, 2019, DOI 10.1086/703134; KAY J, 2020; KUHFELD M, 2020, DOI 10.26300/cdrv-yw05; KUHFELD M, 2020; LAUER P, 2003; MARCOTTE D, 2008, DOI 10.1162/edfp.2008.3.3.316; MEYER F, 2017, DOI 10.1111/1467-9817.12061; MORA T, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0044118x15626050; OREOPOULOS P, 2006, DOI 10.1086/506484; POTTER D, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0731121416629989; QUINN D, 2016, DOI 10.3102/0013189x16677965; SADIQUE M, 2008, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-8-135; SCHEERENS J, 2014; SHORES K, 2018; VALLESPIN I, 2020; VAN LANCKER W, 2020, DOI 10.1016/s2468-2667(20)30084-0; VON H, 2019; WEIDMANN B, 2020",63,2020,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000569543300001,ISI,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA;UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,NA,"BONAL X, 2020, INT REV EDUC","BONAL X, 2020, INT REV EDUC",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1007/s11159-020-09860-z,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,68,SPRINGERNATURE,NA,WOS

IN THIS PAPER, WE ESTIMATE THE VOLUME AND DYNAMICS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN ACCESS AND USE OF THE INTERNET IN RUSSIA BY KEY SOCIAL GROUPS ACCORDING TO A LONGITUDINAL SURVEY FOR 2008-2018. WE FOUND THAT ALONG WITH THE REDUCING OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ITS GAPS STILL REMAIN. THE GREATEST POLARIZATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCOME, AGE, AND TYPE OF RESIDENCE OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE MOST VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUPS ON ACCESS TO ICTS AND INTERNET USE ARE THE LOW-INCOME, THE ELDERLY, CITIZENS WITH DISABILITIES, AND THOSE LIVING IN RURAL AREAS.

FURTHERMORE, IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT MANY SCHOOLS, ESPECIALLY THOSE LOCATED IN SOCIOECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED AREAS, ARE PARTICULARLY ENGAGED IN SUPPORTING STUDENTS' DIGITAL LITERACY AND INNOVATIVELY DESIGNING LEARNING PROCESSES WITH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT).

THESE SCHOOLS ARE REGARDED AS BEING ORGANIZATIONALLY RESILIENT. THIS CONTRIBUTION FOCUSSES ON THESE ORGANIZATIONALLY RESILIENT SCHOOLS WITH REGARD TO THE DOMAIN OF COMPUTER AND INFORMATION LITERACY. IT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE HOW THESE SCHOOLS CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS A TYPOLOGY ACCORDING TO SELECTED SCHOOL AND/OR TEACHER CHARACTERISTICS. METHODS: AS A FIRST STEP, REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF IEA-ICILS 2018 ARE USED TO IDENTIFY ORGANIZATIONALLY RESILIENT SCHOOLS BY USING STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT MEASURES (PLAUSIBLE VALUES) AND THEIR BACKGROUND INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR FAMILIES' SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP A TYPOLOGY, LATENT PROFILE ANALYSES (LPA) ARE CONDUCTED BY USING INPUT AND PROCESS INDICATORS ON THE SCHOOL LEVEL, WHICH HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE RELEVANT FOR IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH EXISTING EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. RESULTS: ABOUT ONE TWENTIETH OF THE SCHOOLS EXAMINED IN THIS CONTRIBUTION CAN BE REGARDED AS ORGANIZATIONALLY RESILIENT AND CAN BE ALLOCATED ONTO A TYPOLOGY OF THREE SCHOOL TYPES THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENT SCHOOL-LEVEL FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: THE INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON PERMITS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PHENOMENON OF ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE IS ALSO EXISTENT WITH REGARD TO THE CONTENT DOMAIN OF COMPUTER AND INFORMATION LITERACY. HOWEVER, THE PROPORTION OF RESILIENT SCHOOLS IS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE VARIATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES.","PADERBORN UNIV, INST EDUC RES, WARBURGER STR 100, D-33098 PADERBORN, GERMANY.","DROSSEL, K (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), PADERBORN UNIV, INST EDUC RES, WARBURGER STR 100, D-33098 PADERBORN, GERMANY.","AESAERT K, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.021; AINLEY J, 2016; AINLEY J, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-71054-9_4; BIAGI F, 2013, DOI 10.1111/ejed.12016; BOTTIA M, 2016, DOI 10.1086/687274; BUABENG-ANDOH C, 2012, DOI 10.4018/ijicte.2015040101; CARRETERO S, 2017; CELEUX G, 1996, DOI 10.1007/bf01246098; CREEMERS B, 2006, DOI 10.1080/09243450600697242; DE JONG R, 2004, DOI 10.1076/sesi.15.1.3.27490; DEPARTMENT FOR E, 2013; DEXTER S, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-71054-9_32; DROSSEL K, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10639-016-9476-y; DROSSEL K, 2019, DOI 10.25656/01:18325; DROSSEL K, 2017, DOI 10.1186/s40536-017-0053-7; EICKELMANN B, 2019; EICKELMANN B, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-71054-9_84; EICKELMANN B, 2019; EICKELMANN B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1474904117725899; EICKELMANN B, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10639-016-9498-5; EICKELMANN B, 2011; ERCIKAN K, 2018; EUROPEAN C, 2020; FERRARI A, 2012; FRAILLON J, 2019; FRAILLON J, 2014; FRAILLON J, 2015; FRAILLON J, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-71054-9_80; GANZEBOOM H, 1992, DOI 10.1016/0049-089x(92)90017-b; GEISINGER K, 2016, DOI 10.1080/08957347.2016.1209207; GERICK J, 2017, DOI 10.1186/s40536-017-0037-7; GERICK J, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.01.013; GIBSON W, 1959, DOI 10.1007/bf02289845; HATLEVIK I, 2018, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00935; HATLEVIK O, 2015, DOI 10.1111/jcal.12065; HATLEVIK O, 2017, DOI 10.1080/00313831.2016.1172501; JUNG M, 2015; KIRU E W, 2018; LAI K W, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-73315-9_13; LORENZ R, 2015; MEGGIOLARO S, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11218-017-9425-7; MISHRA P, 2017; MUIJS D, 2004, DOI 10.1076/sesi.15.2.149.30433; MUTHEN L K, 2012; OECD, 2010; OLSZEWSKI B, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103849; OTTESTAD G, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-71054-9_92; OTTESTAD G, 2013; PETKO D, 2018, DOI 10.1080/07380569.2018.1428007; PETKO D, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0735633116649373; PLOMP T, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-8928-2; RONFELDT M, 2015, DOI 10.3102/0002831215585562; SAUDELLI M, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1475939x.2014.979865; SCHEERENS J, 1990, DOI 10.5673/sip.50.1.4; SCHEERENS J, 1997; SCHELVIS R, 2014, DOI 10.1080/13540602.2014.937962; SCHWARZ G, 1978, DOI 10.1214/aos/1176344136; SENKBEIL M, 2019; TOMCZYK L, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10639-015-9455-8; TONDEUR J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2007.05.003; TONDEUR J, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s11423-016-9481-2; TONDEUR J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2011.10.009; TORNEY-PURTA J, 2013, DOI 10.2304/rcie.2013.8.3.248; UNESCO INSTITUTE FOR S, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018; VOOGT J, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcal.12029; VOOGT J, 2018; YANG X, 2015",9,2020,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000548649500001,ISI,PADERBORN UNIV,PADERBORN UNIV,NA,"DROSSEL K, 2020, LARGE-SCALE ASSESS EDUC","DROSSEL K, 2020, LARGE-SCALE ASSESS EDUC",GERMANY,10.1186/s40536-020-00087-w,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,9,SPRINGER,BMBF (FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH),WOS

WITH REDUCED OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER IN PERSON COME NEW CHALLENGES TO REMAIN SOCIALLY CONNECTED. THIS ESSAY ADDRESSES HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS CHANGED PEOPLE'S USE OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION METHODS, AND HOW INEQUALITIES IN THE USE OF THESE METHODS MAY ARISE. WE DRAW ON DATA COLLECTED FROM 1,374 AMERICAN ADULTS BETWEEN 4 AND 8 APRIL 2020, ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER LOCKDOWN MEASURES WERE INTRODUCED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE FIRST ADDRESS WHETHER PEOPLE CHANGED THEIR DIGITAL MEDIA USE TO REACH OUT TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY, LOOKING INTO VOICE CALLS, VIDEO CALLS, TEXT MESSAGING, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND ONLINE GAMES. THEN, WE SHOW HOW AGE, GENDER, LIVING ALONE, CONCERNS ABOUT INTERNET ACCESS, AND INTERNET SKILLS RELATE TO CHANGES IN SOCIAL CONTACT DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE DISCUSS HOW THE USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION DURING A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS MAY BE UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG CITIZENS AND MAY CONTINUE TO SHAPE INEQUALITIES EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. SUCH INSIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERING THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON PEOPLE'S SOCIAL WELLBEING.

TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS MULTIDIMENSIONAL GEOGRAPHY, OUR PAPER DEVELOPS A NEW GEODEMOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION FOR THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF GREAT BRITAIN. IN THIS MODEL, WE INTEGRATE A RANGE OF NEW SMALL AREA MEASURES THAT ARE DRAWN FROM MULTIPLE NEW FORMS OF DATA INCLUDING CONSUMER PURCHASING DATA, SURVEY AND OPEN DATA SOURCES. OUR ANALYTICAL APPROACH INNOVATIVELY PROVIDES AN INTEGRATION OF MACHINE LEARNING INTO A SMALL-AREA ESTIMATION TECHNIQUE TO OBTAIN LOWER SUPER OUTPUT AREA/DATA ZONE ESTIMATES OF INTERNET USE, ALONGSIDE A RANGE OF ONLINE ENGAGEMENT AND CONSUMPTION MEASURES. FOLLOWING THE COLLATION OF A RANGE OF INPUT MEASURES, WE IMPLEMENTED A MORE STANDARD GEODEMOGRAPHIC FRAMEWORK THAT UTILISES THE UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING ALGORITHM K-MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAP OF THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY FOR GREAT BRITAIN; CREATING THE INTERNET USER CLASSIFICATION (IUC). OUR OUTPUTS PROVIDE A NEW AND NUANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONTEMPORARY SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN GREAT BRITAIN, WHICH WE EVALUATE BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF PREPARATIONS FOR THE 2021 UK CENSUS OF THE POPULATION, EXPLORING THE GEODEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS OF CENSUS TEST RESPONSE RATES AND THE PREVALENCE TO COMPLETE THE SURVEY ONLINE. OUR INNOVATIVE WORK ILLUSTRATES THE STRENGTH OF A GEODEMOGRAPHIC APPROACH IN MAPPING SPATIAL PATTERNS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY, AND THROUGH THE PRESENTED APPLICATION CONCERNING CENSUS RESPONSE RATES AND CHARACTERISTICS WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THE IUC CAN BE OPERATIONALISED WITHIN SUCH SETTINGS FOR LOCAL INTERVENTION OR BENCHMARKING.","UNIV LIVERPOOL, DEPT GEOG & PLANNING, LIVERPOOL, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LIVERPOOL, PUBL HLTH & POLICY, LIVERPOOL, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LIVERPOOL, DEPT COMP SCI, LIVERPOOL, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.","SINGLETON, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ROXBY BLDG,74 BEDFORD ST S, LIVERPOOL L69 7ZT, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.","ALEXIOU A, 2016, DOI 10.2148/benv.42.3.382; ANDERSON W, 2014, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0100037; BORG K, 2019, DOI 10.1080/10410236.2018.1485077; BORG K, 2018, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2018.1436593; BUCHI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604154; CHANG J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01634372.2014.913754; CHEN T, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2939672.2939785; DALTON C, 2015, DOI 10.1177/2053951715601144; DOLEGA L, 2021, DOI 10.1177/2399808319840666; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GALE C, 2016, DOI 10.5311/josis.2016.12.232; GHOSH M, 1994, DOI 10.1214/ss/1177010647; GONZALES A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1050438; GRUBESIC T, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.04.002; HARRIS R, 2005; HONEYMAN M, 2016; HUNSAKER A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818787348; INKINEN T, 2018, DOI 10.1080/09654313.2018.1448756; KONTOKOSTA C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.03.004; KOWARIK A, 2016, DOI 10.18637/jss.v074.i07; KRIEGLER B, 2010, DOI 10.1214/10-aoas328; LISSITSA S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2016.04.015; LOMAX N, 2016; LONGLEY P, 2005, DOI 10.1191/0309132505ph528pr; LONGLEY P, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0042098009104566; LOVELACE R, 2016; MARLER W, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818765154; MESCH G, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1460458215590863; MOON G, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.06.029; PENG G, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.013; RAHMAN A, 2010; RAO J, 2017, DOI 10.1002/9781118445112.stat03310; SCHONLAU M, 2002, DOI 10.1177/1536867x0200200405; SINGLETON A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.11.013; SINGLETON A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2019.102038; SINGLETON A, 2015, DOI 10.1002/geo2.7; SINGLETON A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/00330124.2013.848764; SINGLETON A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2008.10.006; SPIELMAN S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2015.1052335; SZELES M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.007; THOMAS J, 2017, DOI 10.4225/50/59b762ab75714.; TIMMS D, 1971; TSETSI E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/2050157917708329; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; VICKERS D, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-985x.2007.00466.x; WAMI W, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.healthplace.2019.05.005; WEBBER R, 2018, DOI 10.4135/9781529714685; WHITWORTH A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.06.004; XIANG L, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2018.02.002; YE J, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1645953.1646301; YU R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109695",15,2020,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES & ECOLOGY; GEOGRAPHY; OPERATIONS RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT SCIENCE; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000542079600003,ISI,UNIV LIVERPOOL;UNIV LIVERPOOL;UNIV LIVERPOOL,A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR),NA,"SINGLETON A, 2020, COMPUT ENVIRON URBAN SYST","SINGLETON A, 2020, COMPUT ENVIRON URBAN SYST",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101486,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL; ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES; GEOGRAPHY; OPERATIONS RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT SCIENCE; REGIONAL & URBAN PLANNING",15,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"UK ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL [ES/L011840/1]; EPSRC [EP/M023583/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI; ESRC [ES/L011840/1, ES/L013800/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI",WOS

EDUC.,ARTICLE,SOCIAL WORK; LEARNING; TEACHING METHODS; SURVEYS; HEALTH CARE WORKERS; MOBILE PHONE; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DISTANCE EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY,NA,"BACKGROUND: CONTINUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE IS A KEY ELEMENT IN IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR THE USERS OF SOCIAL CARE SERVICES. AS THE DELIVERY OF SOCIAL CARE SERVICES CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM INNOVATION IN ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE DIGITAL CAPABILITIES OF THE SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE ARE ALIGNED. POLICY MAKERS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT WORKFORCE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKFORCE HAS THE NECESSARY DIGITAL SKILLS TO FULLY BENEFIT FROM SUCH PROVISIONS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE DIGITAL CAPABILITY OF THE SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND AND TO EXPLORE THE WORKFORCE'S APPETITE FOR AND BARRIERS TO USING TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE DIGITAL CAPABILITY OF THE SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE IN NORTHERN IRELAND? (2) WHAT IS THE WORKFORCE'S APPETITE TO PARTICIPATE IN DIGITAL LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT? AND (3) IF THERE ARE BARRIERS TO THE UPTAKE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT, WHAT ARE THESE BARRIERS? METHODS: A SURVEY WAS CREATED AND DISTRIBUTED TO THE NORTHERN IRELAND SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE. THIS SURVEY COLLECTED DATA ON 127 METRICS THAT DESCRIBED DEMOGRAPHICS, BASIC DIGITAL SKILLS, TECHNOLOGY CONFIDENCE AND ACCESS, FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT, EXPERIENCE WITH DIGITAL LEARNING SOLUTIONS, AND PERCEIVED VALUE AND CHALLENGES OF USING TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING. RESULTS: THE SURVEY WAS OPENED FROM DECEMBER 13, 2018, TO JANUARY 18, 2019. A TOTAL OF 775 SURVEY RESPONDENTS COMPLETED THE SURVEY. THE RESULTS INDICATED A WORKFORCE WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF SELF-REPORTED BASIC DIGITAL SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE. FACE-TO-FACE DELIVERY OF LEARNING IS STILL THE MOST COMMON METHOD OF ACCESSING LEARNING, WHICH WAS USED BY 83.7% (649/775) OF THE RESPONDENTS; HOWEVER, THIS IS CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY DIGITAL LEARNING, WHICH WAS USED BY 79.0% (612/775) OF THE RESPONDENTS. THERE WAS A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE AND DIGITAL SKILLS (R(S)=-0.262; P<.001), AND A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY CONFIDENCE AND DIGITAL SKILLS (R(S)=0.482; P<.001). THERE WAS ALSO A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE AND THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF TECHNOLOGY (R(S)=-0.088; P=.02). THE RESULTS INDICATED A PREDOMINANTLY MOTIVATED WORKFORCE IN WHICH A SIZABLE PORTION IS ALREADY ENGAGED IN INFORMAL DIGITAL LEARNING. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT LOWER SELF-REPORTED BASIC DIGITAL SKILLS AND CONFIDENCE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS INTEREST IN ENGAGING WITH E-LEARNING TOOLS AND THAT A PORTION OF THE WORKFORCE WOULD BENEFIT FROM ADDITIONAL BASIC DIGITAL SKILLS TRAINING. CONCLUSIONS: THESE PROMISING RESULTS PROVIDE A POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE POTENTIAL OF DIGITAL LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE CLEAR AREAS OF FOCUS FOR THE FUTURE USE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL CARE WORKFORCE AND CONSIDERATIONS TO MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT WITH SUCH APPROACHES.","UNIV ULSTER, SCH COMP, JORDANSTOWN CAMPUS,ROOM 16E07, NEWTOWNABBEY BT37 0QB, NORTH IRELAND.;  NORTHERN IRELAND SOCIAL CARE COUNCIL, BELFAST, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND.","SYNNOTT, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ULSTER, SCH COMP, JORDANSTOWN CAMPUS,ROOM 16E07, NEWTOWNABBEY BT37 0QB, NORTH IRELAND.","CAMPBELL A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02615479.2015.1130805; DE GAGNE JENNIE C, 2019, DOI 10.2196/13997; HEALTH EDUCATION E, 2017, DOI 10.12968/bjha.2017.11.8.402; KENNEDY S, 2017, DOI 10.12968/bjca.2017.12.9.428; MORRISON C, 2017; NISCC, 2019; SILVERBEAR M, 2019; SURVEYMONKEY, 2019; WILKINSON A, 2019, DOI 10.2196/15297",0,2020,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000848662000002,ISI,UNIV ULSTER;NORTHERN IRELAND SOCIAL CARE COUNCIL,UNIV ULSTER,NA,"SYNNOTT J, 2020, JMIR MED EDUC","SYNNOTT J, 2020, JMIR MED EDUC",IRELAND;IRELAND,10.2196/15936,NA,"EDUCATION, SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES",0,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",INVEST NORTHERN IRELAND,WOS

THESE FINDINGS WILL, IN TURN, HOPEFULLY HELP THE POLICYMAKERS OF ARCHIPELAGOS DEFINE THEIR OWN ULTRA-FAST BROADBAND DEVELOPMENT PLANS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH HAS BEEN USED, BASED ON THE OBSERVATION OF THE HISTORICAL RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE ARCHIPELAGO AND THE WAY BROADBAND WAS DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE TERRITORY. FINDINGS RESULTS SHOW THAT THE BROADBAND HAS DEVELOPED ASYMMETRICALLY IN THE ARCHIPELAGO, WHICH, IN TURN, HAS CAUSED THE ONSET OF A TRIPLE SPATIAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED THAT SOME ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT WAY THAT SUCH PROGRAMMES ARE CREATED AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE WAY THAT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED, THAT COULD BE IMPROVED AND MIGHT HELP PREVENT GEOGRAPHICAL DISCRIMINATION. LASTLY, SEVERAL INSIGHTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE A LARGE AMOUNT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT STUDYING ULTRA-FAST BROADBAND NGA NETWORKS DEPLOYMENT.

MEANWHILE, MANY WESTERN SOCIETIES HAVE AGEING POPULATIONS, WHERE OLDER ADULTS ARE LESS DIGITALLY ACTIVE THAN THE POPULATION AT LARGE. THIS, COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT THE NEWS MEDIA ARE CRUCIAL IN PROVIDING INFORMATION AND FOSTERING ENGAGEMENT AND COHESION, MEANS THAT THE NEWS CONSUMPTION OF OLDER ADULTS DESERVES SCHOLARLY ATTENTION. BASED ON NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE SURVEYS, THIS ARTICLE ANALYSES THE USE OF TRADITIONAL AND DIGITAL NEWS AMONG PEOPLE AGED 66 TO 85 BETWEEN 2014 AND 2018. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE OVERALL READING OF NEWSPAPERS IS DECREASING AMONG PENSIONERS OF ALL AGES, WHEREAS RADIO AND TELEVISION NEWS BOTH HAVE RATHER STABLE AUDIENCE SHARES. DESPITE THE OVERALL DECLINE OF NEWSPAPER READING, THE READING OF DIGITAL NEWSPAPERS IS BECOMING MORE COMMON, AND DIGITAL NEWSPAPERS SEEM, TO SOME EXTENT, TO HAVE REPLACED PRINTED NEWSPAPERS. CONCERNING FACTORS EXPLAINING DIGITAL NEWS CONSUMPTION AMONG THE 65+ GROUP, GENERAL INTERNET HABITS, SEX, AND POLITICAL INTEREST ARE SHOWN TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT.","UNIV GOTHENBURG, DEPT JOURNALISM MEDIA & COMMUN, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.","BERGSTROM, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GOTHENBURG, DEPT JOURNALISM MEDIA & COMMUN, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.","AALBERG T, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1940161213485990; BECKER L, 1989; BERGSTROM A, 2017, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0398; BERGSTROM A, 2015; BERGSTROM A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0267323119830048; CAREY J, 2010, DOI 10.3998/nmw.8859947.0001.001; CHAN J, 2005, DOI 10.1177/1461444805052281; CHYI H, 2010, DOI 10.1177/107769901008700104; DALTON R, 2017, DOI 10.1093/oso/9780198733607.001.0001; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DE WAAL E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809341859; DIMMICK J, 2004, DOI 10.1207/s15327736me1701_2; DIMMICK J, 2003; DUTTA-BERGMAN M, 2004, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4801_3; EDGERLY S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2014.998220; ELVESTAD E, 2009, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0154; ELVESTAD E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0267323108096993; FLAVIAN C, 2009, DOI 10.2501/s1470785309200864; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; HARGITTAI E, 2017, DOI 10.22230/cjc2017v42n2a3176; KATZ E, 1974; KONIG R, 1998, DOI 10.1515/comm.1998.23.4.505; KSIAZEK T, 2010, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2010.519808; LASSWELL H, 1948; LAUF E, 2001, DOI 10.1177/0267323101016002005; MCQUAIL D, 2010; MEE-EUN K, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0736-5853(99)00019-2; MITCHELL A, 2015; NEWMAN N, 2019; NYGREN G, 2018, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0419; OGAN C, 2009, DOI 10.4135/9781412972048; OSTERTAG S, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0163443710367694; PAPATHANASSOPOULOS S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/17512786.2012.761324; PETERS C, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1461670x.2014.889944; PRIOR M, 2007; QUAN-HAASE A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0002764218777572; QUAN-HAASE A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1140217; ROGERS E, 2010; ROSENGREN K E, 1974; ROSENSTEIN A, 1997, DOI 10.1080/08838159709364411; SCHNAUBER-STOCKMANN A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/03637751.2020.1758336; SCHREURS K, 2017, DOI 10.22230/cjc2017v42n2a3130; SHEARER E, 2016; SKOGERBO E, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0267323111413112; STROMBACK J, 2013, DOI 10.1093/ijpor/eds018; TANEJA H, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817707348; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VENKATESH V, 2012; WADBRING I, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1461670x.2015.1042988; WEIBULL L, 1985; WEISSENBILDER, 2019; YUAN E, 2011, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.549235",2,2020,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000605275100001,ISI,UNIV GOTHENBURG,UNIV GOTHENBURG,NA,"BERGSTROM A, 2020, NORD REV","BERGSTROM A, 2020, NORD REV",SWEDEN,10.2478/nor-2020-0021,NA,COMMUNICATION,2,SCIENDO,NA,WOS

HOWEVER, IT IS AN ISSUE OF GREAT INTEREST DUE TO THE EFFECTS THAT COMMUNICATIVE DISCONNECTION CAUSES IN RURAL AREAS AFFECTED BY DEPOPULATION AND AGEING. BASED ON THE TOTAL CENSUS (582) OF MUNICIPALITIES OF THE VALENCIAN COMMUNITY (SPAIN), THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF AN EMPIRICAL STUDY ON THE DEVELOPMENT (BETWEEN 2005 AND 2017) OF THE LOCAL E- GOVERNMENT IN SMALL MUNICIPALITIES OF THIS REGION. USING THE DIFFERENT STAGES AND DIMENSIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE STUDIES ON THE EVOLUTION OF E-GOVERNMENT (INFORMATION, TRANSACTION, TRANSPARENCY AND PARTICIPATION), WE CAN OBSERVE HOW THE LATEST TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS (ESPECIALLY THE INCORPORATION OF DIGITAL SOCIAL NETWORKS) HAVE LED TO A DECREASE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG MUNICIPALITIES ACCORDING TO POPULATION SIZE, AND GREATER AUTONOMY OF THE SMALLEST MUNICIPALITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC POLITICAL COMMUNICATION WITH RESPECT TO HIGHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT (PROVINCIAL, REGIONAL AND STATE). MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE EXPLORES (THROUGH A SAMPLE OF EXTREME CASES, 40) A NEVER BEFORE ADDRESSED DIMENSION IN E-GOVERNMENT STUDIES THAT REFERS TO THE IDENTITY AND SYMBOLIC ASPECTS THAT DIGITAL SOCIAL NETWORKS PROVIDE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY IN SMALL MUNICIPALITIES, IT IS OBSERVED THAT THIS IDENTITY DIMENSION IS DEVELOPED TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN THOSE RELATED TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT OR TO CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.","UNIV ALICANTE, ALICANTE, SPAIN.","OLTRA, LC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ALICANTE, ALICANTE, SPAIN.","BALLESTER A, 2018; BEARFIELD D, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0275074015627694; BELLSTROM P, 2016, DOI 10.1108/tg-12-2015-0061; BONSON E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0095399714544945; BONSON E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2014.11.001; BONSON E, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2011.10.001; CANO C, 2018; CEGARRA-NAVARRO J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2012.02.008; CEVALSI, 2008; CHAPMAN S, 2017; CONSELL DE T, 2018; CRIADO JUAN I, 2004, DOI 10.3989/ris.2004.i39.249; DEPAULA N, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.10.003; ESCRIBANO J, 2015; FATHALLAH A, 2014, DOI 10.5121/ijsea.2014.5306; FORONDA C, 2016; GAO X, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.09.005; GASCO-HERNANDEZ M, 2014; GENERALITAT V, 2018; GONZALEZ R, 2007, DOI 10.1108/02635570710758752; GRAHAM M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.pubrev.2015.02.001; HARO-DE-ROSARIO A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816645652; CRIADO J, 2015, DOI 10.7238/idp.v0i20.2581; CRIADO J, 2013, DOI 10.4018/978-1-4666-4173-0.ch014; CRIADO J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.10.003; KNEUER M, 2016, DOI 10.1111/1758-5899.12372; LAPPAS G, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s12626-018-0017-6; LAYNE K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00066-1; LEE G, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2012.06.001; MARCHIO G, 2015; AVIDAD M, 2011; MAUDOS VILLARROYA J, 2017; MERGEL I, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2015.09.002; MUNOZ CANAVATE A, 2018; NACIONES U, 2014; NAVARRO F, 2014, DOI 10.4067/s0250-71612014000300010; NORRIS D, 2013, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02647.x; NORRIS P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0894439302238974; NOVECK B, 2009, DOI 10.7146/mediekultur.v28i52.5731; PAIVA G D, 2014, DOI 10.1109/cisti. 2014.6877041; PEGV, 2018; ROGERS E, 1995; ROSENBERRY J, 2017, DOI 10.4324/9780203730096; ROYO S, 2008; SEPAM, 2018; SIMELIO SOLA N, 2014, DOI 10.5209/rev_hics.2014.v19.45043; STIEGLITZ S, 2012, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2012.476; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; VAN DER MEER T, 2014, DOI 10.5325/jinfopoli.4.2014.0489; WELP Y, 2004, DOI 10.3989/ris.2004.i37.237; YOUNUS A, 2011, DOI 10.1109/asonam.2011.85; ZAHRAN DALAL I, 2015",0,2020,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000592717800002,ISI,UNIV ALICANTE,UNIV ALICANTE,NA,"OLTRA LC, 2020, AGER","OLTRA LC, 2020, AGER",SPAIN,10.4422/ager.2020.02,NA,SOCIOLOGY,0,PRENSAS UNIV ZARAGOZA,NA,WOS

WHAT HAS ALSO BECOME CLEAR IS THAT THE OLDER ADULT CONSUMER GROUP AND THE FACTORS AFFECTING THIS AGE GROUP HAVE BEEN STUDIED RELATIVELY LESS IN THE LITERATURE. IN THIS PAPER, WE AIM TO INVESTIGATE THE ADOPTION, USAGE, AND DIFFUSION OF SMARTPHONES WITHIN THE UK OLDER ADULTS SO AS TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS ENCOURAGING OR INHIBITING SMARTPHONE USAGE AND SERVICE PROVISION WITHIN THIS AGE GROUP. TO THIS END, WE PROPOSE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK (MODEL OF SMARTPHONE ACCEPTANCE) BASED ON A SET OF WELL-KNOWN THEORIES OF ADOPTION AND DIFFUSION. WE COLLECTED DATA FROM 984 PARTICIPANTS LIVING IN NORTH LONDON AND APPLIED THE PARTIAL LEAST SQUARE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (PLS-SEM) TECHNIQUE TO ANALYSE THE DATA. OUR RESEARCH CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS REDUCING SOME OF THE EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN UK OLDER ADULTS. MOREOVER, BUSINESSES CAN BENEFIT FROM OUR RESEARCH BY UNDERSTANDING THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE ADOPTION OF SMARTPHONES AMONG THE UK OLDER POPULATION AND TO ADAPT THEIR POLICIES ACCORDINGLY.","UNIV HERTFORDSHIRE, HERTFORDSHIRE BUSINESS SCH, HATFIELD AL10 9EU, HERTS, ENGLAND.","CHOUDRIE, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV HERTFORDSHIRE, HERTFORDSHIRE BUSINESS SCH, HATFIELD AL10 9EU, HERTS, ENGLAND.","AJZEN I, 1980;

THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE HIGHLY EDUCATED ARE MORE LIKELY TO OBTAIN POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN ALL FIELDS OF SOCIETY THAN THE LESS EDUCATED, BUT THAT THEY STRIVE TO DIMINISH THE INFLUENCE OF INTERNET USE ON THEIR PERSONAL LIVES BY DISCONNECTING FROM THE INTERNET WHENEVER POSSIBLE.","UNIV TWENTE, ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","SCHEERDER, AJ (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TWENTE, ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","BAELDEN, 2017, DOI 10.14658/pupj-ijse-2017-1-2; BLANK G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BUCHI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604154; CENTRALOF S, 2017; COCKERHAM W, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6193-3_7; COMPAINE B, 2001; DE GREGORIO J, 2002; DIMAGGIO P, 2012, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102545; EIKEMO T, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9566.2007.01073.x; EYNON R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2014.1002845; FERRO E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007; GROOT W, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s11205-006-9035-9; HADDON L, 2000, DOI 10.1177/1461444800002004001; HARGITTAI E, 2001; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1203454; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HUISMAN C, 2018; IGNATOW G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1301519; JENKINS H, 2008; KNESEBECK O, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.03.043; LAHELMA E, 2001; LUSARDI A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.jmoneco.2006.12.001; MICHELI M, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010003; MIHELJ S, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818822816; NETER E, 2012, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1619; PENARD T, 2010, DOI 10.2753/jei0021-3624440301; PUNIE Y, 2005; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROSS C, 1995, DOI 10.2307/2096319; SCHEERDER A J, 2019; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHEERDER A, 2019, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2019.1649774; SHAVERS V, 2007; SILVERSTONE R, 1996, DOI 10.1080/00213624.1997.11505978; SKAGERLUND K, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2018.03.004; STICHELE A, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2005.09.002; SYLVESTER D, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0894439309335148; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817715282; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DIJK J, 2019; VAN EIJCK K, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2004.09.001; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; WITTE J, 2010; JIMENEZ J, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jbef.2019.01.004; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",7,2020,LITERATURE; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000541042000005,ISI,UNIV TWENTE,UNIV TWENTE,NA,"SCHEERDER AJ, 2020, POETICS","SCHEERDER AJ, 2020, POETICS",NETHERLANDS,10.1016/j.poetic.2019.101426,NA,LITERATURE; SOCIOLOGY,7,ELSEVIER,NA,WOS

POLICY,ARTICLE,MOBILE BROADBAND USE; DEVELOPING ECONOMY; FINANCIAL INCLUSION; DIGITAL GAP,USAGE; ADOPTION; ACCESS; PHONES; IMPACT,"BROADBAND IS SEEN AS A VECTOR OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT. IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD, MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES ARE WIDELY ADOPTED AND MOBILE BROADBAND IS PROGRESSIVELY ROLLED-OUT WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS ON ITS IMPACT ON THE COUNTRIES' DEVELOPMENT. WE HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE DETERMINANTS OF MOBILE BROADBAND USE ARE IN FOUR SUB-SAHARAN COUNTRIES. USING MICRO-LEVEL DATA COMING FROM HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS OVER 5 YEARS, FROM 2013 TO 2017, WE SHOW THAT SIM CARD OWNERSHIP AND BEING PART OF AN ONLINE SOCIAL COMMUNITY HAS A STRONG POSITIVE IMPACT ON MOBILE BROADBAND USE. WE ALSO HIGHLIGHT A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DIGITAL INCLUSION AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION AS MOBILE MONEY USERS AND BANK ACCOUNT USERS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE INCLINED TO USE MOBILE BROADBAND.

FOR INSTANCE, AMONG THE NON-MOBILE OWNERS IN NIGERIA, THE UNEMPLOYED ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO USE MOBILE BROADBAND, MOST PROBABLY FOR JOB SEARCH PRACTICES, WHILE IT IS RATHER USED BY STUDENTS FOR INFORMATION GATHERING IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

THE LITERATURE OF INFORMATION POVERTY IS REVIEWED TRACKING ITS ORIGINS IN LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE AND THE VARIOUS APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO TACKLING INFORMATION POVERTY, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES SUCH AS THE GLOBAL LIBRARIES INITIATIVE, WORKING RESPONSE TO THE UN'S SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS, THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO HEALTH INFORMATION AND SO ON. THE PAPER SETS OUT THEMES THAT EMERGED IN A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE ACADEMICS IN 2017. DISCUSSION CENTRED ON: DEFINITIONS OF INFORMATION POVERTY WHICH REFLECT THE WIDE VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE INFORMATION POOR; LITERACY AND INFORMATION LITERACY; THE WAYS IN WHICH INFORMATION CAN REDUCE POVERTY AND DISADVANTAGE; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE INITIATIVES TO TACKLE INFORMATION POVERTY; AND INFORMATION POVERTY IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. THE GROUP AGREED THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR PIECE OF WORK TO BE DONE IN REFRAMING THE LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE DISCIPLINE IN TERMS OF INFORMATION POVERTY. FOUR KEY DIMENSIONS OF INFORMATION POVERTY FOR COLLABORATIVE FUTURE RESEARCH ARE: (1) INFORMATION AS AN AGENT TO ERADICATE POVERTY; (2) THE CAUSAL FACTORS RESULTING IN INFORMATION POVERTY; (3) CREATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES TO COMBAT INFORMATION POVERTY; AND (4) BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF AREAS OF EXTREME DISADVANTAGE AND ASPECTS OF INFORMATION NEED. A LIST OF THE KEY CAUSAL FACTORS IN CREATING INFORMATION POVERTY WHICH CAME OUT OF THE DISCUSSION IS PRESENTED.

REV.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL LITERACY; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITIZATION; DIGITAL INCLUSION; DIGITAL INEQUALITIES,DIVIDE SHIFTS,"PURPOSE THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY PROPOSING AN ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITIES IN RUSSIA THAT FOCUSES ON TWO ASPECTS HITHERTO UNDER EXPLORED: THE INTERREGIONALITY (BY COMPARING AND CONTRASTING EIGHT FEDERAL DISTRICTS) AND THE MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF DIGITAL INEQUALITIES (BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE THREE LEVELS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE). THEREFORE, THE AIM IS TO ADDRESS THE PHENOMENON OF DIGITAL DIVIDE IN RUSSIA BY DISCUSSING THE THREE LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE (ACCESS / SKILLS / BENEFITS) IN A COMPARATIVE AND INTERREGIONAL PERSPECTIVE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER USES SECONDARY DATA FOR ITS ANALYSIS, INCLUDING BOTH NATIONAL (E.G. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DAILY INTERNET USERS IN RUSSIA) AND MORE REGIONALIZED DATA (RELATED TO PARTICULAR FEDERAL DISTRICTS OF RUSSIA). THE CHOICE OF DATA SOURCES WAS DETERMINED BY AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A DETAILED AND MULTIFACETED COVERAGE OF ALL THREE LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN RUSSIA, WHICH IS NOT LIMITED TO THE ACCESS PROBLEM ONLY. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE ARE USING AND RE-ELABORATING VARIOUS REPORTS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET AND ICTS IN RUSSIA PREPARED BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO COVER THE FIRST LEVEL OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. TO SHED LIGHT UPON THE SECOND AND THIRD LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, WE DISCUSS DIGITAL LITERACY REPORT (2018), THE REPORT ON INTERNET OPENNESS INDEX OF RUSSIAN REGIONS (2017) AND THE REPORT ON THE DIGITAL LIFE INDEX OF THE RUSSIAN REGIONS (2016). FINALLY, IN THE ATTEMPT TO MAP OUT THE KEY DIRECTIONS OF THE STATE POLICY AIMED AT DECREASING DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN RUSSIA, ON BOTH FEDERAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS, WE ANALYZE THE MOST IMPORTANT REGIONAL AND NATIONAL POLICY MEASURES TO FOSTER DIGITALIZATION SUCH AS THE DIGITAL RUSSIA PROGRAM, THE DIGITAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROGRAM OF ELIMINATING DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN RUSSIA. FINDINGS WE CONSIDER THIS STUDY TO BE BOTH A FIRST EXPLORATION AND A BASELINE OF THE THREE LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDES IN RUSSIA. THE PAPER SHOWS HOW THE LEVEL OF SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICTS, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OBJECTIVE FACTORS (DISTANCE/ISOLATION, URBANIZATION LEVEL, AVAILABILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND COSTS FOR BUILDING NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, ETC.) HAVE IMPACT UPON DIGITALIZATION OF THE REGIONS. AS A RESULT, SEVERAL FEDERAL DISTRICTS OF RUSSIA (CENTRAL, NORTHWESTERN, AND, IN A NUMBER OF CASES, URAL AND VOLGA FEDERAL DISTRICTS) MORE OFTEN THAN OTHERS TAKE LEADING POSITIONS IN RANKINGS, IN TERMS OF DEGREE OF INTERNET PENETRATION, AUDIENCE NUMBERS, USE OF E-SERVICES, ETC. THIS CORRELATION, HOWEVER, IS NOT UNIVERSAL AS WE WILL SHOW, AND SOME REGIONS LACKING BEHIND IN TERMS OF ACCESS CAN BE BOOMING IN TERMS OF DIGITAL LITERACY OR OTHER FACTORS, LIKE IT HAPPENED WITH THE FAR EASTERN FEDERAL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE. ALL IN ALL, OUR RESEARCH SHOWED THAT DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN RUSSIA IS STILL ON PLACE AND WILL REQUIRE MORE TIME FOR COMPLETE ELIMINATION, EVEN THOUGH CURRENT STATE AND PUBLIC INITIATIVES ARE BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER WILL BRING TO LIGHT MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS INTO THE THREE LEVELS OF DIGITAL DIVIDES IN RUSSIA. BASED ON A MULTILEVEL (THREE LEVELS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE) AND MULTI-SECTIONAL APPROACH (THE INTERPLAY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INEQUALITIES), THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTED TO OVERALL BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIGITAL INEQUALITIES PHENOMENON IN RUSSIA.

POLICY,ARTICLE,TECHNO-ECONOMICS; BROADBAND DIGITAL DIVIDE; SATELLITE; 4G,ACCESS; ADOPTION,"BRIDGING THE BROADBAND DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS IN EUROPE IS ONE OF THE MAIN TARGETS OF THE DIGITAL AGENDA FOR EUROPE. THOUGH MANY TECHNOLOGICAL OPTIONS ARE PROPOSED IN LITERATURE, SATELLITE COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION FOR THE MOST RURAL AREAS, DUE TO ITS GLOBAL COVERAGE. HOWEVER, DEPLOYING AN END-TO-END SATELLITE SOLUTION MIGHT, IN SOME CASES, NOT BE COST-EFFECTIVE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO GIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATING SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS INTO 4G NETWORKS IN ORDER TO CONNECT THE MOST RURAL AREAS (ALSO REFERRED TO AS WHITE AREAS) IN EUROPE. TO THIS END, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A CONVERGED SOLUTION THAT COMBINES SATELLITE COMMUNICATION AS A BACKHAUL NETWORK WITH 4G AS A FRONTHAUL NETWORK TO BRING ENHANCED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY TO EUROPEAN RURAL AREAS, ALONG WITH A TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODEL TO ANALYSE THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THIS INTEGRATION. THE MODEL IS BASED ON A TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP (TCO) MODEL FOR 5 YEARS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES, AND AIMS TO CALCULATE THE TCO AS WELL AS THE AVERAGE COST PER USER (ACPU) FOR THE STUDIED SCENARIOS. WE EVALUATE THE SUGGESTED MODEL BY SIMULATING A HYPOTHETICAL USE CASE FOR TWO SCENARIOS. THE FIRST SCENARIO IS BASED ON A RADIO ACCESS NETWORK CONNECTING TO THE 4G CORE NETWORK VIA A SATELLITE LINK. RESULTS FOR THIS SCENARIO SHOW HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THESE COSTS, WE PROPOSE A SECOND SCENARIO, CONSISTING OF CACHING THE POPULAR CONTENT ON THE EDGE TO REDUCE THE TRAFFIC CARRIED OVER THE SATELLITE LINK. THIS SCENARIO DEMONSTRATES A SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL COST DECREASE (MORE THAN 60%), WHICH ALSO MEANS A SIGNIFICANT ACPU DECREASE. WE EVALUATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS BY SIMULATING FOR A RANGE OF POPULATION DENSITIES, HEREBY ALSO PROVIDING AN INDICATION OF THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF OUR PROPOSED SOLUTION ACROSS A WIDER RANGE OF AREAS.","UNIV GHENT, IMEC, GHENT, BELGIUM.","CHIHA, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GHENT, IMEC, GHENT, BELGIUM.","ABDELSALAM A, 2019, DOI 10.1002/sat.1242; ABDELSALAM A, 2017, DOI 10.1109/tsp.2017.8075932; ABRARDI L, 2019; BATS, 2016; BOHLIN E, 2010; BORST S, 2010, DOI 10.1109/infcom.2010.5461964; BOURAS C, 2016, DOI 10.1109/icumt.2016.7765232; CARARE O, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2014.12.001; CASIER K, 2010; CHA M, 2009, DOI 10.1109/tnet.2008.2011358; CHAO HU Y, 2015; CIK V, 2016, DOI 10.17559/tv-20150508131935; CISCO, 2019; CISCO, 2017; DALELA P K, 2014, DOI 10.1109/ants.2014.7057244; DAVIES R, 2016; DEAN SEGEL J, 2009; DURAIRAJAN R, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3089262.3089265; ETSI, 2002; EUROPEAN C, 2016; EUROPEAN C, 2018; EUROPEAN C, 2016; EUROPEAN C, 2015; EUROPEAN C, 2011; EUROPEAN C, 2017; EUROPEAN C, 2013; FEIJOO C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.001; FRIAS Z, 2015; GILAT, 2015; GLASS V, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s11149-010-9119-y; GOMEZ B, 2016; HAN B, 2017, DOI 10.1109/iscc.2017.8024590; INVESTOPEDIA, 2018; IOANNOU P, 2018, DOI 10.11604/pamj.2018.30.64.15292; LAROSE R, 2012; LEMSTRA W, 2016; LIOLIS K, 2019, DOI 10.1002/sat.1245; LIU S, 2013, DOI 10.1109/cc.2013.6650319; LIU Y, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2018.07.001; LO K, 2012; MOGHADDAM B, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.02.005; PICOT A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.08.002; POINT T, 2015; POINT T, 2013; POLYKALAS S E, 2017, DOI 10.1109/ict.2017.7998244; PRESTON P, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.003; SCHNEIR J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.04.002; ROSSINI G, 2012, DOI 10.1109/camad.2012.6335307; SAT5G, 2017; TOWNSEND L, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0269094213496974; VAN DER WEE M, 2014, DOI 10.1364/jocn.6.000238; VSAT, 2018; WANG S, 2017, DOI 10.1109/access.2017.2685434; WANG X, 2014, DOI 10.1109/mcom.2014.6736753; XAVIER P, 2003, DOI 10.1108/14636690310473854; ZANGAR N, 2019, DOI 10.1002/sat.1259; ZANGAR N, 2009, DOI 10.1109/pimrc.2009.5450081",8,2020,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000531084800003,ISI,UNIV GHENT,UNIV GHENT,NA,"CHIHA A, 2020, TELECOMMUN POLICY","CHIHA A, 2020, TELECOMMUN POLICY",BELGIUM,10.1016/j.telpol.2029.101874,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,8,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,EUROPEAN UNION [761413]; COST-ACTION [CA15127],WOS

THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS PHENOMENON IS NOT SO MUCH CONNECTED WITH THE PROBLEM OF INTERNET ACCESS, BUT RATHER WITH THE ABILITY OF USERS TO EMPLOY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. DIGITAL INEQUALITY CREATES NEW ""SOCIAL ELEVATORS"" - THE LEVEL OF IT SKILLS BECOMES THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENTIATING FACTOR WHICH SETS A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR SOCIALIZATION SYSTEM. A WAY TO OVERCOME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICY. DIGITAL INCLUSION IS A TYPE OF SOCIAL INCLUSION IN A DIGITAL SOCIETY, AIMED AT OVERCOMING INEQUALITY, DIGITAL ISOLATION OF CITIZENS. IT FOCUSES ON THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF IT BY GROUPS OR INDIVIDUALS. ULTIMATELY, THE DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICY DOES NOT FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE OR SKILLS, BUT ON ENSURING THE EMERGENCE OF ""VISIBLE"" SOCIAL RESULTS OF ONLINE INTERACTION AMONG CITIZENS (INCREMENT OF ECONOMIC, CULTURAL AND OTHER FORMS OF CAPITAL) DUE TO THE USE OF WEB RESOURCES. BASED ON COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS, THE MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND RUSSIA ARE SHOWN, THE MAIN TYPES OF DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICIES AND THE AGENCIES FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION ARE IDENTIFIED. THE PRIORITIES OF DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICY AND THE STRUCTURE OF ITS MANAGEMENT DEPEND ON SOCIO-POLITICAL REALITIES IN EACH PARTICULAR COUNTRY. OVERCOMING REGIONAL AND GENERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A PRIORITY FOR RUSSIA. THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL INCLUSION STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE DIGITAL BENEFITS TO ALL CITIZENS, REGARDLESS OF GENDER, AGE, EDUCATION, INCOME, GEOGRAPHY. MASTERING DIGITAL SKILLS IS SHOWN AS A FUNDAMENTAL INDICATOR OF DIGITAL INCLUSION IN THE MODERN SENSE. THE KEY AGENCIES OF DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICY ARE NATION-STATE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM, HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF INTERSECTORAL INTERACTION, NGOS, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, LIBRARIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL SKILLS AMONG VARIOUS POPULATION GROUPS IS SIGNIFICANT.

THE ICT-ENHANCED TEACHER STANDARDS FOR AFRICA (ICTETSA) FRAMEWORK COMPRISING DIGITAL ATTITUDE, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND APPLICATION COMPONENTS WAS USED FOR MEASURING THE PERCEIVED TEACHER DIGITAL LITERACY, WHILE, THE EUROPEAN UNION'S RUBRICS FOR MEASURING ICT FREQUENCY IN SCHOOLS WAS ADOPTED FOR ESTIMATING THE EXTENT OF TEACHERS' DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY USAGE/ACTIVITIES. THE STUDY COVERED SIX DISTRICTS IN GHANA WITH 233 TEACHERS (N = 233) SAMPLED FROM 45 SCHOOLS. BASED PERCEPTIONS OF THE TEACHER DIGITAL LITERACY TWO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT DIGITAL DIVIDE CLUSTERS WERE FOUND AMONG SCHOOLS THAT DIVERGED BASED ON THE TEACHERS' DIGITAL APPLICATION COMPONENT OF TEACHER DIGITAL LITERACY. WHILE, MOST SCHOOLS TEACHERS CLAIMED AN ABOVE AVERAGE LEVEL OF TEACHER DIGITAL LITERACY; HOWEVER, MORE THAN 50% OF THE SCHOOLS ARE DIGITALLY PROACTIVE.

WE SYNTHESISED EXISTING THEORIES AND FRAMEWORKS TO DEVELOP AND THEN EMPIRICALLY VALIDATE A THEORETICAL MODEL TO PREDICT UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' USE OF ONLINE LEARNING RESOURCES (OLRS) AT THE CROSSROADS OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEARNING. BECAUSE ACCESS TO DIGITAL CONTENT MAY BE A BIGGER ISSUE FOR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS (SEN), WE ALSO EXAMINED OLR USE AMONG THIS GROUP. FIFTY-SIX STUDENTS WITH SEN AND 1642 MAINSTREAM STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY. OUR MAIN CONCLUSIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS. IN THE WHOLE SAMPLE, PERSONAL SOCIO-COGNITIVE FACTORS (BELIEFS, SELF-EFFICACY) ARE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF OLR USE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MOTIVATIONAL AND SKILLS-RELATED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAN DO EITHER DIFFERENCES RELATED TO UNPLEASANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (EG, INACCESSIBILITY, HIGH PRICES, ETC.)

THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SELECTED EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ACCORDING TO THE OVERALL USAGE OF BIG DATA IN THEIR ENTERPRISES. MOREOVER, THE ENTERPRISES THAT USE INTERNAL EXPERTS ALSO USED DIVERSE BIG DATA SOURCES. SINCE THE USAGE OF DIVERSE BIG DATA SOURCES ALLOWS ENTERPRISES TO GATHER MORE RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITORS, THIS INDICATES THAT ENTERPRISES WITH STRONGER INTERNAL BIG DATA EXPERTISE ALSO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BUILDING STRONG COMPETITIVENESS BASED ON BIG DATA UTILIZATION.

HOWEVER, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON HOW PARTY PREFERENCE IS RELATED TO POLITICALLY ACTIVE SOCIAL MEDIA USE. WE BEGIN WITH A CONSIDERATION OF HOW POLITICAL PARTICIPATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS EVOLVED BETWEEN VARIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS IN ADVANCED INFORMATION SOCIETIES AND ESPECIALLY IN FINLAND. IN OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS WE EXAMINE THE GENERAL USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS WELL AS ITS USE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES WITH THE AID OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATASET, COLLECTED IN 2017-2018 FROM 3724 FINNISH CITIZENS. WE ARGUE THAT THERE ARE NOTABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PARTIES WHEN EXAMINING THEIR SUPPORTERS' SOCIAL MEDIA USE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. THE DIFFERENCES ARE RELATED TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDES AND POLITICAL EXTREMES. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THE IDEA THAT NEW POLITICAL MOVEMENTS MADE UP OF YOUNGER AND MORE EDUCATED SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BY LEVERAGING SOCIAL MEDIA. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE IDEOLOGICAL GAP BETWEEN PARTY SUPPORTERS IS GREATER IN SOCIAL MEDIA ESPECIALLY WHEN EXAMINING NEW KINDS OF POLITICS BASED ON CULTURAL QUESTIONS, IDENTITY ISSUES, AND POST-MATERIALIST VALUES.","UNIV TURKU, DEPT SOCIAL RES, ECON SOCIOL, ASSISTENTINKATU 7, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND.;  AALTO UNIV, DESIGN FACTORY, BETONIMIEHENKUJA 5 C, ESPOO 02150, FINLAND.","KOIRANEN, I (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TURKU, DEPT SOCIAL RES, ECON SOCIOL, ASSISTENTINKATU 7, SF-20500 TURKU, FINLAND.","ARTER D, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01402382.2015.1058468; BEKKERS R, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9221.2005.00425.x; BENNETT W, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0002716212451428; BENNETT W, 2012, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.670661; BERNAUER J, 2012, DOI 10.1080/00344893.2012.653238; BIMBER B, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0894439314526559; BOULIANNE S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1008542; BOUTYLINE A, 2017, DOI 10.1111/pops.12337; BUTLER DANIEL M, 2014; COLLEONI E, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12084; DE ZUNIGA H, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01574.x; DI GENNARO C, 2006, DOI 10.1093/pa/gsl004; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; ENLI G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.782330; EVERETT J, 2013, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0082131; GILBERT E, 2009, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2009.91; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HATAKKA N, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816660728; HOLT K, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323112465369; HONG S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2016.04.007; HOOGHE L, 2002, DOI 10.1177/001041402236310; INGLEHART R, 1996; INGLEHART R, 2018; INGRAMS A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/19331681.2016.1261264; JACCARD J, 2003; JENKINS H, 2006; JUNGAR A, 2014, DOI 10.1111/1467-9477.12024; JUNGHERR A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/19331681.2015.1132401; KARVONEN L, 2014; KEIPI T, 2017; KESTILA-KEKKONEN E, 2017; KNUTSEN O, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-52123-7_6; KOIRANEN I, 2019; KOIRANEN I, 2017; KOIRANEN I, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.11.009; KOIVULA A, 2019; KOIVULA A, 2019; LARSSON A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0267323114531383; LEE C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.11.005; LEE J, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12077; LILLEKER D, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0267323111416182; LOADER B, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.871571; LONNQVIST J, 2019, DOI 10.1002/ijop.12496; LORENTZEN D, 2014, DOI 10.1108/ajim-09-2013-0086; MICKELSSON R, 2015; NORRIS P, 2001; NORRIS P, 2019; PASEK J, 2009, DOI 10.1080/19331680902996403; RAILO E, 2017; ROSSET J, 2013, DOI 10.1080/01402382.2013.783353; SAARINEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1080/09644016.2018.1415741; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SIVONEN J, 2018; SIVONEN J, 2018; STRANDBERG K, 2016; STRANDBERG K, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0192512117692136; STRANDBERG K, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444812470612; THE CENTRE PARTY OF F, 2019; THORSON K, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.862563; VALEN H, 1974; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VERBA S, 1978; VROMEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/13676261.2014.933198; WELLMAN B, 2003; WESTINEN J, 2015; XENOS M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.871318",9,2020,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000510316000003,ISI,UNIV TURKU;AALTO UNIV,UNIV TURKU,NA,"KOIRANEN I, 2020, TELEMAT INFORM","KOIRANEN I, 2020, TELEMAT INFORM",FINLAND;FINLAND,10.1016/j.tele.2019.101322,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,11,ELSEVIER,HELSINGIN SANOMAT FOUNDATION,WOS

MOST MODERN HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERFACES ARE DEVELOPED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY WILL BE USED BY A PERSON WITH TYPICAL PHYSICAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND PERCEPTUAL ABILITIES. ALTHOUGH SOME OPERATING SYSTEMS ALREADY INCLUDE ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES, IN MOST CASES THE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE RESPECTIVE INTERFACE CAN BE SEVERELY RESTRICTED IF A PERSON'S ABILITIES DEVIATE FROM THIS NORM. TO WHAT EXTENT THE CLASS OF 'NATURAL' USER INTERFACES-INCLUDING TOUCH, VOICE AND TOUCHLESS-ARE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND POSSIBLY MOTOR DISABILITIES IS AN IMPORTANT BUT NOT YET INVESTIGATED QUESTION. THEREFORE, THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE CURRENT ACCESSIBILITY OF THESE THREE INTERFACE TYPES. FIRST, WE CONDUCTED A FIELD STUDY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE TARGET GROUP INTERACTS WITH THESE TYPES OF INTERFACES IN GENERAL. SECOND, QUANTITATIVE DATA ON COGNITIVE AND MOTOR SKILLS WAS COLLECTED USING PARTS OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE FOR OBSERVING COMMUNICATIVE SKILLS - REVISION (OCS-R) WHICH IS WIDELY USED IN INSTITUTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN GERMANY. FINALLY, THE ACCESSIBILITY OF EACH INTERFACE TYPE WAS ANALYZED WITH THE HELP OF THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE AND AN EXPERT SURVEY, WHICH DETERMINED THE IMPORTANT AND UNIMPORTANT SKILLS REQUIRED FOR EACH INTERFACE. THESE FINDINGS SHOW HOW USABLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF NATURAL USER INTERFACES ARE FOR THIS TARGET GROUP.","KARLSRUHE UNIV APPL SCI, KARLSRUHE, GERMANY.;  CATHOLIC UNIV APPL SCI, FREIBURG, GERMANY.;  FURTWANGEN UNIV, FURTWANGEN, GERMANY.","BRAUN, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KARLSRUHE UNIV APPL SCI, KARLSRUHE, GERMANY.","ABASCAL J, 2002, DOI 10.1109/icsmc.2002.1176076; BALASURIYA S, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3292147.3292161; BARLOTT T, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1744629519831566; DASGUPTA R, 2018; DE URTURI BRETON Z, 2012, DOI 10.1186/2192-1121-1-1; DONNELLY M, 2018; FERRERAS A, 2017, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-798-6-257; GUNDOGDU R, 2017; JIMENEZ B, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0162643418766293; JOHANSSON S, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10209-020-00714-x; KOUROUPETROGLOU G, 2014; LANCIONI G, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17483107.2018.1508515; LUSSIER-DESROCHERS D, 2017, DOI 10.5817/cp2017-1-1; MONGEAU C, 2018; PRADHAN A, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3173574.3174033; RODRIGUEZ-SANCHEZ M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.05.031; SAENZ-DE-URTURI Z, 2016, DOI 10.3390/s16050704; SCHOLZ M, 2019; TORRADO J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.pmcj.2016.02.003; WILLIAMS P, 2019, DOI 10.3390/educsci9040263; WU P, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1088357614533594",3,2020,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000718888200033,ISI,KARLSRUHE UNIV APPL SCI;CATHOLIC UNIV APPL SCI;FURTWANGEN UNIV,KARLSRUHE UNIV APPL SCI,NA,"BRAUN M, 2020, NA","BRAUN M, 2020, NA",GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY,10.1109/cw49994.2020.00041,978-1-7281-6497-7,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS; ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC",3,IEEE,FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH (BMBF) IN GERMANY,WOS

THIS ALSO APPLIES TO SWITZERLAND, WHERE THE SHARE OF OLDER ADULTS USING SMARTPHONES AND INSTANT MESSAGING SERVICES IS CONSTANTLY RISING. THE EFFECTS OF INSTANT MESSAGING SERVICES IN TERMS OF SOCIAL NEEDS HAVE BEEN STUDIED MAINLY REGARDING YOUNGER AND MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. ACCORDING TO SOCIOEMOTIONAL SELECTIVITY THEORY, HOWEVER, OLDER ADULTS HAVE DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS AND NEEDS REGARDING THEIR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THEREFORE, THE RESULTS OF STUDIES ON YOUNGER POPULATION GROUPS CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED TO OLDER POPULATION GROUPS. TO BRIDGE THIS RESEARCH GAP, WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE STUDY WITH 30 OLDER ADULTS (65+) IN SWITZERLAND. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF USING WHATSAPP ON THEIR SUBJECTIVELY PERCEIVED QUALITY OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND EXAMINED WHETHER THE SOCIOEMOTIONAL SELECTIVITY THEORY IS STILL VALID IN THE FACE OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT USING WHATSAPP IS IN LINE WITH THE SOCIOEMOTIONAL SELECTIVITY THEORY AND HAS AN INTENSIFYING EFFECT ON SOCIAL RELATIONS OF OLDER USERS. WHATSAPP IS USED VERY CONSCIOUSLY TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE ENDS BY ALLOWING OLDER USERS TO SELECT AND INVEST TIME IN MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS.","UNIV APPL SCI FHS ST GALLEN, INST AGEING RES, ROSENBERGSTR 59, ST GALLEN, SWITZERLAND.","HAMMERLE, V (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV APPL SCI FHS ST GALLEN, INST AGEING RES, ROSENBERGSTR 59, ST GALLEN, SWITZERLAND.","ARIEL Y, 2017, DOI 10.1080/13537121.2017.1345422; BARBER S, 2016, DOI 10.3758/s13421-016-0612-0; BUNDESAMT FUR STATISTIK B, 2017; CARSTENSEN L, 2003, DOI 10.1023/a:1024569803230; CARSTENSEN L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00348.x; CZAJA SARA J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10209-006-0060-x; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; KAHN R L, 1980, DOI 10.1038/nature12518; KARAPANOS E, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.10.015; KIM Y, 2016, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2015.0408; LANG F, 1998, DOI 10.1093/geronb/53b.1.p21; LICOPPE C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2004.11.001; MAYRING P, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-94-017-9181-6_13; PELIZAUSHOFFMEIH, 2013; ROSALES A, 2016, DOI 10.21018/rjcpr.2016.1.200; SEIFERT A, 2016; SHELDON K, 2001, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.80.2.325; TAIPALE S, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-92034-4_40",1,2020,COMPUTER SCIENCE; HEALTH CARE SCIENCES & SERVICES; GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY; MEDICAL INFORMATICS,WOS:000615961300009,ISI,UNIV APPL SCI FHS ST GALLEN,UNIV APPL SCI FHS ST GALLEN,NA,"HAMMERLE V, 2020, NA","HAMMERLE V, 2020, NA",SWITZERLAND,10.5220/0009470100930098,978-989-758-420-6,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; HEALTH CARE SCIENCES & SERVICES; GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY; MEDICAL INFORMATICS",1,SCITEPRESS,SWISS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [10DL11_183117/1],WOS

NOTING THE BENEFICIAL OVERALL IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KEY SDGS IN RELATION TO REDUCED POVERTY AND MISERY, AND INCREASED SOCIAL EQUALITY AND ECOLOGICAL BALANCE, THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORTS FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES THAT DIGITALIZATION POSES. AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE: THE THREAT OF INCREASING SOCIAL INEQUALITY AS A RESULT OF THE NEW INTERNATIONAL DIVISION OF LABOUR, THE HYPER-CONCENTRATION OF THE DIGITAL MARKET, THE GROWING DIGITAL INEQUALITY, THE THREAT TO INFORMATION SECURITY, AND THE WEAKENING OF THE REGULATORY CAPACITY OF THE STATE. THE AUTHORS OF THE REPORTS NOTE THAT DIGITALIZATION IS A CONTROVERSIAL PROCESS THAT CAN BOTH HELP TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND UNWITTINGLY HINDER THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. IN ORDER FOR DIGITALIZATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SDGS, TARGETED AND COORDINATED INTERGOVERNMENTAL POLICY INVOLVING NATIONAL AND BUSINESS STAKEHOLDERS IS IMPORTANT.","LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, DEPT ECON HIST & HIST ECON THOUGHT, FAC ECON, 1-46 LENINSKIE GORY, MOSCOW 119991, RUSSIA.;  RUSSIAN ACAD SCI, INST ECON, URAL BRANCH, 29 MOSKOVSKAYA STR, EKATERINBURG 620014, RUSSIA.;  NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON, CTR SKILLS DEV & VOCAT EDUC, INST EDUC, 20 MYASNITSKAYA STR, MOSCOW 101000, RUSSIA.","MALTSEV, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, DEPT ECON HIST & HIST ECON THOUGHT, FAC ECON, 1-46 LENINSKIE GORY, MOSCOW 119991, RUSSIA.; MALTSEV, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), RUSSIAN ACAD SCI, INST ECON, URAL BRANCH, 29 MOSKOVSKAYA STR, EKATERINBURG 620014, RUSSIA.",NA,0,2020,INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,WOS:000613088000009,ISI,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV;INST ECON;NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV;INST ECON,NA,"MALTSEV A, 2020, VESTN MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGAN","MALTSEV A, 2020, VESTN MEZHDUNARODNYKH ORGAN",RUSSIA;RUSSIA;RUSSIA,10.17323/1996-7845-2020-04-09,NA,INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS,0,NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,NA,WOS

THE ANALYSIS CONCLUDES BY HIGHLIGHTING THAT FOR ADOLESCENTS THE INTERNET IS PREDOMINANTLY AN ENTERTAINMENT SPACE. THEIR DISCOURSE DOES NOT DISPLAY SPONTANEOUS PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS.

ISSUES JOURNAL.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT; ACCESS; DIGITAL INFORMATION OPENNESS,INTERNET,"IN THE CONTEXT OF RUSSIA'S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, THE SYSTEMIC DIGITALIZATION OF THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND THE AUTHORITIES IS GAINING PARTICULAR RELEVANCE. THE DIALOGUE INVOLVES DEALING WITH VARIOUS PROBLEMS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY, WHICH INCLUDE NOT ONLY ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND INDIVIDUAL USER SKILLS BUT ALSO ENSURING SIMPLE PROCESS OF GETTING THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES' ACTIVITY. THE ROLE OF THE AUTHORITIES HERE IS PROVIDING THE ""DIGITAL INFORMATION OPENNESS"", I.E. REPORTING TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THEIR WORK, RECEIVING FEEDBACK FROM THE RESIDENTS AND INVOLVING THEM IN THE INFORMATIONAL DIALOGUE. AUTHORITIES' DIGITAL INFORMATION OPENNESS WILL HELP TO MAKE THEM APPROACHABLE FOR PEOPLE AND ACHIEVE ""TWO-WAY"" COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC. THIS WILL KEEP THE GOVERNMENT BODIES WELL INFORMED ABOUT THE REAL SOCIO-POLITICAL SITUATION IN THE REGION AND GUARANTEE THE PUBLIC'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING DECISIONS ON DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGION AND MUNICIPALITIES. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES WEB RESOURCES OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND SOCIAL NETWORK ACCOUNTS OF HIGHEST OFFICIALS IN EIGHT RF CONSTITUENT TERRITORIES WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS OF SUPPORTING THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN AUTHORITIES AND THE PUBLIC AND DEVELOPING DIGITAL INFORMATION OPENNESS IS FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEGISLATIVE REGULATION.","RUSSIAN ACAD EDUC, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;  LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;  LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM, DEPT MEDIA THEORY & ECON, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","VARTANOVA, EL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), RUSSIAN ACAD EDUC, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.; VARTANOVA, EL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","ACHARYA B, 2017; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; AVGEROU C, 2008, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000136; AVILA A, 2009; БРОДОВСКАЯ ЕВ BRODOVSKAYA E, 2013; COLLEY A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2007.09.002; COMPAINE B, 2001; DAVAKI K, 2018; DELITSYN L, 2003; DEVIATKO I, 2013; DUNAS D, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17447143.2020.1751648; GLADKOVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17447143.2020.1745212; GLADKOVA A, 2019, DOI 10.30547/vestnik.journ.4.2019.4172; GLADKOVA E, 2019; ISRAELASHVILI M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.07.015; KARISHINA I, 2020, DOI 10.24411/2226-6720-2020-10015; KOSARETSKII S, 2010; KUZNETSOV A, 2014; NIEMINEN H, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0267323115614198; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; PARK S, 2017; PERUSKO Z, 2013; POLOZHIKHINA M, 2017; RAGNEDDA M, 2013; RYKOV Y, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-69784-0_6; SMIRNOVA O, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-32706-4; VAN DIJK J, 2013; VARTANOVA E, 2002, DOI 10.1177/17480485020640050501; VARTANOVA E L, 2015; ZHEREBIN V, 2015",0,2020,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000603370300001,ISI,RUSSIAN ACAD EDUC;LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV;LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,RUSSIAN ACAD EDUC;LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,NA,"VARTANOVA EL, 2020, THEOR PRACT ISSUES JOURNAL","VARTANOVA EL, 2020, THEOR PRACT ISSUES JOURNAL",RUSSIA;RUSSIA;RUSSIA,10.17150/2308-6203.2020.9(4).575-594,NA,COMMUNICATION,0,BAIKAL STATE UNIV,NA,WOS

THIS ISSUE BECAME RELEVANT WITH THE INCREASE OF THE RATE OF THE INTERNET SPREAD IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE LAG OF OTHER COUNTRIES BEHIND THEM IN THE LATE 90S AND EARLY 21ST CENTURY. THE SPHERE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IS ONE OF THE MOST RAPIDLY CHANGING ONES, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE STUDY OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY ARE STILL NOT CLEARLY DEFINED, WHICH ACTUALIZES RESEARCH IN THIS AREA AND THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING TRENDS IN THE WORLD AND INDIVIDUAL STATES. THE PURPOSE OF OUR WORK IS THE USAGE OF THE THREE-LEVEL MODEL OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY FOR ASSESSING FIRST-LEVEL DIFFERENCES AMONG POPULATION OF THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES AND RUSSIAN REGIONS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE RESEARCH RESULTS WILL CREATE PREREQUISITES FOR CONTINUING STUDY ON OTHER LEVELS OF DIGITAL ASYMMETRY AMONG RUSSIAN POPULATION, WHICH WILL ALLOW REVEALING NOT JUST THE FACT OF ITS INCLUSION IN DIGITAL SPACE BUT THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES AND OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDE BY THE USAGE OF MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES.

IT IS REVEALED THAT RUSSIA, IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF THE SHARE OF INTERNET USERS, AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN RUSSIAN REGIONS EVEN WITH THE DECREASE OF VARIATION COEFFICIENTS.

ACCORDING TO STUDIES [1,2,3,4] THIS IS USUALLY DONE THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES AS TEACHING RESOURCES. THE SKILLS INVOLVED IN THE USE OF INFORMATION ARE BECOMING MORE RELEVANT OVER TIME. THE MAIN GOALS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION AS A SUPPORTING TOOL AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS IT PRODUCES IN THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT; THIS RAISES A QUESTION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNALIZING THE USE OF TECHNOLOGIES IN EDUCATION TO ENCOURAGE LEARNING AND ITS ADAPTABILITY TO DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. FIRSTLY, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE INTERIORIZATION OF TECHNOLOGIES IS ACHIEVED WE ANALYSED THE DIFFERENT STAGES USERS GO THROUGH, NAMELY: ACCESS (ACQUISITION), ADOPTION (CONSUMPTION) AND APPROPRIATION (INTERNALISATION). SPECIAL EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON THE LAST STAGE SINCE THIS ONE ALLOWS THE USER TO GENERATE ITS OWN CONTENT AND GET USED TO THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED. NEW TECHNOLOGIES ALWAYS CREATE A BARRIER BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN USE THEM FLUENTLY AND THOSE WHO CAN NOT, BUT THIS GOES BEYOND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN OUR SENSE, THE TERM FLUIDITY REFERS TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND HOW TO BUILD SIGNIFICANT LEARNING OF CONTENTS PRODUCED BY THIS TECHNOLOGY. DUE TO THE REASONS ABOVE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO GO BEYOND THE MERE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND TO ACQUIRE REAL FLUIDITY WITH THEM. FINALLY, AIMING TO ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY INCLUSION IN EDUCATION AS A TOOL THAT CANNOT BE LIMITED AS A MERE RESOURCE IN THE CLASSROOM, THE IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING TEACHING STAFF IN DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS STUDIED. TO CONCLUDE, IN THE PRESENT RESEARCH WE SUGGEST THE NECESSITY OF DIDACTICAL TRAINING BEYOND TECHNICAL TRAINING, TO MAKE SURE THAT ICT ENCOURAGES LEARNING AND CONTRIBUTE TO EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION.","UNIV SALAMANCA, SALAMANCA, SPAIN.","HUESO, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SALAMANCA, SALAMANCA, SPAIN.","APARICI R, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c38-2012-02-05; AREA M, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c38-2011-02-01; B-\AAKE L, 2016; BADILLA-SAXE E, 2002; BAUMAN Z, 2005; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; ALMENARA J, 2018, DOI 10.6018/rie.36.2.292951; COBO ROMANI J, 2006; COMPAINE B, 2001; COOPER J, 2003; DE-MORAGAS SPA M, 2005; FINQUELIEVICH S, 2004; GARCIA-VALCARCEL A, 2014, DOI 10.3916/c42-2014-06; HOFFMAN D, 1998, DOI 10.1126/science.280.5362.390; INNERARITY D, 2009; JONASSEN D, 2002; LISTER M, 2008; BORDALBA M, 2018, DOI 10.6018/rie.36.1.290111; MASLOW A, 1981; CAMBRON A, 2015, DOI 10.4438/1988-592x-re-2015-369-293; MONEREO I FONT C, 2001; ORNELLAS A, 2015, DOI 10.6018/reifop.18.3.190271; PISCITELLI A, 2002; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; SOBRADO-FERNANDEZ L, 2006; STROVER S, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00008-8; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002; VAZQUEZ J, 2003",0,2020,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000558088803108,ISI,UNIV SALAMANCA,UNIV SALAMANCA,NA,"HUESO M, 2020, NA","HUESO M, 2020, NA",SPAIN,978-84-09-17939-8,978-84-09-17939-8,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,IATED-INT ASSOC TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION & DEVELOPMENT,NA,WOS

BASED ON AN EXTENSIVE QUALITATIVE STUDY, THE DIVERSITY OF SUPPORT NETWORKS AND SUPPORTS SEEKING PATTERNS ARE UNVEILED. A TYPOLOGY OF SIX PATTERNS OF HELP-SEEKING IS PRESENTED AND DESCRIBED: THE SUPPORT-DEPRIVED, THE COMMUNITY-SUPPORTED, THE SUPPORTED THROUGH SUBSTITUTION, THE NETWORK-SUPPORTED, THE VICARIOUS LEARNERS, AND THE SELF-SUPPORTED. THE ARTICLE ALSO CRITICALLY ENGAGES WITH THE OFTEN UNNUANCED ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON SOCIAL SUPPORT. THE RESEARCH AND THE TYPOLOGY REVEAL THAT THE QUALITY OF SUPPORT, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL SUPPORT, IS NOT ONLY INFLUENCED BY SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS. RATHER, THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND THE LEVEL OF INTIMACY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS IS AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF SUPPORT-SEEKING. AS SUCH, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT MECHANISMS OF IN/EXCLUSION ARE HIGHLY SOCIAL, AS THEY ENTAIL A DIVERSITY OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL SUPPORT-SEEKING PATTERNS, WHICH IN TURN HAVE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON THE ADOPTION AND USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT UNDERSTANDING SUCH MECHANISMS IS ROOTED IN RECONCILING MICRO-LEVEL INTERACTIONS TO MACRO-LEVEL PATTERNS OF INEQUALITIES. TO SHOW THE SPECIFICITY OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WITHIN DIGITAL INEQUALITIES RESEARCH, AND TO DEMARCATE THE CONCEPT FROM DEFINITIONS OF OTHER ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES, THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL INCLUSION IS INTRODUCED.

CONSIDERING THAT DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY IS A NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR INCLUSION, WE IDENTIFY WHICH TYPES OF DIGITAL LITERACIES ARE LINKED TO THE ACQUISITION OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES, CONFIDENCE, AND DISPOSITIONS TOWARDS THE INCORPORATION OF ICTS INTO DAILY ACTIVITIES; ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO IDENTIFY DIGITAL LITERACIES THAT MIGHT ENGENDER MOTIVATED PROCESSES OF SELF-EXCLUSION FROM THE DIGITAL REALM, THEREFORE REINFORCING SUBJECTS' DIGITAL EXCLUSION. METHODOLOGICALLY, THIS ARTICLE IS BASED ON 30 IN-DEPTH BIOGRAPHICALLY-ORIENTED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING IN THE REGION OF MADRID, SPAIN. REGARDING RESULTS, FOUR TECHNO-SOCIAL DIMENSIONS ARE PROPOSED-MOTIVATION, DEGREE OF FORMALITY, DEGREE OF SOCIALITY, AND TYPE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DOMESTICATION-TO CONSTRUCT A TYPOLOGY OF FOUR IDEAL FORMS OF DIGITAL LITERACY: UNCONSCIOUS LITERACY, SELF-MOTIVATED LITERACY, PROFESSIONAL LITERACY, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. TO ACHIEVE DIGITAL INCLUSION, SELF-MOTIVATION TOWARDS USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IS MANDATORY, BUT SOCIAL PRACTICES, ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL LITERACY MIGHT WORK AS A SECONDARY SOCIALIZATION PROCESS THAT ENHANCE SUBJECTS' AFFINITY WITH ICTS. NEVERTHELESS, THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL SUPPORT IS AMBIVALENT: IT COULD PROMOTE DIGITAL INCLUSION AMONG PEOPLE ALREADY INTERESTED IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, BUT IT COULD ALSO LEAD TO DYNAMICS OF SELF-EXCLUSION AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CONFIDENT REGARDING THEIR DIGITAL COMPETENCIES OR DISINTERESTED IN ICTS.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIAL ANTHROPOL & SOCIAL PSYCHOL, MADRID 28223, SPAIN.","GOMEZ, DC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIAL ANTHROPOL & SOCIAL PSYCHOL, MADRID 28223, SPAIN.","ALONSO L, 1998; ANTONIO A, 2014, DOI 10.3390/fi6040673; BOLIN G, 2018, DOI 10.4324/9781315398624-3; BOURDIEU P, 1979; CASTANO C, 2011, DOI 10.5477/cis/reis.136.127; COMPAINE B, 2001; COURTOIS C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814562162; DUTTON W, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1353640; ERSTAD O, 2011; GHOBADI S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2013.833650; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HUANG K, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010005; KVASNY L, 2005; LASEN A, 2014; LEE H, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.02.001; LUPAC P, 2018; MARIEN I, 2014, DOI 10.1108/info-07-2014-0030; MCPHERSON, 2008, DOI 10.1162/dmal.9780262633598.101; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819869604; REISDORF B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815621539; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROJAS V, 2012; SEFTON-GREEN J, 2009, DOI 10.1080/15544800902741556; SILVERSTONE R, 1993, DOI 10.1108/eb051328; VALLES M, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2014; WENGRAF T, 2001, DOI 10.4135/9781849209717; WILLIAMS J, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s10798-011-9196-y",1,2020,SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000539206000009,ISI,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,NA,"GOMEZ DC, 2020, SOC INCL","GOMEZ DC, 2020, SOC INCL",SPAIN,10.17645/si.v8i2.2601,NA,"SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",1,COGITATIO PRESS,COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID [FEI-EU-17-24],WOS

IT ANALYSES (1) SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTUALISATIONS THAT ARE USED WHEN STUDYING INTERNET USE AND NON-USE IN LATER LIFE, (2) POLICIES THAT ADDRESS OLDER ADULTS' INTERNET (NON-)USE IN AUSTRIA AND (3) CHARACTERISTICS OF OLDER AUSTRIAN NON-USERS OF THE INTERNET BASED ON THE SURVEY OF HEALTH, AGEING AND RETIREMENT IN EUROPE (SHARE, WAVE 6).

THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO THE USE OF E-GOVERNMENT AND E-PARTICIPATION SERVICES. WE USED THE MICRO-DATA FROM THE NATIONAL SURVEY ON THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES BY THE GREEK HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS. THIS SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE GREEK STATISTICAL AUTHORITY IN 2017, IN A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE GREEK POPULATION (N = 3321). WE ANALYZED THE DATA USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION EQUATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, THE SOCIAL EXCLUSION FACTORS MAY INFLUENCE THE USE OF E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. THE MOST IMPORTANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING THE DECISION TO USE E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES ARE THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AGE AND CITIZENSHIP. THE E-PARTICIPATION OF THE CITIZENS IN VARIOUS DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES IS ONLY INFLUENCED BY THEIR EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. THIS WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO EVERY ASPECT OF OUR DIGITAL LIFE. THE STATE SHOULD IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOCUSING ON THE VULNERABLE SOCIAL SUBGROUPS, SUCH AS THE LOW-EDUCATED AND OLDER PEOPLE. THE FINDINGS OF OUR RESEARCH MAY HELP THE POLICYMAKERS TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE EFFECT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO E-GOVERNMENT ADOPTION, IN A MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND INTEGRATIVE WAY.","UNIV WESTERN MACEDONIA, DEPT BUSINESS ADM, GREVENA, GREECE.;  UNIV IOANNINA, DEPT MATH, IOANNINA, GREECE.;  INT HELLEN UNIV, DEPT ACCOUNTING & FINANCE, KAVALA, GREECE.","GOUNOPOULOS, E (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV WESTERN MACEDONIA, DEPT BUSINESS ADM, GREVENA, GREECE.","BELANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; BRUNO G, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2010.534364; CAPGEMINI, 2012; COLESCA S, 2008; LUNA-REYES L, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2012.03.001; GOLDFINCH S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8500.2009.00643.x; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; KOKKONIS E, 2018; LIM J, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-38862-0_26; PIETERSON W, 2007; ROSENBERG D, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818799632; SAVOLDELLI A, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2014.01.008; THOMPSON D, 2005, DOI 10.1108/09564230510614022; UNITED-NATIONS, 2012; VAN DEURSEN A, 2006; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WIRTHMANN A, 2011; WORLD B, 2008; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2014.06.004",0,2020,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000526350600028,ISI,UNIV WESTERN MACEDONIA;UNIV IOANNINA;INT HELLEN UNIV,UNIV WESTERN MACEDONIA,NA,"GOUNOPOULOS E, 2020, NA","GOUNOPOULOS E, 2020, NA",GREECE;GREECE;GREECE,10.18502/kss.v4i1.6002,NA,ECONOMICS,1,KNOWLEDGE E,NA,WOS

BUT TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS TO BOOST THE ECONOMY OR TO FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE MANNER, ARE OFTEN MISSING THE SOCIAL DIMENSION AND COULD GENERATE A SOCIAL INEQUALITY PHENOMENON KNOWN AS 'DIGITAL DIVIDE'. THIS TERM WAS FIRST USED IN THE 1990S, WHEN A GAP WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAD ACCESS TO ICT AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. TODAY, THE MAIN CONCERN REGARDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS FOCUSED ON POOR PEOPLE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THEM BECOMING EVEN MORE MARGINALIZED DUE TO THE LACK OF BASIC SKILLS USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR THE CAPACITY TO AFFORD THEM. STARTING FROM THIS THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, I WILL EXTEND MY ANALYSIS TO THE FIELD OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICIES AND PROGRAMS AND ASK THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTION: WHAT IS EU'S PLAN FOR TACKLING WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES' POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE 'DIGITAL GAP'? I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY ANALYSING STRATEGIC DOCUMENTS OR PUBLIC POLICIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. EU POLICIES AIMED AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL ECONOMY AND INFORMATION SOCIETY REPRESENT A STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF PUBLIC POLICIES, REFERRING TO THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE CURRENT DIGITAL SPACE AND TO THE UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES IN THE COMPANIES OF THE EU MEMBER STATES. EVEN THOUGH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S DIGITAL AGENDA OF 2015 - WITH GOALS SUCH AS PROVIDING BROADBAND ACCESS TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE EU AND 75% OF EUROPEANS USING THE INTERNET - THERE IS A DANGER THAT STANDARDS RELATED TO BROADBAND AND FAST INTERNET WILL NOT BE REACHED, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS.

EVEN THOUGH INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH AFRICA, A PROVIDER OF OPEN DISTANCE LEARNING (ODL), CAN OPEN ACCESS TO HE FOR MANY MARGINALISED AND PERIPHERAL COMMUNITIES, WE CANNOT SEPARATE ACCESS TO ODL EDUCATION FROM THE DEBATE OF ACCESS TO ICTS. STUDENTS IN URBAN AREAS HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE TO STUDENTS WITH POOR ICT ACCESS IN URBAN, PERI-URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE NATURE OF ACCESS TO ICT AND HOW THIS AFFECTS STUDENTS' ABILITY TO ACCESS HE.","COPPERBELT UNIV, DIRECTORATE DISTANCE EDUC & OPEN LEARNING, KITWE, ZAMBIA.;  UNIV SOUTH AFRICA, DEPT GEOG, PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.;  OPEN UNIV, DEPT GEOG, MILTON KEYNES, BUCKS, ENGLAND.","LEMBANI, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), COPPERBELT UNIV, DIRECTORATE DISTANCE EDUC & OPEN LEARNING, KITWE, ZAMBIA.","AJADI T O, 2010; BORNMAN E, 2015; BREINES M, 2019, DOI 10.1080/17450101.2019.1618565; BROADB C, 2013; BROWN C, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00369.x; BUCY E, 2000, DOI 10.1162/108118000568967; CORROCHER N, 2002, DOI 10.1080/02683960210132061; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2005; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2010; DE HAAN J, 2004, DOI 10.1002/9780470773529.ch1; DIXON L, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12088; ENOCH Y, 2006, DOI 10.1080/02680510600713045; EVANS O, 2018, DOI 10.1108/dprg-04-2018-0018; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; FURUHOLT B, 2007; GIEBEL M, 2013; GRAHAM M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2014.910087; GUNTER A, 2018, DOI 10.1080/14767724.2017.1401453; HAHS-VAUGHN D, 2004, DOI 10.1353/csd.2004.0057; HILL C, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1360080x.2018.1531211; HINDMAN D, 2000, DOI 10.1177/107769900007700306; JONES C, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2010.00379.x; KALIISA R, 2017, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781107415324.004; LESAME Z, 2013; LI Y, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.08.001; LIEBENBERG H, 2012, DOI 10.19173/irrodl.v13i4.1303; LIN M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.iref.2016.02.014; MADGE C, 2019, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2019.1628048; MASSING C, 2017; MCPHEE S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/03098265.2017.1331208; MIDDLETON C, 2013; MITTELMEIER J, 2019; MYKHNENKO V, 2016, DOI 10.1080/03098265.2016.1217832; OYEDEMI T, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2011.12.001; OYEDEMI T, 2009; OYELARAN-OYEYINKA B, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.05.002; PASHAPA T, 2017, DOI 10.1080/09718524.2018.1434994; PENARD T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2015.03.004; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; PRENSKY M, 2010; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROSSI-HANSBERG E, 2013, DOI 10.3386/w18534; UNESCO, 2016; VAN AUDENHOVE L, 2003; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VIEIRA C, 2017; WARF B, 2019, DOI 10.1080/00221341.2018.1518990; WARSCHAUER M, 2010, DOI 10.3102/0091732x09349791",39,2020,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH; GEOGRAPHY,WOS:000497943500001,ISI,COPPERBELT UNIV;UNIV SOUTH AFRICA;OPEN UNIV,COPPERBELT UNIV,NA,"LEMBANI R, 2020, J GEOGR HIGH EDUC","LEMBANI R, 2020, J GEOGR HIGH EDUC",UNITED KINGDOM;SOUTH AFRICA;ZAMBIA,10.1080/03098265.2019.1694876,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH; GEOGRAPHY,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL; NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION (NRF), SOUTH AFRICA [ES/P002161/1, UTSA160329161196]; NEWTON GRANT; ESRC [ES/P002161/1] FUNDING SOURCE: UKRI",WOS

CROSS-SECTIONAL COMPARATIVE DESIGN WAS USED AND A NATIONAL SURVEY FROM THE SWEDISH MEDIA COUNCIL WAS COGNITIVELY ADAPTED FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AGED 13-20 YEARS. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PROPORTION OF THE 114 PARTICIPATING ADOLESCENTS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES HAD ACCESS TO INTERNET-ENABLED DEVICES AND PERFORMED INTERNET ACTIVITIES, EXCEPT FOR PLAYING GAMES, THAN THE REFERENCE GROUP (N = 1161).

THE VALIDATION PROCEDURE SHOWS THAT THE DIGITAL CAPITAL INDEX IS ASSOCIATED WITH SOCIOECONOMIC AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS, SUCH AS AGE, INCOME, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND PLACE OF RESIDENCE, WHILE IT APPEARS NOT TO BE RELATED TO GENDER.","NORTHUMBRIA UNIV, MASS COMMUN, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.;  NORTHUMBRIA UNIV, FAC ART & SOCIAL SCI, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.;  SALERNO UNIV, DEPT POLIT SOCIAL & COMMUN SCI, RES METHODS, SALERNO, ITALY.","RAGNEDDA, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NORTHUMBRIA UNIV, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 8ST, TYNE & WEAR, ENGLAND.","AESAERT K, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2015.03.014; AKIYOSHI M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/01972240802356067; ANTHIAS F, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0268580912463155; ASHMORE F, 2015, DOI 10.1080/14702541.2014.978808; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BLANK G, 2015; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BOULIANNE S, 2009, DOI 10.1080/10584600902854363; CARRETERO S, 2017; CLARK C, 2001, DOI 10.1207/s15327892mcp0303_7; COMREY A L, 1992; CRAMPTON J, 2003; CRANG M, 2006, DOI 10.1080/00420980600970664; DI FRANCO G, 2013; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DUTTON W, 2013; EMMISON M, 1998; ESHET-ALKALAI Y, 2010; FOSTER W, 2004; FOX S, 2004; FRAILLON J, 2014; FRANKO, 2012; GERD P, 2005; GORSKI, 2002, DOI 10.1207/s15327892mcp0402_7; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HAMELINK C, 2000; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2003; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.957711; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HOFFMAN D, 1998, DOI 10.1126/science.280.5362.390; JIMOYIANNIS A, 2010, DOI 10.4018/jdldc.2010101903; JONES-KAVALIER B, 2008; JUNG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03601270903183313; KAISER H, 1960, DOI 10.1177/001316446002000116; KATZ J, 1997, DOI 10.1145/248448.248464; KATZ J, 2002; KYRIAKIDOU V, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2011.09.001; LEE B, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.01.003; LITT E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813475424; MARDIS M, 2013, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2013.783595; MARTIN S, 2007, DOI 10.1525/sp.2007.54.1.1; MOSSBERGER K, 2007; MURPHY H, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2015.06.004; NAPOLI P, 2014; NEVES B, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1440783318766119; NEVES B, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.2998; NIEHAVES B, 2014, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2013.19; NORRIS P, 2001; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PALFREY J, 2008; PARK S, 2017; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; PHILIP L, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.12.002; PRIEUR A, 2013, DOI 10.1080/14616696.2012.748930; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; RAGNEDDA M, 2019; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; RAGNEDDA M, 2015; RAGNEDDA M, 2013; RIDDLESDEN D, 2016; ROBINSON L, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807072216; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROJAS V, 2004; ROSENTHAL R, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03601270801949427; RUIU M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2017.1318642; SEALE C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.016; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SIPIOR J, 2002; STERN M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00302.x; TALUKDAR D, 2011; TOWNSEND L, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0269094213496974; TSATSOU P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0163443710393865; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WARF B, 2001, DOI 10.1068/b2691; WASSERMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00301.x; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WHITE P, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2011.611816; WILSON K, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0894439303021002001; WITTE J, 2010; ZHANG X, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.12.011; ZICKUHR K, 2012; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",40,2020,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000484385400001,ISI,NORTHUMBRIA UNIV;NORTHUMBRIA UNIV;SALERNO UNIV,NORTHUMBRIA UNIV,NA,"RAGNEDDA M, 2020, NEW MEDIA SOC","RAGNEDDA M, 2020, NEW MEDIA SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;ITALY,10.1177/1461444819869604,NA,COMMUNICATION,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,BRITISH ACADEMY [SRG18R1\ 180983],WOS

THE FINDINGS ALSO SUGGEST A WIDENING OF THE DIGITAL GAP BETWEEN GENERATIONS AND SOCIOECONOMIC GROUPS IN FAVOUR OF THE YOUNGER, THE BETTER EDUCATED, AND THE UPPER CLASSES.","UNIV POMPEU FABRA, DEPT CIENCIES POLIT & SOCIALS, RAMON TRIAS FARGAS 25-27, BARCELONA 08005, SPAIN.; DEPT CIENCIES POLIT & SOCIALS, RAMON TRIAS FARGAS 25-27, BARCELONA 08005, SPAIN.","AGLAMAZ, FS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV POMPEU FABRA, DEPT CIENCIES POLIT & SOCIALS, RAMON TRIAS FARGAS 25-27, BARCELONA 08005, SPAIN.","ADLER P, 2002, DOI 10.2307/4134367; ARAL S, 2011, DOI 10.1086/661238; BALTAGI B, 2005; BAYM N, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10714421.2011.573442; BEAUDOIN C, 2004, DOI n c, 2004, j mass commun q, v81; BECK U, 2002; BOHN A, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2013.11.003; BOURDIEU P, 1984; BOYD D, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00393.x; BRANDOLINI A, 2007; BROWN T A, 2015; BURT R, 1984, DOI 10.1016/0378-8733(84)90007-8; BURT R, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0378-8733(97)00003-8; BYRNE B, 1989, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.456; BYRNE B, 2012; ALVAREZ E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.gaceta.2016.09.002; CHO J, 2015, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2014.0657; COLEMAN J, 1988, DOI 10.1086/228943; DE MEO P, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2629438; DE ZUNIGA H, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2012.01574.x; DONATH J, 2004, DOI 10.1023/b:bttj.0000047585.06264.cc; DYER N, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.leaqua.2004.09.009; ELLISON N, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; ELLISON N, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12078; ENARD T, 2005; ENGBERS T, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s11205-016-1299-0; ERICKSON B, 1996, DOI 10.1086/230912; ERIKSON R, 1992; EVANS G, 2000; GRANOVETTER M, 1973, DOI 10.1086/225469; HAYTHORNTHWAITE C, 2005, DOI 10.1080/13691180500146185; HAYTHORNTHWAITE C, 2000, DOI 10.1177/14614440022225779; HU L, 1999, DOI 10.1080/10705519909540118; JOHNSTON K, 2013, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2010.550063; KATZ J, 2002; KIM H, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00369.x; KOCH G, 1983; KWON M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0270467613496767; LIN C, 1996; LIN N, 1986, DOI 10.1016/0378-8733(86)90003-1; LIN N, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511815447; LIN N, 2008; LIN N, 1999; LIN N, 2000; LIN N, 2008; LING R, 2008; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808089415; LONGFORD N, 1992, DOI 10.1007/bf02294421; LUDTKE O, 2008, DOI 10.1037/a0012869; MARWICK A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810365313; MATHISEN G, 2006, DOI 10.1348/096317905x52869; MCPHERSON M, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415; MESCH G, 2010; MESCH G, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0093650211398865; MICHELI M, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1139614; MUTHEN B, 1991, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-3984.1991.tb00363.x; MUTHEN B, 1994, DOI 10.1177/0049124194022003006; MUTHEN L, 2017; NEVES B, 2015, DOI 10.1080/03906701.2015.1050307; NEZLEK J, 2001, DOI 10.1177/0146167201277001; NIE N, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121957277; PACHUCKI M, 2010, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102615; PAPACHARISSI Z, 2011; POLEY M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.012; PUTNAM R D, 2002; PUTNAM R, 2000; QUAN-HAASE A, 2004; RABAN D, 2011, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.542824; RAUDENBUSH S, 1991, DOI 10.2307/1165105; RESNICK P, 2001, DOI 10.1145/358916.362079; RHEINGOLD H, 2003; SIEMENS G, 2005, DOI 10.3109/0142159x.2016.1173661; SNIJDERS T, 1999; TURKLE S, 1995; UTZ S, 2015, DOI 10.3390/soc5020420; VALENZUELA S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x; VAN DE SCHOOT R, 2015, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01064; VAN DER GAAG M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2004.10.001; VAN DER GAAG M, 2004; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VANDENBERG R, 2000, DOI 10.1177/109442810031002; WELLMAN B, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121957286; WELLMAN B, 1988; WELLMAN B, 2002; WELLMAN B, 2002; WILKINSON J, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0038038510362484; WILLIAMS D, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2006.00029.x; WOLF E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0013164413495237; ZHANG N, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s10916-005-5898-6",0,2021,LITERATURE; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000744212400001,ISI,UNIV POMPEU FABRA,UNIV POMPEU FABRA,NA,"AGLAMAZ FS, 2021, POETICS","AGLAMAZ FS, 2021, POETICS",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.poetic.2021.101565,NA,LITERATURE; SOCIOLOGY,0,ELSEVIER,SPANISH MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y COMPETITIVIDAD (MINECO) [CSO2016-80484-R],WOS

THIS STRATEGY IS GENERALLY UNSUCCESSFUL, PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS OFTEN LACK A SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEM AND SO THEY TURN TO ONLINE STRANGERS FOR HELP RATHER THAN PEOPLE THEY KNOW OFFLINE. OTHERS DO NOT EVEN TRY TO GET HELP OVER SOCIAL MEDIA, BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WISH THEM HARM FINDING THEM ONLINE, OR FOR THEIR REPUTATIONS IF THEY ADMIT TO BEING HOMELESS AND NEEDING HELP. THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS INVEST THEIR EFFORTS IN LOCATING SURVIVAL SUPPORT OVER SOCIAL MEDIA AND CROWDFUNDING AND THE BARRIERS THEY EXPERIENCE ALONG THE WAY. REPORTING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK WITH UNSTABLY HOUSED ADULTS IN CHICAGO, THE STUDY INTRODUCES THE CONCEPT OF CONNECTIVE AMBITION TO DESCRIBE HOW PLATFORM NARRATIVES TAKE HOLD IN A CONTEXT OF DEEP EXCLUSION, INFORMING A VIEW OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS A VAST TERRAIN OF UNTAPPED SUPPORT FROM STRANGERS. DIGITAL INEQUALITY EMERGES IN THE FAILURE OF CAMPAIGNS TO RAISE MONEY FOR RENT FROM VIRTUAL TIES, BUT ALSO IN HOW LIMITED SKILLS AND HEIGHTENED CONCERNS OVER PRIVACY AND SAFETY DISCOURAGE MOST PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET FROM EVER SEEKING OUT SUPPORT OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. ETHNOGRAPHY CAN HELP BETTER ILLUSTRATE THE INTERLOCKING FEATURES OF OFFLINE AND DIGITAL INEQUALITIES, SHOWING HOW STATUS-SPECIFIC USES OF SOCIAL PLATFORMS EMERGE AND SHAPE UNEQUAL OUTCOMES OF DIGITAL PARTICIPATION FOR MEMBERS OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES.","UNIV ZURICH, COMMUN & MEDIA RES IKMZ, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.","MARLER, W (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZURICH, COMMUN & MEDIA RES IKMZ, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.","ARORA P, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0163443717691225; BARRERA M, 1986, DOI 10.1007/bf00922627; BIRNHOLTZ J, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2056305120913995; BORST I, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817694599; BOURDIEU P, 2001; BUENTE W, 2020; BURKE M, 2011; BURKE M, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12162; BURRELL J, 2012; CHARMAZ K, 2006; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; DESMOND M, 2012, DOI 10.1086/663574; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DIMAGGIO P, 2012, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102545; DUFFY B, 2017; ELLISON N, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; ELLISON N, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12078; ELLISON N, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810385389; FRITZ N, 2018; GONZALES A, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0093650214565925; HAMMOND S, 2018, DOI 10.1093/bjsw/bcx144; HARGITTAI E, 2019, DOI 10.1093/oso/9780198843498.003.0007; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HOFFMANN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816660784; HUI JULIE S, 2012; IGNATOW G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1301519; KATZ M, 1989; KRIGE D, 2012, DOI 10.1017/s0001972011000738; LANE J, 2018; LI X, 2018; LI X, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.066; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MARLER W, 2020; MESCH G, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0093650211398865; PARHANKANGAS A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusvent.2016.11.001; PUTNAM ROBERT D, 2000; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; RANGASWAMY N, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1367877915576538; RICKMAN A, 2018; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SNOW D, 1993; SOBIERAJ S, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1348535; SOLOMON S, 2007; STRUTZEL E, 1968; STUART F, 2020; TREPTE S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/15213269.2013.838904; UTZ S, 2017, DOI 10.1027/1864-1105/a000222; VALENZUELA S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; WACQUANT L, 2005; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",2,2021,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000753587200006,ISI,UNIV ZURICH,UNIV ZURICH,NA,"MARLER W, 2021, J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMMUN","MARLER W, 2021, J COMPUT-MEDIAT COMMUN",SWITZERLAND,10.1093/jcmc/zmab020,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,NA,WOS

THIS DIVIDE IS THE RESULT OF MULTIPLE MARKET FAILURES IN BOTH THE DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF BROADBAND ACCESS, WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THROUGH PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND COMMUNITY-LED INITIATIVES. BASED ON INTERVIEWS AND ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER EXPLORES HOW COMMUNITY NETWORKS AND PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO PROMOTING THE DELIVERY AND ADOPTION OF SUPERFAST BROADBAND ACROSS THE RURAL UK. THE CASE STUDY ANALYSIS COMPARES THE OUTCOMES OF EACH MODEL, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. ALTHOUGH EXPANDING THE COVERAGE OF SUPERFAST BROADBAND ACROSS THE COUNTY, THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP DID NOT SOLVE THE ACCESS DIVIDE AFFLICTING THE HARDEST-TO-REACH AREAS. SOME OF THE LATTER WERE SERVED BY THE COMMUNITY NETWORK, WHICH RELIED ON VOLUNTEERS AND DEMAND AGGREGATION TO REDUCE THE COST OF FIBRE ROLLOUT. THE SCALABILITY OF THIS APPROACH, HOWEVER, HAS YET TO BE DEMONSTRATED. ON THE DEMAND SIDE, BOTH INITIATIVES ACHIEVED A HIGH TAKE-UP PROVING THAT THE RURAL 'ADOPTION' DIVIDE HAS DECREASED OVER THE YEARS.

THE STUDY CONSIDERS 41 COUNTRIES IN THE REGION WHICH ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY LINKED, AND IT ALLOWS FOR SPATIAL INTERDEPENDENCE. IT ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH AFFECT ICT ACCESS AND USE. GLOBALLY, ABOUT HALF OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET WHEREAS THE REMAINING HALF, I.E. ABOUT 3.8 BILLION PEOPLE, ARE NOT (YET) CONNECTED. THE PROBLEM IS MORE SEVERE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES COMPARED TO DEVELOPED COUNTRIES; IT IS SAID TO BE UNSATISFACTORY IN SSA COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES. WE APPLY A SPATIAL PANEL ANALYSIS USING THE SPATIAL DURBIN MODEL (SDM) SPECIFICATIONS FOR 451 OBSERVATIONS FROM 2006 TO 2016. OUR ESTIMATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE IS A STRONG SPATIAL INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG SSA, IMPLYING THAT INTERNET ACCESS AND BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS IN ONE COUNTRY ARE AFFECTED BY INTERNET ACCESS AND BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, MOST LIKELY DUE TO SPILLOVER EFFECTS. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT GDP PER CAPITA, GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY EFFICACY AND ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE DIRECTLY AFFECT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. MOREOVER, GDP PER CAPITA, POPULATION GROWTH, GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION, TRADE OPENNESS, AND ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THROUGH SPILLOVER EFFECTS. REGARDING POLICY IMPLICATIONS WE SUGGEST THAT SSA GOVERNMENTS SHOULD WORK CLOSER TOGETHER IN ENSURING INTERNET OPENNESS AND TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THEIR COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO ENSURE DIGITAL INCLUSION IN THEIR COUNTRIES.","UNIV DODOMA, DEPT ECON, DODOMA, TANZANIA.;  EGE UNIV, FAC ECON & ADM SCI, IZMIR, TURKEY.;  HEINRICH HEINE UNIV DUSSELDORF, DUSSELDORF INST COMPETIT ECON DICE, DUSSELDORF, GERMANY.","KARACUKA, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), EGE UNIV, FAC ECON & ADM SCI, IZMIR, TURKEY.","ANGELIDES M, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0268-4012(97)00024-8; ANSELIN L, 1998; BAGCHI K, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2005.10856402; BARBERO J, 2018, DOI 10.1111/twec.12723; BILLON M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/09654310701748009; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2257.2008.00461.x; BIRBA O, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.strueco.2012.06.003; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BUYS P, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.01.011; CAPPELLI P, 2001; CARBONI O, 2013; CAREY J W, 2008; CARSON A, 2013; CASELLI F, 2001, DOI 10.1257/aer.91.2.328; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; CHOWDARY T H, 2002, DOI 10.1108/14636690210453361; CORROCHER N, 2002, DOI 10.1080/02683960210132061; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; CZERNICH N, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2011.02420.x; DASGUPTA S, 2005, DOI 10.1080/13600810500137889; DEWAN S, 2005; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; DING L, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s00168-007-0188-5; DOLOREUX D, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0160-791x(02)00007-6; DOLOREUX D, 2012, DOI 10.1093/jeg/lbr003; EASTIN M, 2015, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2015.1054994; ELHORST J, 2010, DOI 10.1080/17421770903541772; ELHORST J, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-40340-8; FALCH M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.004; FALCH M, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2007.01.008; FEIJOO C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.11.001; GHOBADI S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2013.833292; HAUCAP J, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10272-019-0825-0; HOWARD P, 2010; JING Z, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s00181-017-1249-y; KOLENDA R, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9906.2011.00593.x; KRAEMAR K, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00071; LESAGE J, 2010; LESAGE J, 2009; LIN C, 2016; LIU C, 2013, DOI 10.1111/grow.12023; MALECKI E, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0743-0167(02)00068-2; MARTIN B, 2011; MOSHI G, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.07.005; MUTSVAIRO B, 2019, DOI 10.5117/9789462986855_ch01; MUTULA S, 2005, DOI 10.1108/00330330510595706; MYOVELLA G, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2019.101856; NISHIJIMA M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.10.004; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1108/146366903322008287; OECD, 2020; OTIOMA C, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10708-018-9882-3; OYELARAN-OYEYINKA B, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0166-4972(02)00170-0; OYELARAN-OYEYINKA B, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.05.002; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; PENARD T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2015.03.004; PICK J, 2016, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2016.484; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; RALLET A, 1998; ROMER P, 1990, DOI 10.1086/261725; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; ROSENBERG N, 1972, DOI 10.1016/0014-4983(72)90001-0; RYE S, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10708-008-9154-8; SARKAR A, 2015; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHUMPETER J, 1943; SHARMA V, 2011, DOI 10.1177/097324701100700113; SIRIGINIDI SUBBA R, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2005.01.007; SKALETSKY M, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2016.1134171; SUJARWOTO S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.08.008; SZELES M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.007; TIENTAO A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.inteco.2015.04.004; UNCTAD, 2019; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.171; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WARF B, 2013; WARREN M, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.001; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WORLD B, 2019; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1108/itp-01-2013-0022",4,2021,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000710770700003,ISI,UNIV DODOMA;EGE UNIV;HEINRICH HEINE UNIV DUSSELDORF,EGE UNIV,NA,"MYOVELLA G, 2021, TELECOMMUN POLICY","MYOVELLA G, 2021, TELECOMMUN POLICY",GERMANY;TANZANIA;TURKEY,10.1016/j.telpol.2021.102224,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,NA,WOS

THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT SIZE OF MUNICI-PALITY, AGE AND EDUCATION AFFECT THE INTENTION TO EMIGRATE. IT IS FOUND THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF ICT ACCESS HAS NOT, IN MANY CASES, BEEN OVERCOME, HAVING AN EFFECT ON CITIZEN SATISFACTION.

WE PROPOSE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DIGITAL MOBILITY INDEX, QUANTIFIED BY MEASURING THE USAGE TYPOLOGY IN WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY IS EMPLOYED TO ENABLE MOBILITY. THROUGH A DIGITAL PERSPECTIVE ON MOBILITIES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INVESTIGATE HOW EMBODIED PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES OF DIFFERENT MODES OF PHYSICAL OR VIRTUAL DISPLACEMENTS ARE FACILITATED AND EMERGE THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES. THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGIES IN FACILITATING THE ANCHORING OF MOBILITIES, TRANSPORTING THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE FLOW OF GOODS, AND IN MEDIATING SOCIAL RELATIONS THROUGH SPACE AND TIME IS EMPHASIZED THROUGH ANALYSIS OF HOW DIGITAL USAGE CAN REPRODUCE MODELS TYPICAL OF THE NEOLIBERAL CITY, THE EFFECTS OF WHICH IN TERMS OF SPATIAL (IN)JUSTICE HAVE BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN THE LITERATURE. THE POLARIZATION INHERENT TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY A SEPARATION BETWEEN WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE ""SPACE OF FLOWS "" (WELL CONNECTED, MOBILE, AND OFFERING MORE OPPORTUNITIES) AND THE ""SPACE OF PLACES "" (POORLY CONNECTED, FIXED, AND ISOLATED).

J. EDUC. SOC. TECHNOL. SCI.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; COVID-19; EDUCATION; PERCEPTION; BLENDED LEARNING,EDUCATION; SATISFACTION; DEFINITION; DIVIDE,"ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISRUPTIVE NATURE OF THE COVID-19 DISEASE, THE PRESENT PAPER AIMS TO ANALYZE THE MAIN REPERCUSSIONS OF THE PANDEMIC FOR THE FIELD OF EDUCATION. THE OBJECTIVE IS TWOFOLD: (1) TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESS OF DIGITALIZATION AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, (2) TO ANALYZE STUDENTS' INSIGHTS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HYBRID METHODOLOGIES OF LEARNING AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTION ACROSS UNIVERSITY DEGREES. A STRUCTURED LITERATURE REVIEW ON THE RESONANCE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR EDUCATION IS PERFORMED. FROM THIS, THE CONCEPT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS RISEN TO PROMINENCE, AS EDUCATION DIGITALIZATION HAS MANAGED TO BROADEN GLOBAL SOCIAL INEQUALITIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PREVAILING E-LEARNING METHODOLOGIES ARE DETAILED, OUTLINING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASYNCHRONOUS AND SYNCHRONOUS FORMAT. THE TOPIC OF BLENDED LEARNING IS PUT FORWARD, DETAILING THE DIVERSE HYBRID EDUCATION MODELS PRESENT IN THE ACTUAL PARADIGM OF EDUCATION. IN ORDER TO ANALYZE AND MEASURE THE PERCEPTION OF STUDENTS REGARDING EDUCATION DIGITALIZATION, A SURVEY BASED ON VALIDATED SCALES IS CONDUCTED AMONG 305 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN SPAIN. A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE MOST FREQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED TEACHING MODEL WITHIN THE COVID-19 SCENARIO IS THE MIXTURE OF IN-PERSON AND SYNCHRONOUS REMOTE LESSONS. IN ADDITION TO THIS, OVERALL SATISFACTION, PERCEPTION OF WORKLOAD AND CONFIDENCE IN THE PROFESSIONAL FUTURE DIFFERS ACROSS BRANCHES OF STUDY. FINALLY, SEVERAL IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATIONAL FRAMEWORK ARE PRESENTED.","ESIC UNIV, CAMINO VALDENIGRALES S-N, POZUELO DE ALARCON 28223, SPAIN.","ERDMANN, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ESIC UNIV, CAMINO VALDENIGRALES S-N, POZUELO DE ALARCON 28223, SPAIN.","ADEDOYIN O, 2020, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2020.1813180; ALI D W, 2020; BANCO M, 2020; BERNAL L, 2012; BICEN H, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2012.682586; BRACKEN C, 2005, DOI 10.1207/s1532785xmep0702_4; BRUNER G C, 2015; CAMBRIDGE, 2020; CHAE B, 2013, DOI 10.1086/670393; CLIFFORD T, 2020; CRAWFORD B, 2021; CRONJE J, 2020, DOI 10.34190/ejel.20.18.2.001; CROSBY L, 1987, DOI 10.1177/002224378702400408; DECUYPERE M, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1474904118814141; DOWNES S, 2005; ERDMANN A, 2019, DOI 10.4995/muse.2019.11869; ESCUELA ANDALUZA DE SALUD P, 2020; FIELDING H, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.compcom.2016.03.002; GARCIA ARETIO P D L, 2002; GARCIA J, 2004; HALILI S, 2021, DOI 10.4995/muse.2021.14768; HILTON J, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s11423-016-9434-9; HILTON J, 2012, DOI 10.1080/02680513.2012.716657; HRASTINSKI S, 2008; HRASTINSKI S, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s11528-019-00375-5; HUGHES A, 2014; JAMES G, 2002; KEENGWE J, 2010; RODICIO-GARCIA M, 2020, DOI 10.15366/riejs2020.9.3.006; MONTENEGRO S, 2020, DOI 10.15366/riejs2020.9.3.017; NOBRE A, 2018, DOI 10.4018/978-1-5225-5011-2.ch001; NUNEZ-CANAL M, 2021, DOI 10.13140/rg.2.2.34706.89289; OECD, 2021, DOI 10.1787/34bfd999-en; PECO P P, 2014; PLENA I, 2020; SAHU P, 2020, DOI 10.7759/cureus.7541; SAVE THE C, 2015; SAVE THE C, 2020; SHAFIQ M N, 2010; SIEMENS G, 2013; STAKER H, 2012; STATISTA, 2020; STATISTA, 2020; TANG H, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11423-020-09879-x; UNESCO, 2020; UNICEF, 2020; UNIVERSIDAD DEL PAIS V, 2021; WHITE A, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jretai.2012.01.005; WORLD B, 2020; WORLD B, 2020; WORLD B, 2020; WORLD ECONOMIC F, 2018",4,2021,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000704916100002,ISI,ESIC UNIV,ESIC UNIV,NA,"ERDMANN A, 2021, MULTIDISCIP J EDUC SOC TECHNOL SCI","ERDMANN A, 2021, MULTIDISCIP J EDUC SOC TECHNOL SCI",SPAIN,10.4995/muse.2021.16007,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,4,"UNIV POLITECNICA VALENCIA, EDITORIAL UPV",NA,WOS

THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH CURRENT AND FORMER WOMEN EDITORS, OUR RESEARCH OFFERS A CLOSER LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EDITING PRACTICES ON THE SPANISH WIKIPEDIA: THE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL CONTEXTS THAT PROMPT WOMEN TO START OR STOP EDITING; THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE TREATMENT OF GENDER EQUALITY IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA; AND THEIR FEELINGS ABOUT TAKING PART IN THE CREATION OF CONTENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN A MINORITY. SELF-ORGANIZED EVENTS KNOWN AS EDIT-A-THONS (IN SPANISH, WIKIQUEDADAS), WHERE WOMEN MEET TO DISCUSS AND SHARE EDITING PRACTICES, HAVE EMERGED AS SELF-INCLUSION STRATEGIES TO ENABLE MORE WOMEN TO ENTER, REMAIN, AND BE RECOGNIZED IN THIS MALE-DOMINATED EDITING ENVIRONMENT.

LACK OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES OR DIFFICULTY USING THE PLATFORM DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ASPECTS THAT NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN THE EDITING PROCESS, THOUGH TIME SPENT ON UNPAID CARE WORK DOES SEEM TO BE A CRITICAL FACTOR.","UNIV BARCELONA, FAC INFORMACIO & MITJANS AUDIOVISUALS, CTR RECERCA INFORMACIO COMUNICACIO & CULTURA, MELCIOR DE PALAU 140, BARCELONA 08014, SPAIN.;  UNIV INT VALENCIA, FAC ARTES HUMANIDADES & COMUNICAC, PINTOR SOROLLA 21, VALENCIA 46002, SPAIN.;  UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA, ESTUDIOS INFORMAT MULTIMEDIA & TELECOMUNICAC, RAMBLA POBLENOU 156, BARCELONA 08018, SPAIN.;  UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA, ESTUDIOS PSICOL & CIENCIAS EDUC, RAMBLA POBLENOU 156, BARCELONA 08018, SPAIN.","FERRAN-FERRER, N (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV BARCELONA, FAC INFORMACIO & MITJANS AUDIOVISUALS, CTR RECERCA INFORMACIO COMUNICACIO & CULTURA, MELCIOR DE PALAU 140, BARCELONA 08014, SPAIN.","AIBAR E, 2015, DOI 10.1108/el-12-2013-0217; AIKHENVALD A, 2016; ANTIN J, 2011, DOI 10.1145/2038558.2038561; ARENDT H, 1974; BEAMAN L, 2012, DOI 10.1126/science.1212382; BENHABIB S, 1992; BENKLER Y, 2007; BRAILAS A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.lcsi.2015.07.002; CALLAHAN E, 2011, DOI 10.1002/asi.21577; CASTANO-COLLADO C, 2012; CASTELLS M, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0002716207311877; CLUA A, 2018, DOI 10.3916/c55-2018-05; DAWE L, 2017, DOI 10.1108/ils-09-2016-0067; DEAN J, 2007; ESTEBAN O, 2017; FORTUNATI L, 2004; GARDNER S, 2011; GAUTHIER M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/14791420.2017.1386321; GLISCZINSKI D, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1541344618777367; GLOTT R, 2010; GRIZZLE A, 2012; GUERRA-PALMERO M, 2019; HABERMAS J, 1974, DOI 10.2307/487737; HACHE A, 2011; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.957711; HECHT B, 2010; HILL B, 2013, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0065782; HINNOSAAR M, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jebo.2019.04.020; HOOD N, 2018; KENNEDY T, 2003; KING N, 2019; KONIECZNY P, 2016, DOI 10.1002/asi.23616; KRIPPENDORF K, 1990; KVALE S, 2009; LAM S, 2011, DOI 10.1145/2038558.2038560; LANDES J, 1992; LEWIS M, 2020, DOI 10.1038/s41562-020-0918-6; LIH A, 2009; MACAULAY M, 2016, DOI 10.7264/n36m3541; MASSA P, 2014; MENKING A, 2019, DOI 10.1145/3290605.3300702; MINGUILLON J, 2021, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0246702; MIQUEL-RIBE M, 2018, DOI 10.3389/fphy.2018.00054; MOUFFE C, 2000; NEUENDORF K, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11199-010-9893-0; O'BRIEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0163443714544868; PADOVANI, 2019; PATEMAN C, 1988; PROTONOTARIOS I, 2016; RICHTERICH A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2018.1486867; ROMMES E, 2004; ROSS B, 2018; SELWYN N, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.08.004; SICHLER A, 2014; SINGER P, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3038912.3052716; SLEVIN J, 2000; SOLER-ADILLON J, 2018, DOI 10.3916/c54-2018-04; VAN DIJK J, 2012; VAZQUEZ S, 2011; VEGA-MONTIEL A, 2018; BOSCH N, 2012; WAGNER C, 2016, DOI 10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4; WIKIMEDIA F, 2011; WIKIMEDIA F, 2020; WIKIMEDIA F, 2020; WILLIAMS, 2014; YOUNG I, 1989, DOI 10.1086/293065",0,2021,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000708225900005,ISI,UNIV BARCELONA;UNIV INT VALENCIA;UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA;UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA,UNIV BARCELONA,NA,"FERRAN-FERRER N, 2021, PROF INF","FERRAN-FERRER N, 2021, PROF INF",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.3145/epi.2021.sep.16,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,0, EDICIONES PROFESIONALES INFORMACION SL-EPI,NA,WOS

WE HAVE EXPLORED AND ANALYSED THE PROCESS OF ADAPTATION TO THE EDUCATIONAL MODEL BY THE STUDENT BODY, AND THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH THE PEDAGOGICAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ELEMENTS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THEIR LEARNING. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS ARE USED TO GATHER AND ANALYSE THE DATA. FROM 1715 STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY AND THE PERCEPTIONS OF 30 STUDENTS INDIVIDUALLY INTERVIEWED, THE RESULTS SHOW POSITIVE EVALUATIONS REGARDING THE INTEGRATION AND ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL COMPETENCIES, AND ALSO, THAT THE ONLINE EDUCATION GENERALLY SERVES AS A RESPONSIVE MODEL TO THE EMERGENT NEEDS OF THE LEARNER.

LEARNING FROM OUR STUDENTS' EXPERIENCE DURING THIS PERIOD WILL HELP US SHAPE FUTURE HYBRID DELIVERY SO THAT IT BEST FITS BIOSCIENCE STUDENTS. THIS PEDAGOGICAL STUDY EXPLORED ASTON UNIVERSITY'S BIOSCIENCE STUDENTS' EXPERIENCES OF STUDYING FROM HOME, AND THE IMPACT OF THE LOCKDOWN ON MENTAL WELLBEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. 151 STUDENTS COMPLETED AN ONLINE SURVEY DURING AUGUST 2020, WHICH INCLUDED OPEN AND CLOSED QUESTIONS. ANALYSIS OF SURVEY DATA REVEALED THAT A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS REPORTED POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF ONLINE OPEN-BOOK ASSESSMENTS AND MOST WOULD WELCOME THIS FORMAT IN THE FUTURE. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS FACED NO TECHNICAL ISSUES, PREDOMINANTLY STATING THAT THEY ALSO HAD GOOD INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. SHIFTING TO REMOTE LEARNING AND ONLINE CLASSROOMS UNCOVERED CONFLICTING PREFERENCES; DESPITE WANTING MORE INTERACTIVE LECTURES, ONLY HALF OF THE STUDENTS WERE COMFORTABLE INTERACTING USING VIDEO CAMERAS. FREE TEXT RESPONSES PROVIDED AN INSIGHT INTO HOW SOME STUDENTS REPORTED AN INADEQUATE HOME WORKING SPACE/ENVIRONMENT AND LACKED NECESSARY ITEMS SUCH AS A DESK, HIGHLIGHTING HOW REMOTE WORKING MAY INTENSIFY SOCIAL AND DIGITAL INEQUALITY - PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS FROM MORE DEPRIVED HOUSEHOLDS. WIDER DETRIMENTAL EXPERIENCES OF LOCKDOWN INCLUDED DISSATISFACTION WITH ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, DECREASED CONCENTRATION, SLEEPING DIFFICULTIES AND A DECLINE IN MENTAL WELLBEING. EDUCATION STRATEGIES GOING FORWARD WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED DURING THE PANDEMIC. OUR UNIVERSITY, AMONGST OTHERS, IS EMBRACING HYBRID COURSE DELIVERY, WHICH COULD OFFER A SOLUTION TO ENSURING BIOSCIENCE STUDENTS RECEIVE HANDS-ON LABORATORY EXPERIENCE AND FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT TO REMAIN MOTIVATED AND BENEFIT FROM THE ON-CAMPUS FACILITIES AND SUPPORT, WHILST ALLOWING STUDENTS SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY AFFORDED BY REMOTE STUDY.

THE SAMPLE WAS SELECTED ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ONLINE JOURNALS IN THE FARMING SECTOR AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. FROM THE CENSUS, WE CHOSE THOSE FARMS CONSIDERED MOST REPRESENTATIVE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE MAIN CRITERIA: THE LEVEL OF PAC (COMMON AGRARIAN POLITICS) SUBSIDIES AND MILK PRODUCTION (LITRES/COW AND YEAR). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE FARMERS USED THE INTERNET, BUT ON MANY AN OCCASION, THEY WERE DISCONTENTED IN RELATION TO THE POOR CONNECTION QUALITY IN THEIR FARMS. IN REGARD TO THE USE OF THE ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT FOR PROCEDURES RELATED TO THEIR FARMS, MANY OF THEM WERE ABLE TO PERFORM THEM THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE; HOWEVER, THERE WERE PROCEDURES WHICH THE USERS DEFINED AS ""COMPLEX"" AND WHICH HAD TO BE OUTSOURCED TO AUTHORISED ENTITIES. THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE FARMERS DO WANT TO EMPLOY THE E-GOVERNMENT, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND COST SAVING; HOWEVER, THE CURRENT WEB PAGES DO NOT MEET THE USERS' EXPECTATIONS. FINALLY, THIS SITUATION, APPLIED TO A REGION PLACED AMONG THE 10 MOST PRODUCTIVE REGIONS OF MILK, IS COMPARABLE TO WHAT HAPPENS IN OTHER REGIONS.","UNIV SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, ESCOLA POLITECN SUPER, GRP INVEST PROEPLA, CAMPUS UNIV S-N, LUGO 27002, SPAIN.","VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, ESCOLA POLITECN SUPER, GRP INVEST PROEPLA, CAMPUS UNIV S-N, LUGO 27002, SPAIN.","BERTON M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102806; BRONSON K, 2018, DOI 10.22215/timreview/1135; BUCCI G, 2019; BUGUEIRO A, 2019, DOI 10.1017/s1751731118002896; BUTLER D, 2016, DOI 10.1111/soru.12103; CAJA G, 2016, DOI 10.1017/s0022029916000261; CASTRO A, 2015, DOI 10.4081/ijas.2015.3559; CLAY N, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s13280-019-01177-y; COBLE K, 2018, DOI 10.1093/aepp/ppx056; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12154; COSTA C, 2019; DAVIDSON C, 2020, DOI 10.1163/15691497-12341547; DEMIRDOVEN B, 2020, DOI 10.1145/3428502.3428549; DIEZ-OLIVAN A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.inffus.2018.10.005; DJAMBA Y, 2002, DOI 10.2307/3211488; EASTWOOD C, 2017, DOI 10.1071/an16465; EITZINGER A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2019.01.049; EUROPEAN C, 2010; FAAEQ M, 2019, DOI 10.1504/eg.2019.10016168; FREEMAN J, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1623901; GALINDO-PEREZ-DE-AZPILLAGA L, 2018, DOI 10.1080/23311886.2018.1528730; GARGIULO J, 2018, DOI 10.3168/jds.2017-13324; GONZALEZ-MEJIA A, 2018, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0195286; GULATEE Y, 2020, DOI 10.1145/3428502.3428574; HARDY J, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3272973.3273008; HENNESSY T, 2016, DOI 10.1093/aepp/ppw015; HYLAND J, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.07.006; INKINEN T, 2018, DOI 10.1080/09654313.2018.1448756; JACOB D, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0020852319861895; JAKKU E, 2018; JANC K, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.njas.2019.100309; JAYARAMAN P, 2016, DOI 10.3390/s16111884; KUHL S, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1828051x.2019.1691064; KULATUNGA C, 2017, DOI 10.1109/mitp.2017.28; LAPPLE D, 2019, DOI 10.1111/1477-9552.12282; MACFARLAND T W, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-30634-6_4; MAGNUSSON D, 2019, DOI 10.1080/00291951.2019.1596153; MCKILLOP J, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1389224x.2018.1432494; MEAD R, 2017; MENSAH I, 2020, DOI 10.4018/ijswis.2020070103; MENSAH I, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2158244020933593; MENSAH I, 2020, DOI 10.1080/01900692.2019.1645687; MERGEL I, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2019.06.002; METHORST R, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0269094216655520; MICHELS M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11119-019-09675-5; MICHELS M, 2019, DOI 10.3168/jds.2019-16489; MULLA D, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2012.08.009; NARANJO-ZOLOTOV M, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2019.05.009; O'DONOGHUE C, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10961-016-9529-9; O'GRADY M J, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.inpa.2017.05.001; PAPPA I, 2019; PARK S, 2019, DOI 10.1080/22041451.2019.1601493; PAVEZ I, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2017.06.001; PEREIRA A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.127; PHILIP L, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.12.002; PRICE L, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0269094218791508; ROBERTS E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.03.001; ROMERA A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102818; SAAVEDRA-NIEVES A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2020.02.013; SALEMINK K, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0269094216670940; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SALEMINK K, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0308518x16636639; SALMON G, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.gfs.2018.04.002; SAWALHA S, 2019, DOI 10.1504/eg.2019.096573; SHADBOLT N, 2016; STOCKER V, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2019.04.007; TIWARI S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.01.029; LOPEZ E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.06.043; TOWNSEND L, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.09.001; TOWNSEND L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/14702541.2014.978807; TRISTE L, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11625-018-0554-5; TUCCI C, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10660-015-9195-2; TWIZEYIMANA J, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2019.01.001; TZOUNIS A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2017.09.007; VAN AERSCHOT L, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13511610802576927; VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ A, 2021; VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ A, 2021, DOI 10.3390/fi13040099; VERHEES F, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1828051x.2017.1422154; WALTER A, 2017, DOI 10.1073/pnas.1707462114; WARF B, 2019, DOI 10.1080/00221341.2018.1518990; WEISSENSTEINER R, 2018; WOLFERT S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023; YOUNG J, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.07.001; ZAMBON I, 2019, DOI 10.3390/pr7010036; ZAMORA-IZQUIERDO M, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2018.10.014; ZHANG B, 2021, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2020.1743361",3,2021,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000689064300001,ISI,UNIV SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,UNIV SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,NA,"VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ A, 2021, FUTURE INTERNET","VAZQUEZ-LOPEZ A, 2021, FUTURE INTERNET",SPAIN,10.3390/fi13080206,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS",3,MDPI,GALICIAN GOVERNMENT (XUNTA DE GALICIA) [ED431C-2021-27],WOS
LEGUINA A; MIHELJ S; DOWNEY J,PUBLIC LIBRARIES AS RESERVES OF CULTURAL AND DIGITAL CAPITAL: ADDRESSING INEQUALITY THROUGH DIGITALIZATION,LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,LIBR. INFOR. SCI. RES.,ARTICLE,CULTURAL CAPITAL; DIGITAL CAPITAL; DIGITAL DIVIDE; PUBLIC LIBRARIES; INTERNET,PREFERENCES; VOLUNTEERS; ATTAINMENT; LITERACY; GENDER; AGE,"PUBLIC LIBRARIES ARE AMONG KEY SITES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CULTURAL CAPITAL, AND POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST POTENT MEANS THROUGH WHICH THE STATE CAN ADDRESS INEQUALITY. WHILE DIGITALIZATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES ALREADY ATTRACTED SIGNIFICANT SCHOLARLY ATTENTION, THE EVIDENCE OF ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE ACQUISITION OF CULTURAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE AND SOCIAL MOBILITY REMAINS LIMITED, AS DOES THE CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF LINKS BETWEEN DIGITALIZATION, CULTURAL CAPITAL, AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON TWO DISCONNECTED BODIES OF RESEARCH, THE SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CULTURAL CAPITAL AND STRATIFICATION AND RESEARCH ON DIGITAL DIVIDES. TO BRIDGE THESE TWO BODIES OF RESEARCH, THE INTERPLAY OF CULTURAL AND DIGITAL CAPITAL IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES WAS INVESTIGATED. THE EXTENSIVE DATASET FROM THE UK TAKING PART SURVEY (2016-17) WAS ANALYZED USING TWO-STEP CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION MODELS TO EXPLORE THE CONTRASTING PROFILES OF CONTEMPORARY LIBRARY USERS. RESULTS IDENTIFY FOUR DISTINCT USER GROUPS: TRADITIONAL, ACTIVE, FAMILY, AND TECH ACCESS, WHICH POSSESS DIFFERENT DEGREES OF CULTURAL AND DIGITAL CAPITAL, HAVE DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILES, AND BENEFIT FROM DIGITALIZED LIBRARIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. IF LIBRARIES ARE TO FULFIL THEIR ROLE IN REDUCING SOCIAL INEQUALITIES, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY TAILOR THEIR DIGITAL SERVICES TO THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH USER GROUP.

EDUC.,ARTICLE,COVID-19; LEARNING GAP; DIGITAL GAP; SCHOOL GAP; DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS; EDUCATIONAL EQUITY; SCHOOL CLOSURE; CONFINEMENT,NA,"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH BROUGHT WITH IT A LONG PERIOD OF CONFINEMENT AND SCHOOL CLOSURES, HAS DEALT A SEVERE BLOW TO MANY VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THESE STUDENTS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY KEEPING UP WITH SCHOOL AT HOME FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING PEDAGOGICAL, ECONOMIC AND/OR CULTURAL ONES. FOR THIS REASON, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DECIPHER AND ANALYZE THE IMPACT AND REALITY OF THE THREE EDUCATIONAL GAPS GENERATED BY THE COVID-19: THE LEARNING GAP, THE DIGITAL GAP AND THE SCHOOL GAP, IN ORDER TO LATER DEVELOP A SERIES OF EDUCATIONAL PROPOSALS TO RE-ESTABLISH EQUITY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THE LOSS OF LEARNING, THE FAILURE TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN BASIC SKILLS, THE DETACHMENT FROM SCHOOL AND EDUCATION, THE INCREASE IN THE DROPOUT RATE, EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS,... ARE SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT STUDENTS HAVE SUFFERED AND ARE SUFFERING. THESE CONSEQUENCES HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY AFFECTED THE MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS, INCREASING THE INEQUITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THEREFORE, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EDUCATIONAL POLICIES AIMED AT MITIGATING THESE CONSEQUENCES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES TO REENGAGE STUDENTS IN LEARNING, SUCH AS: MODIFYING THE CURRICULUM - MAKING IT MORE FLEXIBLE -; DEVELOPING MORE MOTIVATING METHODOLOGIES; ESTABLISHING PERSONALIZED TEACHING; PROMOTING COMMUNICATION AND CO-RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN FAMILY AND SCHOOL; IMPLEMENTING EMOTIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS; MONITORING EDUCATIONAL ABANDONMENT AND TACKLING ITS CAUSES,..., ARE ESSENTIAL. THE ROLE OF THE TEACHERS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, AS WELL AS THEIR PERSONAL QUALITIES AND THEIR PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH. LEARNING FROM THE MISTAKES MADE IS A NECESSITY, SINCE NEW PERIODS OF CONFINEMENT CANNOT BE RULED OUT IN THE COMING YEARS.","UNIV CATOLICA VALENCIA, VALENCIA, SPAIN.","PONCE, JRS (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CATOLICA VALENCIA, VALENCIA, SPAIN.","BABINCAKOVA M, 2020, DOI 10.1021/acs.jchemed.0c00748; BARRIENTOS-FERNANDEZ A, 2020, DOI 10.15581/004.38.59-78; BAUMAN Z, 2017; BEAUDOIN, 2013, DOI n, 2013; BROOKS S, 2020, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30460-8; CABELLO R, 2010; CABRERA L, 2020, DOI 10.7203/rase.13.2.17125; CACERES-MUNOZ J, 2020, DOI 10.15366/riejs2020.9.3.011; DAY C, 2015; DAY C, 2019; DE ALBA A, 2020; FERNANDEZ M, 2020; FERNANDEZ N G, 2020; GARCIA-GONZALEZ A J, 2019, DOI 10.14201/teri.20313; GORTAZAR L, 2020; HATTIE J, 2017; JORDAN J A, 2019, DOI 10.15581/004.36.31-51; KAUR D B, 2020, DOI 10.22158/wjeh.v2n4p6; LOPEZMARTIN R, 2020, DOI 10.15366/riejs2020.9.3.007; RODICIO-GARCIA M, 2020, DOI 10.15366/riejs2020.9.3.006; MARSHALL D, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0031721720970702; MEIRIEU P, 2019; MEIRIEU P, 2016; PERRENOUD P, 2012; PLA S, 2020; REIMERS F, 2020; ROGERS H, 2020; SANTED, 2020; SANZ R, 2020; SAVE THE C, 2020; SERRANO-SARMIENTO A, 2017, DOI 10.14201/teoredu292167184; UNESCO, 2020; UNICEF, 2020; VALIENTE-BARROSO C, 2020, DOI 10.5209/rced.63480; WYSE A, 2020, DOI 10.1111/emip.12357; ZUBILLAGA A, 2020",0,2021,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000659193200008,ISI,UNIV CATOLICA VALENCIA,UNIV CATOLICA VALENCIA,NA,"PONCE JRS, 2021, TEOR EDUC","PONCE JRS, 2021, TEOR EDUC",SPAIN,10.14201/teri.25471,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,EDICIONES UNIV SALAMANCA,NA,WOS

HOWEVER, DIGITAL DIVIDE, DECLINING TRUST IN TECHNOLOGY, AND LOW IT/IS ADOPTION RATES BY PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES ARE IMPORTANT CHALLENGES FOR SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO CITIZENS. PREVIOUS STUDIES IN THE AREA OF IT/IS ADOPTION AND E-GOVERNMENT HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON CITIZENS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES IT/IS ADOPTION BY EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN CITIZENS AND THE FOCUS IS ON NON-MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. A RESEARCH MODEL HAS BEEN PROPOSED BASED ON THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR (TPB) AND TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (TAM) WHICH HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO INCLUDE DIGITAL DIVIDE RELATED CONSTRUCTS AND TRUST IN TECHNOLOGY. TO TEST THE PROPOSED MODEL, A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG EARLY ADOPTERS OF OFFICE 365 AT ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (IDOT) IN SPRINGFIELD AND CHICAGO. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO RESEARCH ON IT/IS ADOPTION IN PUBLIC SECTOR. THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE INSIGHTFUL DESIGN AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL IT/IS DEPLOYMENT IN PUBLIC SECTOR.","NEOMA BUSINESS SCH, MONT ST AIGNAN, FRANCE.;  UNIV ILLINOIS, MIS, SPRINGFIELD, IL USA.;  UNIV ILLINOIS, SPRINGFIELD, IL USA.","GHOLAMI, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NEOMA BUSINESS SCH, MONT ST AIGNAN, FRANCE.","ABDULJALIL K, 2015; AJZEN I, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t; AJZEN I, 1975; AKIYOSHI M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/01972240802356067; ALLAWAY A, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0022-4359(03)00037-x; ATKINSON R, 2011, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1278185; AZUMAH G, 2005, DOI 10.1080/09537280500112439; BAGOZZI R, 1999; BAIRD J E, 2012; BANNISTER F, 2012, DOI 10.2979/eservicej.8.2.3; BASWARE, 2015; BECKER S A, 2003; BELANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; BOSE S, 2007; BYNNER J, 2010; CARTER L, 2008; CARTER L, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9103-6; CAUMONT A, 2013; CHAKRAVORTI B, 2017; CHAN F, 2010; CHEN Q, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.09.001; CLAUDY M, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11747-014-0399-0; CLAUDY M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2010.03.028; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2018, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2018040101; CZAJA S, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.21.2.333; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DAVIS F, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1992.tb00945.x; DELLOITE, 2017; DELOITTE ACCESS E, 2016; ECORYS, 2016; FERRO E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007; FINGER M, 2003; FRAMBACH R, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0148-2963(00)00152-1; GEKARA V, 2019; GORE A, 1997; GRONLUND A, 2005; GUPTA, 2011; GUPTA B, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.004; HAGE E, 2015; HAJKOWICZ S, 2016; HANSEN T, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2004.08.004; HEEKS R, 2008; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; JANOWSKI T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2015.07.001; JANSSEN, 2009; JASIMUDDIN S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/09537287.2017.1375144; KE W, 2004, DOI 10.1145/990680.990687; KIJSANAYOTIN B, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.12.005; KLEIJNEN M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.joep.2009.02.004; LAM J, 2006, DOI 10.2753/mis0742-1222220407; LAMEIJER C S, 2017; LEI Y, 2014, DOI 10.1109/icmecg.2014.69; LI Y, 2017; LIN C, 2003, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2003.tb00296.x; LOPEZ-NICOLAS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2008.05.001; LOWRY D, 2008; LU Y, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.06.002; MADDEN T, 1992, DOI 10.1177/0146167292181001; MCGIVNEY E, 2016; MCKNIGHT D H, 2011, DOI 10.1145/1985347.1985353; MCKNIGHT D, 1998, DOI 10.5465/amr.1998.926622; MCLEOD F, 2009; MONTANO D, 2015; MORTENSON M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.07.007; MOSSBERGER K, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.05.016; NAM T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.09.006; NIEHAVES B, 2014, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2013.19; NISHIDA T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.05.004; OSHLYANSKY L, 2007; OZKAN S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.10.007; PAVLOU P, 2002, DOI 10.5465/apbpp.2002.7517579; PAVLOU P, 2006; PEATTIE K, 2010, DOI 10.1146/annurev-environ-032609-094328; PERRIN A, 2019; PICK J, 2016, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2016.484; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; PONTIGGIA A, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2009.07.001; ROGERS E, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0306-4603(02)00300-3; ROUIBAH K, 2020, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2020070105; SCHAUPP L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2009.12.017; SHETH J, 1981; SHIH C, 2004, DOI 10.1509/jmkg.68.1.59.24029; SHIH Y, 2004, DOI 10.1108/10662240410542643; SHOEMAKER D, 2006; SZMIGIN I, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0166-4972(98)00030-3; TAMS S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2014.10.001; UNPAN, 2010; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2012; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.09.006; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; VENKATESH V, 1996, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-5915.1996.tb01822.x; VENKATESH V, 2016, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00428; VENKATESH V, 2012; WAHID F, 2007; WHETTEN D, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1740-8784.2008.00132.x; WOOKJOON S, 2016, DOI 10.3233/ip-160398; WU J, 2016, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2016070104",6,2021,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000649479400008,ISI,NEOMA BUSINESS SCH;UNIV ILLINOIS;UNIV ILLINOIS,NEOMA BUSINESS SCH,NA,"GHOLAMI R, 2021, J GLOB INF MANAG","GHOLAMI R, 2021, J GLOB INF MANAG",FRANCE;USA;USA,10.4018/jgim.20210701.oa8,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,6,IGI GLOBAL,NA,WOS

HOWEVER, LACK OF INTERNET ACCESS HAS MADE EVIDENT HOW THE HUMAN RIGHT TO EDUCATION, CONSIDERED AN ENABLING ONE, IS AFFECTED FROM NEW DIMENSIONS CREATING A NEED TO CONSIDER NOT ONLY ANALPHABETISM BUT DIGITAL ILLITERACY, AS WELL AS THE DIGITAL GAP IN TERMS OF ACCESS, USE AND COMPETENCE. APPROACHING THESE TWO ASPECTS FROM THEIR OWN COMPLEXITY ALLOWS US PRESENTING THE DIGITAL GAP NOT ONLY AS A CASCADING VULNERABILITY LAYER WHICH AFFECTS THE RIGHT TO EDUCATION, BUT AS AN ISSUE THAT GENERATES AND TRIGGERS OTHER KINDS OF PEDAGOGICAL VULNERABILITIES.

E-COMMERCE IS ONE OF THE SECTORS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. HOWEVER, NOT ALL COUNTRIES HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP E-COMMERCE GROWTH; THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES IN ICT UTILIZATION WORLDWIDE, KNOWN AS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE LEVEL OF DIFFERENCE AMONG EUROPEAN COUNTRIES REGARDING THE E-COMMERCE FUNCTIONALITIES IN THEIR ENTERPRISES USING A CLUSTER ANALYSIS. METHODS/APPROACH: TO ACCOMPLISH THE PAPER GOAL, THE K-MEANS CLUSTER ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON THE EUROSTAT DATA FROM 2019. ENTERPRISES FROM 28 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST IS USED TO EXPLORE IF THE DIFFERENCES AMONG CLUSTERS REGARDING THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT, MEASURED BY THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND SOCIETY INDEX ARE SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: THE INVESTIGATION CONFIRMED THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG EUROPEAN COUNTRIES REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF E-COMMERCE. HOWEVER, A SIMILAR LEVEL OF E-COMMERCE IS NOT RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT. CONCLUSIONS: SINCE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND E-COMMERCE DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IS NOT LINEAR, COUNTRY-LEVEL POLICIES ARE LIKELY TO BE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS DRIVING E-COMMERCE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH LEADS TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THIS ISSUE.","UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ECON & BUSINESS, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ECON & BUSINESS, DEPT INFORMAT, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  UNIV OSIJEK, FAC DENT MED & HLTH, OSIJEK, CROATIA.","JAKOVIC, B (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ECON & BUSINESS, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","AGNIHOTRI R, 2021, DOI 10.4337/9781788975315.00009; AHMAD N, 2019; AKHTER F, 2009; AL-QAISI L, 2015; ALBUQUERQUE A B, 2002; ALNEMR R, 2010, DOI 10.4067/s0718-18762010000200005; AMARO S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2016.03.007; BLANK G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BONGOMIN O, 2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/4280156; BRYNJOLFSSON E, 2019; BUKHT R, 2017; CEBI S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2012.10.036; CHEN I J, 2003, DOI 10.1108/14637150310496758; CHEN W, 2004; CHEN Z, 2017, DOI 10.1186/s40854-017-0062-0; CUI M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2016.10.001; DI FATTA D, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.12.008; E-COMMERCE, 2020; GIUA C, 2021, DOI 10.1108/bfj-05-2020-0420; GOVENDER P, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.apr.2019.09.009; GROVER P, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s10479-020-03683-9; GROVER V, 2018, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2018.1451951; GUNN V, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2019.103388; HARRISON D, 2019, DOI 10.1057/s41270-019-00063-6; KIM N, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.10.006; KREMEZ Z, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.ausmj.2019.04.002; KWAK D H, 2019; LATIF Z, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.006; LI F, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11747-020-00733-3; LIN R, 2010, DOI 10.1108/02635571011008434; NEIROTTI P, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jeim-09-2016-0158; NICA E, 2015; NORRIS P, 2001; OHN MAR S, 2004; OJO A, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-63743-3_11; OUMAR T, 2017, DOI 10.1515/mmcks-2017-0039; PAZAITIS A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2017.05.025; PENARD T, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2017.08.003; RICHARDSON L, 2021, DOI 10.1177/0263775820959677; RODRÍGUEZ-ARDURA I, 2008; SHEN C, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2019.106177; STATISTA, 2021; SUGAR C, 2003, DOI 10.1198/016214503000000666; SZELES M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.007; THAICHON P, 2018, DOI 10.1080/08853134.2018.1441718; TSIMONIS G, 2014, DOI 10.1108/mip-04-2013-0056; YUE T, 2020",1,2021,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000679999500012,ISI,UNIV ZAGREB;UNIV ZAGREB;UNIV OSIJEK,UNIV ZAGREB,NA,"JAKOVIC B, 2021, BUS SYST RES J","JAKOVIC B, 2021, BUS SYST RES J",CROATIA;CROATIA;CROATIA,10.2478/bsrj-2021-0013,NA,BUSINESS,1,SCIENDO,NA,WOS

WE USE A LOGIT MODEL AND DATA SET OF 69 HIGH- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES FOR THE PERIOD 2005-2015. WE FIND A NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNET USE AND EDUCATION INEQUALITY FOR THE WHOLE SAMPLE. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THAT, IN ADDITION TO THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND OTHER SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES, THE DISTRIBUTION OF FORMAL EDUCATION AMONG CITIZENS WITHIN A COUNTRY IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN INTERNET USE. WE ALSO OBTAIN THAT THIS DISTRIBUTION AFFECTS INTERNET USE TO A HIGHER EXTENT IN MIDDLE-INCOME ECONOMIES IN COMPARISON WITH HIGH-INCOME ONES. UNLIKE THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL LEVELS OBTAINED IN THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE, THE EXISTENCE OF WITHIN-COUNTRY EDUCATIONAL DISPARITIES NEGATIVELY INFLUENCES INTERNET USE.

AS WE DEMONSTRATE STATISTICALLY WITH A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA SET, THE DIGITALLY CONFIDENT HAVE LOWER PROBABILITY OF EXPERIENCING PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PANDEMIC ANXIETY AND HIGHER PROBABILITY OF ADEQUATELY COMPREHENDING CRITICAL INFORMATION ON COVID-19. THE EFFECTS OF DIGITAL CONFIDENCE ON BOTH PANDEMIC ANXIETY AND COVID-19 COMPREHENSION PERSIST, EVEN AFTER A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIALLY CONFOUNDING FACTORS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, INCLUDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS AGE, GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, METROPOLITAN STATUS, AND PARTNER STATUS.

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO DELVE INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAIRY FARMERS AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES VIA E-GOVERNMENT, COMPARING THIS AREA TO ANOTHER EIGHT CONCERNING THE FARMER'S NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS IN RELATION TO THE ICT IN DIFFERENT FIELDS OF THEIR BUSINESS. WE OBSERVED THAT AREAS SUCH AS CONNECTIVITY AND DIGITAL INCLUSION ARE THE MOST COVERED AREAS NOT ONLY AT THE STUDY LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL SINCE COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP POLITICS TO PUT AN END TO THE SO-CALLED ""DIGITAL DIVIDE,"" WHICH AFFECTS RURAL AREAS MORE INTENSELY. THIS IS INCREASING DUE TO THE GROWING TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS. THE AREAS OF THE MARKET, PRODUCTION, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT AND COUNSELING, SMART FARMING, AND INTERNET OF THINGS HAVE BEEN APPROACHED, ASSOCIATED WITH THE ICT IN DAIRY FARMS, SHOWING IN THE LATTER TWO AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PAPERS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE AREA OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION IN RELATION TO DAIRY FARMS HAS ALSO BEEN COVERED, BEING REMARKABLE THE LOW NUMBER OF PIECES OF RESEARCH CONCERNING THE INTERACTION BY THE FARMERS, MORE SPECIFICALLY BY DAIRY FARMERS, WITH THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS SURPRISING DUE TO THE NEW GLOBAL NEED AND ESPECIALLY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) OF INTERACTING WITH IT TELEMATICALLY BY ALL LEGAL ENTITIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE STILL BARRIERS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT (E-GOVERNMENT) SINCE THE WEBSITES DO NOT MEET THE USER'S EXPECTATIONS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY LAYS THE GROUND FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON THIS AREA.

THE ARTICLE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY LOOKING AT THE ROLE OF BOTH SOCIAL BACKGROUND, AS MEASURED BY SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS (SES), IN THIS INEQUALITY, AND THAT OF SCHOOLS. A MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO DIGITAL INEQUALITY IS PROPOSED, INCORPORATING THE FREQUENCY AND QUALITY OF USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA, AS WELL AS ICT ACCESS. TO THIS END, MULTIPLE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS ARE ESTIMATED USING DATA FROM THE LAST PISA CYCLE (2018), FOR A TOTAL OF 161,443 STUDENTS FROM 6261 SCHOOLS AND 21 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, TO CHECK THE INFLUENCE ON EACH OF THESE THREE DIMENSIONS OF BOTH THE SES AND THE INTEGRATION OF ICT IN SCHOOLS. THE RESULTS CONFIRM THAT FOR MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES: (1) ACCESS TO ICT AT HOME IS INFLUENCED TO A GREATER EXTENT BY THE FAMILY'S SES THAN BY THE INTEGRATION OF ICT AT SCHOOL; (2) BOTH THE FREQUENCY AND QUALITY OF USE OF ICT AT HOME ARE INFLUENCED MORE BY THE INTEGRATION OF ICT AT SCHOOL THAN BY THE SES OF THE FAMILY, WHILE IN SOME COUNTRIES THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOCIAL ASPECT IS PRACTICALLY IRRELEVANT. THEREFORE, THE INTEGRATION OF ICT IN SCHOOLS EMERGES AS A COMPENSATORY MEASURE FOR THE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES OF STUDENTS AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE REDUCTION OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY.","UNIV LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA, FAC ECON EMPRESA & TURISMO, DEPT METODOS CUANTITAT ECON & GEST, LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA 35017, SPAIN.;  AGENCIA CANARIA CALIDAD UNIV & EVALUAC EDUC ACCUE, CALLE GRANADERA CANARIA 2, LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA 35071, SPAIN.;  UNIV LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA, FAC CIENCIAS JURID, DEPT PSICOL SOCIOL & TRABAJO SOCIAL, LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA 35017, SPAIN.","GONZALEZ-BETANCOR, SM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA, FAC ECON EMPRESA & TURISMO, DEPT METODOS CUANTITAT ECON & GEST, LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA 35017, SPAIN.","ADAM T, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10639-017-9605-2; BATI T, 2021, DOI 10.1002/isd2.12148; BEAUNOYER E, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2020.106424; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; EICKELMANN B, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10639-016-9498-5; ERDOGDU F, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.023; FACER K, 2001, DOI 10.1080/13676260120101905; FERGUSON D, 2020; FERNANDEZ-GUTIERREZ M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103969; GUBBELS J, 2020, DOI 10.1186/s40536-020-0079-0; HARGITTAI E, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0617-5; HATLEVIK O, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.11.015; HOHLFELD T, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2017.05.017; HU X, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.05.021; IIVARI N, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102183; JUHANAK L, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2019.103614; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; LUTZ C, 2019, DOI 10.1002/hbe2.140; MANZANO D, 2019, DOI 10.3989/ris.2019.77.3.17.165; FORMICHELLA M, 2020, DOI 10.14201/eks.23553; MENESES J, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01972241003712231; OECD, 2019; OECD, 2015; OECD, 2020; PASSERON J C, 2008; PETKO D, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0735633116649373; PULLEN D, 2015; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819869604; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; SCHERER R, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2019.04.011; SCHIZZEROTTO A, 2017; SCHULZE L, 2020; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SHIN HYOUNG S, 2019, DOI 10.22804/jke.2019.46.1.005; SKRYABIN M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2015.02.004; SRIJAMDEE K, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s10639-019-10089-z; STEVENSON O, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2011.00430.x; TRAPEZNIKOVA I, 2019, DOI 10.15185/izawol.462; VAN DER VLIES R, 2020, DOI 10.1787/33dd4c26-en; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; ALDERETE M, 2017, DOI 10.4438/1988-592x-re-2017-377-353; WARSCHAUER M, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i7.967; WARSCHAUER M, 2010, DOI 10.3102/0091732x09349791; WEBER M, 2008; XIAO Y, 2019, DOI 10.3991/ijet.v14i15.10494; XIAO Y, 2019, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01646; ZHANG D, 2016, DOI 10.12973/eurasia.2016.1297a; ZILKA G C, 2020",12,2021,COMPUTER SCIENCE; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000649188600009,ISI,UNIV LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA;AGENCIA CANARIA CALIDAD UNIV AND EVALUAC EDUC ACCUE;UNIV LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA,UNIV LAS PALMAS GRAN CANARIA,NA,"GONZALEZ-BETANCOR SM, 2021, COMPUT EDUC","GONZALEZ-BETANCOR SM, 2021, COMPUT EDUC",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.compedu.2021.104195,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH",12,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,NA,WOS

SCI.,ARTICLE,COVID-19; PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES; SOCIAL MEDIA; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; ONLINE PARTICIPATION,NA,"THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE ENSUING STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS CAUSED TREMENDOUS RESTRICTIONS IN SOCIAL CONTACTS, WHICH LED TO INCREASING USE OF THE INTERNET FOR DAILY TASKS AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. AS PRIOR RESEARCH HAS ESTABLISHED, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES (PWD) HAD ALREADY BEEN USING THE INTERNET FOR SUCH PURPOSES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY FOR HEALTH-RELATED CONTENT. THROUGH A NATIONAL SURVEY ADMINISTERED DURING THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE UNITED STATES, WE EXPLORE HOW PEOPLE WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION AND ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES ABOUT COVID-19. FINDINGS REVEAL THAT PWD WERE MORE ENGAGED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 THAN THOSE WITHOUT DISABILITIES, EVEN WHEN CONTROLLING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS AND INTERNET EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS.

THIS ARTICLE CHALLENGES THIS DISCOURSE BY DRAWING ON FINDINGS FROM A LARGE-SCALE STUDY (N = 810) CONDUCTED ON A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN ENGLAND THAT CRITICALLY EXAMINED STUDENT'S PERCEPTIONS OF AND ATTITUDES TO DIFFERENT FORMS OF ONLINE HARASSMENT, INCLUDING ABUSIVE, OFFENSIVE AND HARASSING COMMUNICATIONS, USING SURVEY AND INTERVIEW DATA. KEY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ONLINE HARASSMENT IS SO PERVASIVE IN DIGITISED SPACES THAT IT IS OFTEN VIEWED AS THE 'NORM' BY THE STUDENT POPULATION WHO APPEAR WILLING TO TOLERATE IT, RATHER THAN TAKE ACTIONS TO ADDRESS IT, WHICH CHALLENGES PEJORATIVE CLAIMS THAT THEY ARE INTOLERANT AND EASILY OFFENDED 'SNOWFLAKES'. RESPONDENTS WHO IDENTIFY AS FEMALE AND TRANSGENDER ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE TARGETED BY ONLINE HARASSMENT. WE ARGUE THAT THE LABEL 'SNOWFLAKE GENERATION' IS DIVERTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM STUDENT'S EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES OF ONLINE HARASSMENT AND ITS ADVERSE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY ON WOMEN AND TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE A GENDER-RELATED DIGITAL DIVIDE (JANE, 2018). THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR WILL BE OUTLINED.","UNIV LIVERPOOL, MEDIA, LIVERPOOL, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LIVERPOOL, LIVERPOOL, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.;  UNIV LIVERPOOL, POLIT COMMUN, LIVERPOOL, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.","HASLOP, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LIVERPOOL, DEPT COMMUN & MEDIA, LIVERPOOL L69 3BX, MERSEYSIDE, ENGLAND.","BANET-WEISER S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/14680777.2016.1120490; BROOK, 2019; CROWN PROSECUTION S, 2017; FINLEY L, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0160597619832627; FOX C, 2016; FOX C, 2016; GILLETT R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.wsif.2018.04.005; HARMER E, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-12633-9_1; HASLOP C, 2021, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2020.1792531; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; HERRING S, 2002; JANE E, 2018; JANE E, 2016, DOI 10.1080/10304312.2016.1166560; JONES L, 2013, DOI 10.1037/a0030309; KENDALL, 2002; MASSANARI A, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815608807; MEGARRY J, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.wsif.2014.07.012; MYERS C, 2019, DOI 10.3390/ijerph16071217; MYERS C, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0022022116684208; NICHOLSON R, 2016; PEW RESEARCH C, 2017; PRICE-FEENEY, 2016; REGEHR K, 2018; RIVERS N, 2017; SALTER M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604133; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SIAPERA E, 2019; SNELSON C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1609406915624574; SOUTHERN R, 2021, DOI 10.1177/0894439319865519; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812",3,2021,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000628937400001,ISI,UNIV LIVERPOOL;UNIV LIVERPOOL;UNIV LIVERPOOL,UNIV LIVERPOOL,NA,"HASLOP C, 2021, CONVERGENCE","HASLOP C, 2021, CONVERGENCE",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/1354856521989270,NA,COMMUNICATION,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING COUNCIL FOR ENGLAND (HEFCE),WOS

ISS.,ARTICLE,AGEING SOCIETY; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL EXCLUSION; NEW TECHNOLOGIES; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,TECHNOLOGIES,"THE AIM OF THE ARTICLE IS TO IDENTIFY AND ANALYZE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION IN AN AGEING SOCIETY ON THE EXAMPLE OF POLAND. THE AGEING OF SOCIETIES IS NOWADAYS A PROCESS RECOGNIZED AS A COMMON TREND IN THE WORLD. DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES CAUSE SERIOUS SOCIO-ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATIONS. CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS ARE DEPENDENT ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES. FULL PARTICIPATION IN A TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENT IS POSSIBLE ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC TECHNICAL, SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPETENCES. THE ABILITY TO USE NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES BECOMES A LIFE NECESSITY. IN THIS CONTEXT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ENDOGENOUS AND EXOGENOUS DETERMIANTS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION IN AGEING SOCIETIES, AS WELL AS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ON THE EMERGENCE OF NEW DIMENSIONS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION HAVE BEEN RAISED. THE METHODOLOGICAL BASIS OF THE STUDY ARE THE THEORIES OF SOCIAL AND DIGITAL EXCLUSION, AS WELL AS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES. THE INFORMATION BASES FOR THE STUDY WERE THE GUS (CENTRAL STATISTICAL OFFICE IN POLAND) REPORTS, EUROSTAT DATA BASE AND SEVERAL STATISTIC REPORTS OF NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS IN POLAND. THE ANALYZED PERIOD INCLUDES 2015-2019 YEARS IN CASES WHERE THE DEVELOPMENT TRENDS ARE DISCUSSES AND 2019 TO SHOW THE IMPLICATIONS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IMPACT ON POLISH SOCIETY. THE FORECASTS REACH UP TO 2060. THE THEORETICAL STUDY IS BASED ON THE ANALYTICAL AND SEMANTIC METHOD. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION IN AN AGEING SOCIETY SHOULD COVER A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF FACTORS CAUSING NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. EXOGENOUS FACTORS, I.E. BARRIERS PREVENTING INTERNET USE COMBINED WITH LACK OF ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND LACK OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY TO ENDOGENOUS FACTORS. MOTIVATION TO DEVELOP AND ACQUIRE NEW SKILLS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL LIFE STRATEGIES OF THE ELDERLY PLAYS AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PROCESS OF SOCIAL SELF-EXCLUSION. AUTHORS ALSO IDENTIFIES THE MAIN DIMENSIONS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND PRESENTS THEM AS A MULTI-FACTOR MODEL: MARKET - TRUST - ECONOMY; INFORMATION POLICY; MARKETING - INFORMATION - KNOWLEDGE; ELECTRONIC DEMOCRACY; QUALITY OF LIFE - HEALTH.

SANTOS E; HALKIAS D,DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS AND LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES: A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY FROM ANGOLA,JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,J. ENTERP. COMMUNITIES,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; INCLUSIVE GROWTH; SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT; JOBLESS ECONOMIC GROWTH; LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES; DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS (DOI); RAPID TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION; STAKEHOLDER; TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION,NA,"PURPOSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS QUALITATIVE MULTIPLE CASE STUDY WAS TO GAIN A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VIEWS OF STAKEHOLDERS RESIDING WITHIN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES IN ANGOLA ON RAPID TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION AND ITS IMPLICATION ON LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES WITHIN THEIR REGIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS GAP, AND CONSISTENT WITH THE QUALITATIVE PARADIGM, THIS PAPER CONDUCTED METHODOLOGICAL TRIANGULATION OF THE STUDY'S MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND ARCHIVAL DATA IN THE FORM OF GOVERNMENT LABOR REPORTS, REFLECTIVE FIELD NOTES AND ARCHIVAL DATA TO ESTABLISH THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF THE STUDY'S DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A GAP IN THE LITERATURE EXISTS BETWEEN THE GENERAL DIFFUSION OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT RESULTS IN AN AMBIGUOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THEORY, ACADEMIA AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE AMONG SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES. TO INFORM GOVERNMENTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON HOW TO EFFECTIVELY ACHIEVE THE DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS (DOI), THIS INTEGRATIVE LITERATURE REVIEW SUPPORTS A BROADER QUALITATIVE MULTIPLE CASE STUDY THAT OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO THE VIEWS OF STAKEHOLDERS RESIDING WITHIN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES IN ANGOLA, ON RAPID TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION AND ITS IMPLICATION FOR LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES. THIS OVERVIEW OF EXISTING RESEARCH OFFERS A TARGETED KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT CAN SUPPORT FUTURE RESEARCH AND HELP PROMOTE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES. BY ADDRESSING THE PATTERNS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VARIOUS ECONOMIC IMBALANCES AND THE ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGY THAT PROMOTE THE SOCIAL DIVIDE, ALONG WITH HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE OVERALL TECHNOLOGICAL DUALISM BETWEEN VARIOUS SOCIAL GROUPS, PROMISES EFFECTIVE POLICIES FOR SUCCESSFUL DOI IN IMPOVERISHED SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN REGIONS BY EVALUATING ITS IMPACT ON LOCAL LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES. FINDINGS THE RESULTS OF THIS MULTIPLE CASE STUDY RESEARCH OVERSEE A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE DATA COLLECTED BASED ON THE STUDY'S MULTIPLE SOURCES, FOLLOWING A CROSS-CASE ANALYSIS IN WHICH THIS PAPER SYNTHESIZES THE FINDINGS OF THE INITIAL THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF DATA TO ANSWER THE STUDY'S CENTRAL RESEARCH QUESTION. THE MULTIPLE CASE STUDY APPROACH IN THIS RESEARCH FOLLOWS THE CONCEPT OF REPLICATION LOGIC DISCUSSED BY YIN (2017) IN WHICH THE SAME FINDINGS ARE REPLICATED ACROSS MULTIPLE CASES AS SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES ARE TRACED ACROSS CASES, AND THE STUDY RESULTS OBTAINED IN THIS WAY ARE DEEMED ROBUST AND RELIABLE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS A POTENTIAL KEY LIMITATION IN THIS STUDY WAS ASSOCIATED TO THE PARTICIPANTS' LIMITED EXPERIENCES ABOUT THE STUDY'S CENTRAL PHENOMENON, WHICH IF INADEQUATE, COULD NOT HAVE BEEN REFLECTIVE OF THE CHALLENGES FACED AND SHARED BY THE TARGET POPULATION. THIS STUDY MITIGATES THE LIMITATION WITH AN OBSERVATION IN WHICH A MUCH SHARPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTICIPANTS' KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE TOPIC OF INTEREST WAS DEVELOPED. ANOTHER LIMITATION WAS THE SAMPLE SIZE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SMALL AND MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION. THIS STUDY MITIGATES THE LIMITATION THROUGH CAREFUL INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA AND STRONG CONCLUSION OF RESULTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS, THIS STUDY EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICIPATIVE APPROACHES TO ICT IMPLEMENTATION THAT IF WELL ADAPTED BY POLICYMAKERS COULD LEAD TO A MORE CONTEXTUALLY ANCHORED ICT-SUPPORTED POVERTY ALLEVIATION WITHIN DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THIS STUDY ADDRESSES AN UNDER-RESEARCHED AREA ON WHY INNOVATION POLICY INITIATIVES CALLING FOR TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION IN ANGOLA CONTINUE TO STALL RATHER THAN COMBATING LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES IN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES. THIS STUDY BRINGS THE VOICES OF LOCAL POPULATIONS ON TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION IN IMPOVERISHED REGIONS OF ANGOLA TO THE EXTANT LITERATURE, LAUNCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BODY OF KNOWLEDGE THAT MAY POINT THE WAY TO A PROMISING AVENUE OF SOCIAL CHANGE THROUGH INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS RESEARCH IS ORIGINAL AND SIGNIFICANT IN THAT IT ADDRESSES AN UNDER-RESEARCHED AREA ON INNOVATION POLICY INITIATIVES CALLING FOR TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION IN ANGOLA THAT CONTINUE TO STALL RATHER THAN COMBATING LABOR MARKET CHALLENGES IN IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES. THIS STUDY ALSO MAKES AN ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION TO ROGERS'S SEMINAL THEORY AND CONCEPT OF DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS. THE STUDY'S RESULTS GUIDED FURTHER RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND INNOVATION DIFFUSION WITHIN ANGOLA, A NATION FACED WITH POOR HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT AND AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF THE WORLD'S POOREST PEOPLE AND UNEMPLOYMENT.","NATL AGCY OIL & GAS & BIOFUELS, DEPT DATA MANAGEMENT, LUANDA, ANGOLA.;

ALLMANN K; BLANK G,"RETHINKING DIGITAL SKILLS IN THE ERA OF COMPULSORY COMPUTING: METHODS, MEASUREMENT, POLICY AND THEORY",INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,INFO. COMMUN. SOC.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL SKILLS; COMPULSORY COMPUTING; PATH ABSTRACTION; DIGITAL BY DEFAULT; ETHNOGRAPHY,NA,"AROUND THE WORLD, DIGITAL PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME THE FIRST - OR ONLY - OPTION FOR MANY EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES. THE UNITED KINGDOM, FOR INSTANCE, IS IMPLEMENTING A 'DIGITAL-BY-DEFAULT' E-GOVERNMENT AGENDA, WHICH HAS STEADILY DIGITIZED VITAL SERVICES SUCH AS TAXES, PENSIONS, AND WELFARE. THIS PERVASIVE DIGITIZATION MARKS AN IMPORTANT SHIFT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIETY AND COMPUTING; PEOPLE ARE COMPELLED TO USE COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE BASIC TASKS. WE SUGGEST THAT THIS ERA OF COMPULSORY COMPUTING DEMANDS NEW WAYS OF MEASURING AND THEORIZING ABOUT DIGITAL SKILLS, WHICH REMAIN A CRUCIAL DIMENSION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE RE-EXAMINE THE THEORY AND MEASUREMENT OF DIGITAL SKILLS, MAKING THREE CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DIGITAL SKILLS ARE ENCOUNTERED, ACQUIRED, AND CONCEPTUALIZED. FIRST, WE INTRODUCE A NEW METHODOLOGY TO RESEARCH SKILLS: PARTICIPANT-OBSERVATION OF NOVICES IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING NEW SKILLS ALONG WITH INTERVIEWS WITH THE PEOPLE WHO HELP THEM. OUR ETHNOGRAPHICALLY INFORMED METHOD LEADS US TO A SECOND CONTRIBUTION: A DIFFERENT THEORY OF SKILLS, WHICH IDENTIFIES THREE PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS: (1) SEQUENCE, (2) SIMULTANEITY, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, (3) PATH ABSTRACTION. THIRD, WE ARGUE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS SUGGEST THE NEED TO CHANGE CURRENT WAYS SKILLS ARE MEASURED, AND WE ALSO DISCUSS THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THIS EMPIRICALLY INFORMED THEORY.","UNIV OXFORD, CTR SOCIOLEGAL STUDIES, OXFORD, ENGLAND.;  UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, 1 ST GILES, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","BLANK, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, 1 ST GILES, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","ATTEWELL P, 2001; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BLANK G, 2019; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BRAUN V, 2006, DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; EYNON R, 2021, DOI 10.1002/berj.3686; EYNON R, 2009, DOI 10.1080/17439880903345874; FABIAN J, 2014; HACKETT, 2018, DOI https://; HARGITTAI E, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x; HARGITTAI E, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0894439305275911; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.1002/asi.10166; HARGITTAI E, 2002; HARGITTAI E, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0894439310397146; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323113499113; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; KLINENBERG E, 2018; KRUGER J, 1999, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121; MESCH, 2020, DOI https://; NTSEBEZA L, 1995; OFCOM, 2019, DOI 10.1021/ja035727c; RUST E, 2014; RYAN G W, 2003, DOI 10.1177/1525822x02239569; SMYTHE S, 2017; TALJA S, 2005, DOI 10.1002/asi.20091; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2010.496338; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2020; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004",8,2021,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000620056800001,ISI,UNIV OXFORD;UNIV OXFORD,UNIV OXFORD,NA,"ALLMANN K, 2021, INFO COMMUN SOC","ALLMANN K, 2021, INFO COMMUN SOC",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/1369118x.2021.1874475,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE SEED FUND; UNIVERSITY'S HEFCE HIGHER EDUCATION INNOVATION FUND (HEIF) AWARD,WOS

THE PARTICIPANTS (N = 560) WERE RETIRED ADULTS (AGE OVER 54) WHO RESIDED IN SPAIN AND WERE HABITUAL USERS OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS. TWO MULTIGROUP ANALYSES WITH STRUCTURAL EQUATIONS WERE PERFORMED, USING THE TYPE OF INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND THE AGE RANGE AS MODERATING VARIABLES. THREE INCREMENTAL LEVELS OF APPROPRIATION WERE FOUND ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACCESS, USE, SKILLS AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS. FURTHERMORE, THE DATA SHOWED THAT THE EFFECT OF FORMAL SUPPORT FOR LITERACY ON INTERNET APPROPRIATION IS MODERATED BY TYPE OF INSTITUTION AND SUGGEST THAT INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORTS ARE MORE NECESSARY IN OLDER AGES.","UNIV HUELVA, DEPT PEDAG, CAMPUS EL CARMEN, HUELVA 21007, SPAIN.;  UNIV OVIEDO, DEPT EDUC SCI, CAMPUS LLAMAQU,C ANICETO SELA S-N, OVIEDO 33005, SPAIN.;  UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT JOURNALISM & NEW MEDIA, MADRID, SPAIN.","RODRIGUEZ-MARTIN, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OVIEDO, DEPT EDUC SCI, CAMPUS LLAMAQU,C ANICETO SELA S-N, OVIEDO 33005, SPAIN.","ABAD ALCALA L, 2014, DOI 10.3916/c42-2014-17; BARNARD Y, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.006; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BRANDTZAEG P, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.008; BYRNE B M, 2013; CASADO-MUNOZ R, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-04; CHAFFIN A, 2007, DOI 10.3928/00989134-20070301-03; CHEN Y, 2002, DOI 10.1080/03601270290099921; CHEUNG G, 2002, DOI 10.1207/s15328007sem0902_5; CORREA T, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2018.1555270; CURRAN P, 1996, DOI 10.1037//1082-989x.1.1.16; CZAJA S, 2018, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnw249; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1086/ahr/69.3.805; EUROPEAN C, 2010; EUROSTAT, 2019; EUROSTAT, 2019; FRANCIS J, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0002764218773829; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GARNHAM N, 1997, DOI 10.1080/13183222.1997.11008658; GATTO S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03601270802243697; GOLDHAMMER F, 2013, DOI 10.1027/1015-5759/a000153; HAIR J, 2006; HARDILL I, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.03.016; HARGITTAI E, 2010; HEART T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.03.002; KU Y, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2012.08.009; MAGSAMEN-CONRAD K, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.05.024; MILLWARD P, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066; MORRIS A, 2007, DOI 10.11645/1.3.14; MOSSBERGER K, 2012; MURRAY MEG C, 2014; NEVES B, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.11.002; NEWHAGEN J, 2004; NIMROD G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1164740; PAPACHARISSI Z, 2000, DOI 10.1207/s15506878jobem4402_2; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; QUAN-HAASE A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0002764218777572; QUAN-HAASE A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1305428; QUAN-HAASE A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1140217; SAYAGO S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2011.06.001; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHEHL B, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.031; SCHREURS K, 2017, DOI 10.22230/cjc2017v42n2a3130; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SHAPIRA N, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13607860601086546; SOURBATI M, 2009, DOI 10.1177/1461444809340786; SUM S, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0010; VAN BOEKEL LEONIEKE C, 2017, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6853; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42; WITTE J, 2010; WYATT S, 2005, DOI 10.1177/1461444805050747; XIE B, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10823-007-9050-6; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",3,2021,SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000632469300015,ISI,UNIV HUELVA;UNIV OVIEDO;UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV OVIEDO,NA,"TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2021, TECHNOL SOC","TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2021, TECHNOL SOC",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101505,NA,"SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"R + D PROJECT ""YOUTUBERS AND INSTAGRAMMERS: MEDIA COMPETENCE IN EMERGING PROSUMERS"" - STATE RESEARCH AGENCY OF THE SPANISH MINISTRY OF SCIENCE, INNOVATION AND UNIVERSITIES [RTI2018-093303-B-I00]; EUROPEAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT FUND (ERDF)",WOS

THERE IS MUCH RESEARCH THAT ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. THESE STUDIES HAVE ANALYZED AND COMPARED HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS (HDI) AND INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECH-NOLOGY (ICT) DEVELOPMENT INDEX (IDI) FROM VARIOUS GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR ON A RANDOMIZED BASIS. THERE IS MUCH RESEARCH THAT ANALYSES THE IMPACT OF IDI ON HDI. THIS STUDY WANTS TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC AND DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES THAT MAKE UP A REGION WHOSE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL RELATION HAVE A LONG HISTORICAL TRADITION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE CHOSE THE COUNTRIES BORDERING THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA, SINCE, IN ADDITION TO THESE TRADITIONAL RELATIONS, THERE ARE RECENT EURO-MEDITERRANEAN ASSOCIATION AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE COUNTRIES OF NORTH AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, WHOSE OBJECTIVE, AMONG OTHERS, IS SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL COLLABORATION. THE POTENTIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HDI AND THE HDI IS TO BE KNOWN AND WHETHER IT CAN IMPROVE THE WAY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ASSESS THEIR LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT. THE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE HDI AND IDI BEHAVIOR SHOWS US THAT HUMAN AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT WAS PROGRESSING WITH AVERAGE GROWTH RATES OF 23% AND 2.5%, RESPECTIVELY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES ALSO NARROWED FURTHER IN HDI, WITH A DECREASE OF 7.4%, COMPARED WITH A 5.2% DECREASE IN IDI. WHEN THE CONVERSION WAS DONE TO THE SAME SCALE, THERE WAS AN AVERAGE DIFFERENCE OF 0.2 POINTS BETWEEN THE TWO INDEX VALUES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES STUDIED WERE CLOSER TO ACHIEVING A RAPPROCHEMENT IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT THAN IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL BY POLICYMAKERS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, TO REINFORCE THEIR INTENTIONS TO SUPPORT THE USE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ICT.","UNIV GRANADA, DEPT APPL ECON, GRANADA, SPAIN.;  UNIV CAMPUS MELILLA, C SANTANDER 1, MELILLA 52071, SPAIN.;  UNIV GRANADA, GRANADA, SPAIN.;  UNIV GRANADA, DEPT STAT & OPERAT RES, GRANADA, SPAIN.","MONTERO-ALONSO, MA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CAMPUS MELILLA, C SANTANDER 1, MELILLA 52071, SPAIN.; MONTERO-ALONSO, MA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GRANADA, DEPT STAT & OPERAT RES, GRANADA, SPAIN.","ALVAREZ I, 2007; ARCELUS F J, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0038-0121(02)00046-0; BARRO R, 1995; BARTOLOM A, 2013; BERKEY C, 2014, DOI 12/83083/how-cell-phones-are-transforming-health-care-in-africa/.; BOULOS M, 2011, DOI 10.1186/1475-925x-10-24; BRAVEMAN P, 2003, DOI 10.1136/jech.57.4.254; CASTILLO M, 2013; COBO-ROMANI J, 2009; CUBAN L, 2001, DOI 10.3102/00028312038004813; DAI Z, 2013, DOI 10.1109/issrew.2013.6688847; DE LA FUENTE A, 2008; DE LA GARZA Y, 2006; DE LA HOZ-ROSALES B, 2019, DOI 10.1109/access.2019.2939404; FOLADORI G, 2005, DOI 10.22136/est002005308; FOLADORI G, 2012; GURLUK S, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.03.001; HAMELINK C, 1997; HANCLOVA J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2014.916249; HAQ M, 1999; HARRIS R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2015.1018115; KAHN J, 2010, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.2009.0965; KATZ R, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2013.06.004; KIISKI S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3; LABRA R, 2014; LEE J, 2001, DOI https://; MACLEAN D, 2002; MAKAROVIC M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/09654313.2013.782387; MAMTANI R, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1757913913491350; MINISTR J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2014.903887; MOHAMED-MIMON M, 2017; MOKYR J, 1990; MOSA A, 2012, DOI 10.1186/1472-6947-12-67; NEMER D, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2015.1011598; NGWENYAMA O, 2006; NOSIRU O, 2019; OECD, 2013, DOI 10.1787/9789264201392-en; OLIVEIRA M R N S, 2001, DOI 10.1590/s1413-24782001000300009; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2001, DOI 10.1287/isre.12.2.121.9700; OYELARAN-OYEYINKA B, 2006; PADDOCK C, 2014; PAYNE J, 2012, DOI 10.3389/fnint.2012.00108; PONELIS S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2015.1010307; PORTER M, 1985, DOI 10.1108/eb039075; QURESHI S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2013.818827; RIFKIN J, 2011; ROSENTHAL G, 2013; SAHAY S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2014.933522; SAMOILENKO S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2014.927348; SEN A, 1981; SHARMA B, 2004; SINGER D, 2006; SOEFTESTAD L, 2003; TERZIYAN V, 2015, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2014.899955; UNDP, 2013; UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT P, 2004; VALDERRAMA SANTIBÁÑEZ ANA L, 2011; YAKUNINA R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/s2212-5671(15)00692-9",14,2021,SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000632468200014,ISI,UNIV GRANADA;UNIV CAMPUS MELILLA;UNIV GRANADA;UNIV GRANADA,UNIV CAMPUS MELILLA;UNIV GRANADA,NA,"PEREZ-CASTRO MA, 2021, TECHNOL SOC","PEREZ-CASTRO MA, 2021, TECHNOL SOC",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101452,NA,"SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,NA,WOS

IT EXPLORES WORKING WOMEN'S PERCEPTION ON DIGITAL RESOURCES AND DEVICES AS WORKING TOOLS AND THEIR USE. IT ALSO ASSESSES DIFFERENCES IN USAGE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF STUDIES AND MAKES A PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS ABOUT WOMEN WORKERS' ASSESSMENT, USE AND PURPOSE TYPES OF DIGITAL DEVICES AND RESOURCES. THE STUDY INVOLVED THREE HUNDRED AND SEVEN WOMEN WITH SECONDARY STUDIES AND AN AVERAGE AGE OF THIRTY-THREE YEARS. THEY WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE POPULATION OF WORKERS OF A SPANISH COMMERCIAL COMPANY. THE SCALE EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND DIGITAL COMPETENCE, DEVELOPED AD HOC, WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL LITERACY AND THE ACQUISITION OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE (RECEIVER-CONSUMER AND TRANSMITTER-CREATOR). THE RESULTS OBTAINED THROUGH DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS, COMPARISON OF MEANS AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT WORKERS HAVE A MEDIUM LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, WHILE THEIR PARTICIPATION AND USE IN THE WORK CONTEXT IS MORE LIMITED. THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL IS A RELEVANT FACTOR IN WORKER'S PERCEPTION ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES. WOMEN WORKERS' DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE, PREDICTS A GREATER PARTICIPATION AND USE OF DEVICES AND RESOURCES, WHAT CONSTITUTES A SATISFACTION AND SUCCESS WORK FACTOR. SOME CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PRACTICE, SUCH AS THE NECESSITY OF EXPANDING AND IMPROVING WOMEN WORKERS' TRAINING, ARE DERIVED FROM THE STUDY.

IN AN AGE OF DIGITAL COMMUNICATION ABUNDANCE AND CLOSING INTERNET ACCESS DIVIDES, OVERUSE HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED NOR ARE ITS SOCIAL DISPARITIES KNOWN. IN A FIRST STEP, PDO IS DEMARCATED FROM INTERNET ADDICTION, THEORETICALLY DEFINED, AND OPERATIONALIZED. THEN, THE PREVALENCE OF PERCEIVED OVERUSE IS ASSESSED IN A REPRESENTATIVE POPULATION SAMPLE OF ITALIAN INTERNET USERS (N = 2,008) AND PREDICTORS OF DIGITAL OVERUSE ARE TESTED. RESULTS SHOW THAT DIGITAL COMMUNICATION USE AND THE LEVEL OF SOCIAL PRESSURE TO FUNCTION DIGITALLY ARE POSITIVELY RELATED TO PDO. EDUCATION IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PDO AND POSITIVELY WITH DIGITAL COMMUNICATION USE AND SOCIAL DIGITAL PRESSURE. OVERUSE IS EMERGING AS A NEW DIMENSION OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY AND FUTURE RESEARCH IN DIGITAL WELL-BEING.","UNIV MILANO BICOCCA, DEPT SOCIOL & SOCIAL RES, MILAN, ITALY.;  UNIV ZURICH, DEPT COMMUN & MEDIA RES IKMZ, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;  UNIV ZURICH, DIGITAL SOC INITIAT DSI, ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.","GUI, MR (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MILANO BICOCCA, I-2016 MILAN, ITALY.","AMICHAI-HAMBURGER Y, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.009; AYYAGARI R, 2011; BAUMEISTER R, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jcps.2007.10.002; BEETHAM H, 2015; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BOLLEN K, 1987, DOI 10.1177/0049124187015004002; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BUCHI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604154; CAPLAN S, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.012; CAPLAN S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00004-3; CARRADORE R, 2017; DAVID P, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1461444814531692; DICKINSON J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2016.06.005; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.307; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DIMAGGIO P, 2008, DOI 10.1177/000312240807300203; GOOGLE, 2018; GREENFIELD D, 2011, DOI 10.1002/9781118013991.ch8; GUI M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389751; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HELSPER E, 2015; HERRERO J, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0894439317742611; HOFMANN W, 2017; HOFMANN W, 2012, DOI 10.1037/a0026545; HU L, 1999, DOI 10.1080/10705519909540118; KAHNEMAN D, 2006, DOI 10.1257/089533006776526030; KARR-WISNIEWSKI P, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.008; KAZAKOVA S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/15213269.2015.1006789; KIMBROUGH A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.005; KIRKCALDY B, 2000, DOI 10.1002/(sici)1099-1700(200003)16:2<77::aid-smi835>3.3.coq; KNOBLOCH S, 2003, DOI 10.2466/pr0.93.7.653-658; KRAUT R, 1998, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.53.9.1017; KUBEY R, 2002, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican0202-74; KUSS D, 2014, DOI 10.2174/13816128113199990617; KUSS D, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.04.002; KWON M, 2013, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0083558; LAROSE R, 2003, DOI 10.1207/s1532785xmep0503_01; LAROSE R, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2010.01360.x; LEUNG L, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0894439311435217; LEWIS J, 2005, DOI 10.1080/0308514042000329342; LING R, 2016, DOI 10.5210/fm.v21i9.6814; MEIER A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.011; MULLER H, 2003; NALDINI M, 2004; NANSEN B, 2012, DOI 10.1080/17482798.2011.619548; OFCOM, 2016; OPHIR E, 2009, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0903620106; PANEK E, 2012; PANEK E, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0093650213499657; PARK S, 2008; PENARD T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.08.004; PRZYBYLSKI A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.02.014; REINECKE L, 2017, DOI 10.1080/15213269.2015.1121832; REINECKE L, 2018, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0205384; REINECKE L, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816675437; RIGBY C, 2017; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROSSEEL Y, 2012, DOI 10.18637/jss.v048.i02; SALO M, 2017; SCHROEDER R, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813495157; SCOTT S, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s12888-015-0497-7; SPADA M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.09.007; SPARKS C, 2013, DOI 10.1080/13183222.2013.11009113; STEPHENS K, 2017, DOI 10.1111/comt.12116; STRATTON M, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1548051809350893; SUTTON T, 2017, DOI 10.5210/fm.v22i6.7561; TARAFDAR M, 2015; THATCHER A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2007.10.008; TOKUNAGA R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/23808985.2015.11679174; TOKUNAGA R, 2016, DOI 10.1111/hcre.12075; VALKENBURG P, 2007, DOI 10.1037/0012-1649.43.2.267; VAN DER SCHUUR W, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.06.035; VAN DIJK J, 2014; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VOHS K, 2000, DOI 10.1111/1467-9280.00250; WANG J, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0894439317721981; WITTE J, 2010; YELLOWLEES P, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2005.05.004; YEYKELIS L, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12070; ZICKUHR, 2015; ZUCKERMAN M, 2009",25,2021,COMPUTER SCIENCE; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000605953800001,ISI,UNIV MILANO BICOCCA;UNIV ZURICH;UNIV ZURICH,UNIV MILANO BICOCCA,NA,"GUI MR, 2021, SOC SCI COMPUT REV","GUI MR, 2021, SOC SCI COMPUT REV",ITALY;SWITZERLAND;SWITZERLAND,10.1177/0894439319851163,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,NA,WOS

WE INVESTIGATE INDEPENDENT OWN-ACCOUNT WORKERS (IOA), SELF-EMPLOYED WITH EMPLOYEES (SEWE) AND DEPENDENT SELF-EMPLOYED WORKERS (DSEW). USING RECENT SURVEY DATA FOR 35 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT EARNINGS RISE WITH THE LEVEL OF ICT USE BUT ONLY FROM A THRESHOLD OF UTILISATION ACCOUNTING FOR AT LEAST 25 PER CENT OF THE TIME.

A 'BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE' (BYOD) INITIATIVE CALLED FOR A STRONGER CONNECT WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IN FORMAL EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS IN 2012. THIS WAS INDEED MUCH AHEAD OF ITS TIME, AS NOW EVIDENT FROM WORLDWIDE MOVE TOWARDS DIGITAL EDUCATION IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IN THIS STUDY, WE TRACKED TRANSFORMATIONS WITHIN LEARNING AND TEACHING FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. AT THE INCEPTION OF THE IDEA, THERE WAS MUCH RESISTANCE FROM PARENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS; HOWEVER, THE BYOD INITIATIVE ULTIMATELY SHOWCASED A VERY SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLE OF TECHNOLOGY-SUPPORTED TEACHING AND LEARNING INITIATIVE FOR OTHER NEW ZEALAND SCHOOLS. OUR INVESTIGATION PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE CRITICAL INDICATORS FOR THE SUCCESS OF SUCH AN INITIATIVE, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF ATTENTION AND DIALOGUE THIS BYOD TOPIC GATHERED ACROSS NEW ZEALAND. INITIAL DISCOURSES (OVER NEWSPAPERS, RADIO AND TELEVISION) SUGGESTED THAT THIS INITIATIVE WOULD BE DAMAGING IN VIEW OF EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDES ACROSS SOCIETIES AND THE OVERALL PUBLIC OPINION OUTWEIGHED THE POTENTIAL POSITIVES FROM SUCH AN INITIATIVE. AS PART OF OUR FIVE-YEAR STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED SOME OF THE KEY CONCERNS AROUND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF SUCH A TECHNOLOGY-SUPPORTED LEARNING INITIATIVE. ONE OF THE KEY ENABLERS OF THIS STUDY WAS INTEGRATION OF TWO FRAMEWORKS, TO ENABLE THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIOUS SOURCES OF SOCIAL COGNITIVE ABILITIES RELATED TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S INFORMATION LITERACY, MOTIVATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL ASPECTS. THAT IS, HOW SKILL DEVELOPMENT, KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION, AND CHANGES IN PERSONAL AND BEHAVIORAL ASPECTS IMPACT SELF-EFFICACY LEVELS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF BYOD STRATEGIES. THE RESULTING FRAMEWORK IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT IN POST-COVID-19 TIMES, SINCE TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN REMOTE EDUCATION DELIVERY FORMATS ARE NOW BEING TOUTED AS THE NEW NORM. OUR FRAMEWORK WILL THEREFORE PROVIDE MUCH VALUE TO POLICY-MAKERS IN ESTABLISHING INCLUSIVE EDUCATIONAL POLICIES.","QUEENS UNIV BELFAST, SCH ELECRON ELECT ENGN & COMP SCI, BELFAST, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND.;  MASSEY UNIV, SCH MATH & COMPUTAT SCI, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND.","ADHIKARI, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), QUEENS UNIV BELFAST, SCH ELECRON ELECT ENGN & COMP SCI, BELFAST, ANTRIM, NORTH IRELAND.","ADHIKARI J, 2017; ADHIKARI J, 2017, DOI 10.1108/ijilt-04-2017-0022; ADHIKARI J, 2016, DOI 10.1108/itse-04-2016-0007; BAILEY J, 2012; BENBASAT I, 1987, DOI 10.2307/248684; BRANDTZAEG P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.11.004; BROSNAN M, 1998, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2729.1998.143059.x; CRISTOL D, 2013, DOI 10.5339/qproc.2013.mlearn.15; DUBE L, 2003; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; LENHART A, 2003; MARDIS M, 2013; MATHRANI A, 2022, DOI 10.1080/14767724.2021.1981253; NEWHOUSE P, 2014; PACHLER N, 2010, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0585-7; PACHLER N, 2010, DOI 10.4018/jmbl.2010010101; PARTRIDGE H, 2003; RIVERS J, 2004; SAMPSON D G, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-02264-2_1; SANGANI K, 2013, DOI 10.1049/et.2013.0304; SCHWARTZMAN R, 2020, DOI 10.1080/03634523.2020.1804602; SHARPLES M, 2002, DOI 10.1504/ijceell.2002.002148; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WILLIAMSON B, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2020.1761641; YIN R K, 2003; ZHONG Z, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.10.016",0,2021,COMPUTER SCIENCE; ENGINEERING,WOS:000800254200026,ISI,QUEENS UNIV BELFAST;MASSEY UNIV,QUEENS UNIV BELFAST,NA,"ADHIKARI J, 2021, NA","ADHIKARI J, 2021, NA",IRELAND;NEW ZEALAND,10.1109/csde53843.2021.9718393,978-1-6654-9552-3,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE; COMPUTER SCIENCE, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; ENGINEERING, BIOMEDICAL",0,IEEE,NA,WOS

IN THIS CONTEXT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS LINKED WITH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CAN BE RELEVANT. THIS GAP IS SHOWN NOT ONLY IN THE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES, BUT ALSO IN THE COMPETENCES DERIVED FROM THEIR USAGE AND USEFULNESS. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THIS DIVIDE IN AN ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUP. THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE VALIDITY DATA OF THE MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENT VALORA 1001, DESIGNED THE EXPERT GROUP OF THE SOCIAL INCLUSION OBSERVATORY OF LEON CITY, ARE EXPOSED. THE INFORMATION FROM A SAMPLE OF 1.125 PEOPLE IN SITUATION OF SOCIAL VULNERABILITY WAS ANALYSED. THE RESULTS, WHEN COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE VALUES AT A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL, SHOWED THE EXISTENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL DIVIDE, PLACING THIS POPULATION GROUP AT RISK OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION DEALING WITH ACCESS (AVAILABILITY OF TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET) AS MUCH AS USAGE (USE FOR JOB SEARCH AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES).

HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE BENEFITS OF DIGITALIZATION, INDIVIDUALS NEED TO HAVE THE NECESSARY SKILLS. SENIORS REPRESENT A GROUP THAT, COMPARED TO OTHER GROUPS, LIVES IN A DIGITAL EXCLUSION TO AN EXCESSIVE EXTENT, MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY LACK THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE TO USE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL SERVICES. BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED FROM SENIORS PARTAKING IN DIGITAL TRAINING, WE HAVE ANALYZED THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF WHY THEY AND OTHER SENIORS ARE DIGITALLY EXCLUDED. OUR FINDINGS POINT OUT THAT A MAJOR BARRIER FOR SENIORS TO BE MORE DIGITALLY INCLUDED IS DIFFERENT VARIANTS OF FEAR OF USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL SERVICES. THE COMMON DENOMINATOR CAN BE TRACED DOWN THE POSSIBILITIES TO BE EXPOSED TO FRAUDS, SCAMS, VIRUSES, AND FAULTY HANDLING, WHICH IN TURN CAUSE UNDESIRED CONSEQUENCES.

SECOND, PREEXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDES EVEN WITHIN WELL-CONNECTED CITIES HAVE TRANSLATED INTO INEQUALITIES IN PREPAREDNESS FOR LIVING THROUGH THE LOCKDOWN, BUT DIGITALIZATION STRATEGIES CAN ENHANCE EQUITY IN ACCESS TO E-SERVICES, ONLINE WORK AND EDUCATION FOR ALL IN THE FUTURE.

SOC.,ARTICLE,21ST CENTURY SKILLS; DIGITAL LITERACY; DIGITAL COMPETENCE; ICT; EDUCATION; DIGITAL DIVIDE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS),NA,"INTRODUCTION: FACED WITH AN IMMINENT DIGITAL ERA MARKED BY GLOBALIZATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS RAISED THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATING EDUCATION WITH THE SO-CALLED 21ST CENTURY COMPETENCIES. THE NEED FOR NEW SKILLS TO PARTICIPATE IN DIGITAL CULTURE IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS, WHERE DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS KEY AND FUNDAMENTAL TO LIVE, WORK AND PARTICIPATE IN KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY. METHODOLOGY: THIS WORK AIMS TO GENERATE AN INTEGRATED PROPOSAL OF DIGITAL LITERACY THROUGH A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN EIGHT FRAMEWORKS OF 21ST CENTURY SKILLS (ATCS, ENGAUGE, NAEP, NETS, OECD, P21, UNESCO, EUROPEAN UNION), WHICH THEY ARE STUDIED IN THREE MAIN THEMATIC BLOCKS: A) DEFINITION, B) OBJECTIVES AND VISION, C) COMPETENCES AND ABILITIES. RESULTS: DIGITAL LITERACY ENCOMPASSES A HOLISTIC APPROACH, NURTURED BY DIFFERENT LITERACIES, FROM WHICH A META-FRAMEWORK WITH NINE COMPETENCIES IS BUILT: THREE DIRECT COMPETENCIES, 1) INFORMATION AND DATA, 2) COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, AND 3) TECHNICAL; FIVE TRANSVERSAL COMPETENCES, 4) PROBLEM SOLVING, 5) GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP AND MULTICULTURAL AWARENESS, 6) INTERPERSONAL, 7) FUTURE THINKING, 8) CREATIVE THINKING AND 9) CRITICAL THINKING; AND 53 COGNITIVE, CRITICAL, TECHNICAL, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL AND PROJECTIVE DIGITAL SKILLS. CONCLUSIONS: MULTIDIMENSIONAL DIGITAL LITERACY CONSOLIDATES THE TECHNO-SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE FOR EMPOWERMENT AND TECHNOLOGICAL APPROPRIATION, WHICH EXCEEDS THE OPERATIONAL USE OF TOOLS AND GUARANTEES THE BROAD, MEANINGFUL AND INNOVATIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN EQUITABLE SOCIETY, DECENT EMPLOYMENT, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AMONG OTHER PURPOSES THAT ARE CONNECTED WITH THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.","UNIV NAVARRA, COMUNICAC, PAMPLONA, SPAIN.;  UNIV NAVARRA, FAC COMUNICAC, PAMPLONA, SPAIN.","BRAVO, MCM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV NAVARRA, COMUNICAC, PAMPLONA, SPAIN.","ALA-MUTKA K, 2007; ANANIADOU K, 2009; BUSQUET-DURAN J, 2013, DOI 10.14198/medcom2013.4.2.06; CARBALLO M, 2018, DOI 10.15581/003.31.4.121-134; CHU S, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-2481-8_2; CORTONI I, 2015; COVENTRY L, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.maturitas.2018.04.008; DEDE C, 2010; ESTEVE-MON F, 2015; FERRARI A, 2014; FERRARI A, 2012; FERRES J, 2018, DOI 10.1186/s41239-018-0097-y; FRANGANILLO J, 2020, DOI 10.3145/thinkepi.2020.e14f02; GARCIA-PEREZ L, 2021, DOI 10.3390/educsci11010027; GOMEZ DIAZ DE LEON C, 2014; MARTIN A, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c38-2012-02-03; ILOMAKI L, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10639-014-9346-4; JENKINS H, 2008; LANG B, 2021, DOI 10.1108/josm-05-2020-0155; MARTINEZ-BRAVO M, 2020; MARTINEZ-BRAVO M, 2020, DOI 10.3145/epi.2020.jul.28; MESHCHERYAKOVA M A, 2020, DOI 10.20914/2310-1202-2020-3-279-283; MORENO A, 2019; MOYA OTERO J, 2010; NEW MEDIA C, 2017; PANGRAZIO L, 2021, DOI 10.7821/naer.2021.1.616; PEDRIOLI C A, 2020; PEREZ-ESCODA A, 2019, DOI 10.1080/11356405.2019.1603274; PORCELLI A, 2020, DOI 10.46661/lexsocial.5078; REIG HERNANDEZ D, 2016; RHEINGOLD H, 1996; RIBERO M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.12.001; SALAVERRIA R, 2020, DOI 10.3145/epi.2020.may.15; SHEK D T L, 2015, DOI 10.1515/ijdhd-2015-0407; SIDDIQ F, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.014; TOFFLER A, 1980; TRUJILLO SEGOVIANO J, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DEURSEN A, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.10.005; VAN LAAR E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010; VILLANUEVA C, 2021, DOI 10.15581/003.34.2.449-468; VILLAROEL G, 2001; VOOGT J, 2012, DOI 10.1080/00220272.2012.668938",4,2021,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000751501800014,ISI,UNIV NAVARRA;UNIV NAVARRA,UNIV NAVARRA,NA,"BRAVO MCM, 2021, REV LAT COMUN SOC","BRAVO MCM, 2021, REV LAT COMUN SOC",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.4185/rlcs-2021-1508,NA,COMMUNICATION,4,LABORATORIO TECNOLOGIAS INFORMACION & NUEVOS ANALISIS COMUNICACION SOCIAL,NA,WOS

THE REASON MORE FOR TAKING THE E-INCLUSION OF ALL SOCIAL GROUPS AS A CHALLENGE HAS RECENTLY BEEN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND NATURAL DISASTERS (EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS) THAT CHANGE THE NORMS OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR, REQUIRE ADAPTATION AND CREATE NEW RULES. USERS' ABILITY TO USE DIGITAL SERVICES AND GOODS AS WELL AS OPEN DATA PROVIDED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN GREATER ACCESS TO RELEVANT INFORMATION AS WELL AS IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE AND ARE A KEY FACTOR FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND THE ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF INVESTING IN ADVANCED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, GOODS AND SERVICES. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MANIFESTS ITSELF ON CERTAIN SOCIAL GROUPS, WHICH IS A SOCIAL PROBLEM. HOWEVER, DESPITE THESE INITIATIVES, THERE ARE STILL LIMITATIONS THAT PREVENT CERTAIN POPULATION GROUPS FROM BECOMING E-INCLUSIVE MEMBERS OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE IN WHICH SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL PAPERS CONSIDER THE CONCEPTS OF E-INCLUSION AND DIGITAL DIVIDE AS A CHALLENGE. THE MULTIPERSPECTIVENESS AND MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF THE CONCEPT OF E-INCLUSION INDICATES ITS SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY.","UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ORG & INFORMAT, VARAZHDIN, CROATIA.","ZDJELAR, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ORG & INFORMAT, VARAZHDIN, CROATIA.","ABAD ALCALA L, 2014, DOI 10.3916/c42-2014-17; ACTUA, 2015; BINDE J, 2005; DEWAN S, 2005; EPSTEIN D, 2011, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2011.548695; ESHETALKALAI Y, 2004; EUROPEAN CENTRAL B, EC B; EUROPEAN C, 2015; EVANGELISTA R, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10438599.2014.918438; GONZALEZ A, 2012, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2011.595314; GROM S, 2016; HARGITTAI E, 2001; HERNANDEZ-ENCUENTRA E, 2009, DOI 10.1080/03601270802466934; HRUSTEK N Z, 2015; HUESING T, 2002; JUDGE S, 2006, DOI 10.3200/joer.100.1.52-60; KAESS M, 2021, DOI 10.1111/jcpp.13317; KOLESNICHENKO O, 2020; LI Y, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.01053.x; MANCINELLI E, 2008; MEDEIROS B, 2020, DOI 10.1590/0034-761220200207; MEHTA D, 2020, DOI 10.1108/dlp-05-2020-0030; MENDONCA S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.12.010; MEYER I, 2006; MINNAMARI N, 2009, DOI 10.1109/fie.2009.5350544; MOLNAR S, 2003; MORDINI E, 2009; NAEGELE G, 2011; NEGREIRO M, 2015; NORRIS P, 2001; NT I, 1998; PADILLA-GONGORA D, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2017.02.206; PETRAUSKAS R, 2008; RATHMAN L, 2013; READER S, 2015; SHARMA R, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.05.003; SILVA P, 2017, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0184545; SIREN A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/08959420.2016.1187036; STATE OF M, 2014; TSEKEA S, 2021, DOI 10.1108/dlp-06-2020-0058; UNITED N, 2015; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2007; VAN DIJK J, 1999; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WAKE D, 2020, DOI 10.1530/eje-20-0377; WALKER A Z A, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10272-016-0592-0; WARSCHAUER M, 2000; WARSCHAUER M, 2004, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001; XIE B, 2007, DOI 10.1080/03601270701252872; YU B, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jd-10-2017-0148; ZHAO L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.05.010",2,2021,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000744206100009,ISI,UNIV ZAGREB,UNIV ZAGREB,NA,"ZDJELAR R, 2021, J INF ORGAN SCI","ZDJELAR R, 2021, J INF ORGAN SCI",CROATIA,10.31341/jios.45.2.14,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS",2,"UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ORGANIZATION & INFORMATICS",EUROPEAN UNION'S HORIZON 2020 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME [857592 - TODO],WOS

THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF SOCIETY; THE PROBLEM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS BECOMING MORE ACUTE. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, SOCIAL GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS ARE FORCED TO ADAPT TO THE NEW SOCIAL REALITY IN A FAIRLY LIMITED TIME. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO PROVIDE AN ANALYTICAL REVIEW OF THE CURRENT MAIN DIRECTIONS AND CONCEPTS OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL ADAPTATION IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITALIZATION OF MODERN SOCIETY, AND TO DETERMINE THE ROLE OF ICT IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL ADAPTATION AND INTEGRATION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS: (1) AN ANALYTICAL REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS OF SOCIAL ADAPTATION, THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL CHANGES ON ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR, MODELS OF SOCIAL ADAPTATION, TYPES OF SOCIAL INEQUALITY, INCLUDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, AND WAYS TO OVERCOME IT; (2) SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF SOCIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL ADAPTATION AND ADAPTATION RESOURCES IN THE CONTEXT OF DIGITALIZATION OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY; (3) PROMISING DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THE PROBLEM OF THE RESEARCH IS THAT, IN THE CONDITIONS OF DIGITALIZATION OF MODERN RUSSIAN SOCIETY, A SITUATION HAS DEVELOPED WHEN ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE ELDERLY ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ADAPT TO THE NEW SOCIAL REALITY, WHICH LEADS TO THE SOCIAL EXCLUSION OF THIS SOCIAL GROUP. THAT IS WHY THE PROBLEM FIELD OF THE RESEARCH WAS FORMED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ANALYSIS OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL ADAPTATION IN THE CONDITIONS OF MODERN SOCIETY'S DIGITALIZATION AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE ROLE OF ICT IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL ADAPTATION AND INTEGRATION. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT MODERN RUSSIAN SOCIETY IS EXPERIENCING DIGITAL INEQUALITY CAUSED BY BOTH OBJECTIVE (FORMED BY THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT: THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ICT TOOLS) AND SUBJECTIVE (DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL: MOTIVATION TO USE AND MASTER ICT, DIGITAL COMPETENCE) PARAMETERS. DIGITAL INEQUALITY IS A FACTOR IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. THE AUTHORS EMPHASIZE THAT OLDER PEOPLE'S INTEGRATION INTO MODERN SOCIETY AND SOCIAL ADAPTATION TO IT ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE USE OF SUCH AN ADAPTATION RESOURCE AS ICT. THE KNOWLEDGE AND INTENSITY OF USE OF ICT BY THE ELDERLY ARE INDICATORS OF OLDER PEOPLE'S SOCIAL ADAPTABILITY IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY.","PENZA STATE UNIV, PENZA, RUSSIA.","SHCHANINA, EV (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), PENZA STATE UNIV, PENZA, RUSSIA.","BELYAEVA L, 2001; BIKKULOV, 2018, DOI 10.17586/2587-8557-2018-2-131-137; BUDAEV, 2020, DOI 10.15688/re.volsu.2020.4.10; DOBRINSKAYA D, 2019, DOI 10.22363/2313-2272-2019-19-1-108-120; DUDCHENKO O, 2020, DOI 10.19181/ezheg; ERMAKOVA N, 2016; GASUMOVA S, 2016, DOI 10.17072/2078-7898/2016-3-161-171; GOLENKOVA Z, 2018, DOI 10.19181/monograph.2019.1; HARGITTAI E, 2001; KANOV V, 2014; KOREL L, 2005; KORNILOVA M, 2018, DOI 10.31171/vlast.v26i6.5891; KOZYREVA P, 2021, DOI 10.19181/rlms-hse.2021; KURYACHEVA M, 2018; MAKHROVA, 2020; MOSKVINA N, 2020; NGUYEN M, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s12289-020-01581-w; NIZOMUTDINOV, 2014; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.30547/worldofmedia.4.2018.1; SHABANOVA M, 2001; SHAPOSHNIK S, 2012; SHCHANINA, 2017, DOI 10.21685/2072-3016-2017-2-14; SOLDATOVA G, 2016; TIKHONOVA N, 2016; TRONIN V, 2020; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VARTANOVA E, 2021, DOI 10.30547/vestnik.journ.1.2021.329; YASTREBOV G, 2007; YU V, 2021, DOI 10.31857/s013216250012083-4",0,2021,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000730279500013,ISI,PENZA STATE UNIV,PENZA STATE UNIV,NA,"SHCHANINA EV, 2021, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA","SHCHANINA EV, 2021, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA",RUSSIA,10.17223/1998863x/63/13,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,RUSSIAN FOUNDATION FOR BASIC RESEARCH [20-111-50246],WOS

FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE PAPER RESEARCHES THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND SOCIAL INCLUSION, DIGITAL DIVIDE AND DIGITAL INCLUSION. FURTHERMORE, THE ROLE OF CRITICAL INFORMATION LITERACY IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AND THE SO-CALLED PLATFORM SOCIETY IS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION; AND THE ROLE OF LIBRARIES IN PRIVACY LITERACY IS INDICATED, WITH THE AIM OF REDUCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND INCREASING DIGITAL INCLUSION. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES TO THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY, AND EXCLUSION FROM THE INFORMATION SOCIETY IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM. THE PAPER EXPLAINS THAT LIBRARIES ARE SUITABLE PLACES TO COMBAT SOCIAL ISOLATION AND THAT THEY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN STRENGTHENING SOCIAL COHESION. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WITH LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION, AS WELL AS THOSE WITH LOWER INCOMES, ARE MORE AT RISK OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION, WHILE HELP IN GETTING OUT OF SUCH A PROBLEM CAN BE FOUND IN PRIVACY LITERACY.","NATL & UNIV LIB ZAGREB, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  UNIV ZAGREB, DEPT INFORMAT & COMMUN SCI, FAC HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCI, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","KATULIC, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NATL & UNIV LIB ZAGREB, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","AABO V, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0961000605057855; BAWDEN D, 2022; BENNETT J, 2011; PRADO J, 2013, DOI 10.1515/libri-2013-0010; CARMI E, 2020, DOI 10.14763/2020.2.1474; CHARLESON D, 2012, DOI 10.36251/josi.52; DIJK, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; DRAGICEVIC, 2015; ELMBORG J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.acalib.2005.12.004; FOSTER C, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0961000612448592; FROEHLICH, 2004; GIVENS C, 2015; GORMAN M, 2000; GORMAN M, 2006; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HEEKS R, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1599039; HOFFMAN D L, 2000; HORVAT, 2004; JAEGER P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2012.654728; JOHANSSON V, 2017; KOLTAY T, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0961000615616450; KRONAUER M, 1998; LANGENDERFER J, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-6606.2009.01152.x; LAU J, 2011; LIVINGSTONE S, 2018; MARINKOVIC-ZENIC I, 2007; MCMENEMY D, 2005; PANGRAZIO L, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818799523; PAUL G, 1974; POULTER, 2005; POULTER A, 2005; ROTMAN, 2009; SANDER I, 2020, DOI 10.14763/2020.2.1479; SERVON L, 2002; SETON C, 2019; SEUBERT, 2019, DOI 10.13140/rg.2.2.12708.01926; SOLOVE D, 2006, DOI 10.2307/40041279; SPIRANEC, 2018; SPIRANEC S, 2008; SPIRANEC S, 2019; SRNICEK N, 2017; SUCUR, 1997; SUCUR Z, 2004; SUCUR Z, 1995; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VAN DIJK J, 2017, DOI 10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0043; VITAK J, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3274445; WILLIAMS T, 2011; WISSINGER C, 2017, DOI 10.15760/comminfolit.2017.11.2.9; WU P, 2020, DOI 10.1002/asi.24232; XU F, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s10660-013-9111-6",0,2021,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000729778600002,ISI,NATL AND UNIV LIB ZAGREB;UNIV ZAGREB,NATL AND UNIV LIB ZAGREB,NA,"KATULIC A, 2021, BOSNIACA","KATULIC A, 2021, BOSNIACA",CROATIA;CROATIA,10.37083/bosn.2021.26.9,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,0,NATL & UNIV LIBRARY BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA,NA,WOS

ON THE OTHER HAND, THOSE MOST RELUCTANT TO VIRTUALIZATION OF PURCHASES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY BEING SUBJECTED TO A DOUBLE DIGITAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIVIDE.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIOL METODOL & TEORIA, MADRID, SPAIN.;  UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIOL METODOL & TEORIA, FAC CIENCIAS INFORMAC, MADRID, SPAIN.","HERNANDEZ-FERNANDEZ, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIOL METODOL & TEORIA, MADRID, SPAIN.","ALONSO E, 2004; ARCE-URRIZA M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.cede.2012.07.002; BUITRAGO L, 2008; DANS E, 2002; ECHEVERRIA J, 1995; ECO U, 1965; EDUARD C F, 2011; IAB S, 2020; KARSAKLIAN E, 2012; ONTSI, 2019; PEÑA-GARCÍA N, 2018, DOI 10.15446/innovar.v28n69.71702; PRENSKY M, 2010; SEUR, 2019",0,2021,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000713345800001,ISI,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID;UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,NA,"HERNANDEZ-FERNANDEZ C, 2021, MEDIAC SOC","HERNANDEZ-FERNANDEZ C, 2021, MEDIAC SOC",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.5209/meso.75487,NA,COMMUNICATION,0,"UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",NA,WOS

FOR THIS, A REDUCED VERSION OF YESAVAGE'S GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE (GDS) IS USED AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DATA ARE COLLECTED, RELATED TO PERSONAL SITUATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTICE AND INTERNET USE THROUGH A QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED AD HOC. AFTER PERFORMING A DESCRIPTIVE AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS OF THE DATA, IT IS FOUND THAT THE VARIETY OF USES MADE OF THE INTERNET CORRELATES SIGNIFICANTLY, NEGATIVELY, WITH THE NUMBER OF RESPONSES THAT INDICATE DEPRESSION ON THE GDS SCALE (P<0.001). INTERNET APPLICATIONS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING ARE USING THE INTERNET TO READ PRESS, WATCH VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE AND PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL NETWORKS.","UNIV SEVILLE, SEVILLE, SPAIN.;  CTR STUDIES EDUC & INNOVAT, CI&DEI, IPG, ESECD, LISBON, PORTUGAL.","ROMAN-GRAVAN, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SEVILLE, SEVILLE, SPAIN.","AGUDO S, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c39-2012-03-10; AGUILAR GAVIRA S, 2018; BERMEJO-PAREJA F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.rce.2016.05.010; COTTEN S, 2014, DOI 10.1093/geronb/gbu018; DAWIDOWICZ A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2019.102575; GARCIA M A, 2002; GARCIA SERRANO M J, 2001; GOMEZ E, 2009; HEO M, 2008, DOI 10.1002/gps.2061; INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE E, 2019; INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE E, 2018; KURLOWICHZ L, 2007; LABADIE J, 2003; LIZARRAGA M C, 2006; LUCAS-MOLINA B, 2015, DOI 10.15446/rcp.v24n1.43437; MONTAA M, 2015, DOI 10.3145/epi.2015.nov.07; NACIONES U, 2002; OLIVAN B, 2011; ORTIZ-COLÓN ANA M, 2015; PASCUAL M A, 2008; PEREZ-ALBENIZ A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.aula.2014.06.002; PLAISIER I, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2006.09.008; PORTELLANO-ORTIZ C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.rpsm.2016.10.003; RODRIGUEZ-BOBADA J, 2012; SEGURA-CARDONA A, 2015, DOI 10.15446/rsap.v17n2.41295; SMALL G, 2009, DOI 10.1097/jgp.0b013e3181953a02; SOBOCKI P, 2006; TORIJA J, 2007, DOI 10.1157/13099119; VINARAS-ABAD M, 2017, DOI 10.4185/rlcs-2017-1161; WHOQOL G, 1996; ZHAO K, 2012, DOI 10.1017/s1092852912000533; ZHU Y, 2019, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2019.1662933",3,2021,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000644474600006,ISI,UNIV SEVILLE;CTR STUDIES EDUC AND INNOVAT,UNIV SEVILLE,NA,"ROMAN-GRAVAN P, 2021, PIXEL-BIT","ROMAN-GRAVAN P, 2021, PIXEL-BIT",PORTUGAL;SPAIN,10.12795/pixelbit.76963,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,3,"UNIV SEVILLA, EDITORIAL",NA,WOS

THE KEY APPROACHES TO THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THIS CONCEPT THROUGH THE PRISM OF SOCIOECONOMIC AND GENERATIONAL APPROACHES IN FOREIGN AND RUSSIAN RESEARCH DISCOURSE ARE CONSIDERED. THERE IS A LACK OF APPROACHES TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE FEATURES OF SOCIAL NETWORK BEHAVIOR OF DIGITAL AND PRE-DIGITAL GENERATIONS, THEIR COOPERATION AND CONFLICT IN THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. A NEW CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE DIGITAL GENERATIONAL DIVIDE IS PROPOSED AS A DYNAMIC UNITY OF NETWORK COMMUNICATION COOPERATION (WITH ELEMENTS OF MENTORING AND PATRONIZING FROM THE YOUNGER ONES WITHIN FAMILY COMMUNITIES) AND NETWORK CONFLICT ISOLATION (BASED ON VOLUNTARY SOCIAL PLATFORM SEGREGATION). BASED ON THE ASSESSMENTS AND OPINIONS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DIGITAL GENERATION, IDENTIFIED AS A RESULT OF A SERIES OF FIELD STUDIES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A RESEARCH PROJECT DEDICATED TO THE STUDY OF THE NETWORK CULTURE OF THE DIGITAL GENERATION, GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE PROFILES OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED, THE MECHANISMS OF DIGITAL LITERACY TRANSMISSION AND PLATFORM ADJUSTMENT ARE ANALYZED AS MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DIGITAL GENERATIONAL DIVIDE. IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A HIGH SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES ON THE PART OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND CRITICALITY IN RELATION TO THEIR DIGITAL SKILLS OF ELDERS, THE PRESENCE OF A SUBJECTIVE AWARENESS OF THE DIGITAL INTERGENERATIONAL GAP ON THE PART OF THE RESPONDENTS. BASED ON THE METHOD OF MIRROR MUTUAL ASSESSMENT BY REPRESENTATIVES OF DIGITAL/PRE-DIGITAL GENERATIONS OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES AND USER BEHAVIOR OF EACH OTHER, THE CORRESPONDING COMPETENCE DEFICITS OF EACH GENERATION ARE IDENTIFIED. THE EXTRA-INSTITUTIONAL NATURE OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK CYBER SOCIALIZATION IS DETERMINED, WHEN ITS KEY AGENTS ARE PEERS AND BLOGGERS, RATHER THAN PARENTS AND TEACHERS. WITH REGARD TO THE BROADCAST OF DIGITAL SKILLS, THE PHENOMENON OF ""REVERSE MENTORING"" AND THE PRACTICE OF ""DIGITAL PATRONIZING/DEPENDENCE"" ARE DESCRIBED, WHEN GRANDCHILDREN AND CHILDREN LEAD THEIR PERSONAL ACCOUNTS FOR THE ELDERLY AND CARRY OUT ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. PARTIAL PLATFORM INTERGENERATIONAL VOLUNTARY SEGREGATION IS ANALYZED AS A TREND OF ""COMMUNICATIVE FASHION"", A WAY OF COMMUNICATIVE DETACHMENT FROM ELDERS AND A MANIFESTATION OF THE GENERATIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE.","TOMSK STATE UNIV, TOMSK, RUSSIA.","GLUKHOV, AP (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TOMSK STATE UNIV, TOMSK, RUSSIA.","GIANCOLA F, 2006; MIZUKO I, 2010; OKUSHOVA G, 2019; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424843; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57",0,2021,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000640894400014,ISI,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK STATE UNIV,NA,"GLUKHOV AP, 2021, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA","GLUKHOV AP, 2021, VESTN TOMSK GOS UNIV FILOS-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA",RUSSIA,10.17223/1998863x/59/14,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,NA,WOS

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE HAD GREAT SIGNIFICANCE IN THIS PROCESS. THIS TECHNOLOGY-MEDIATED LEARNING HAS HAD RELEVANT CONSEQUENCES REGARDING HOW TEACHERS GIVE THEIR LESSONS, HOW STUDENTS INTERACT IN THAT CONTEXT, AND HOW SCHOOL TASKS ARE CARRIED OUT. THE DIFFERENCE IN STUDENT ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGIES HAS HAD IMPLICATIONS, ONE OF THEM BEING THE WIDENING OF THE SOCIAL GAP. AND FROM THIS SITUATION WE MUST LEARN ABOUT A SERIES OF VARIABLES THAT HAVE MADE THE PROCESS DIFFICULT: THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS IN TERMS OF THEIR DIGITAL SKILLS, THE SIGNIFICANCE ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES, THE NEED TO MAKE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS TO AVOID A DEEPENING OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, AND THE NEED TO TRANSFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF THE TEACHER AS WELL AS THE CONCEPTION OF THE TEACHING-LEARNING PROCESS.

MOTIVATED BY INNOVATION-DIFFUSION, COMPETENCE-BASED AND SKILL-BIASED TECHNICAL CHANGE THEORIES, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ALL DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES' INNOVATIONS MUST BE SUPPORTED BY DEMAND FOR RELATED SKILLS AND SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO AN INNOVATION CYCLE. THIS RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED USING A VAST DATASET OF 1000 LARGE RUSSIAN FIRMS OBSERVED OVER TEN YEARS, WITH INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OPEN INTERNET-BASED SOURCES AND PROCESSED THROUGH CONTENT ANALYSIS. AMONG THE KEY FINDINGS, THE DIGITAL-INNOVATION CYCLE HAS BEEN EXPLORED AND VISUALIZED, BY IDENTIFYING THE MOST PROBABLE PERIOD OF THESE INNOVATIONS AND THEIR FURTHER DIFFUSION. THE DIGITAL-DIVIDE CONCEPT HAS BEEN EXPLICATED BY EXAMINING DATA ON THE RELATIVE DYNAMICS OF DIGITAL SKILLS DEMANDED BY THE SAME COMPANIES DURING THE PERIOD OF INVESTIGATION. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS DELIVER AN INTERESTING INSIGHT AND ENCOURAGE US TO RETHINK THE CORPORATE DIGITAL DIVIDE THROUGH CAUSALITY BETWEEN COMPETENCY ACCUMULATION AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFTS. THAT, IN TURN, IDENTIFIES THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE PREDICTION OF DEMAND SHOCKS IN RELATION TO DIGITAL COMPETENCIES IN LABOR MARKETS.","NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON, INT LAB INTANGIBLE DRIVEN ECON, KANTEMIROVSKAYA 3-1,209, ST PETERSBURG 194100, RUSSIA.;  NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON, INT LAB INTANGIBLE DRIVEN ECON, 27 LEBEDEVA ST, PERM 614017, RUSSIA.","PARSHAKOV, P (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON, INT LAB INTANGIBLE DRIVEN ECON, 27 LEBEDEVA ST, PERM 614017, RUSSIA.","ABEYSEKERA I, 2006, DOI 10.1108/14691930610639778; ACEMOGLU D, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555838; ANDERSON M, 2006, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1060.0542; ANTONELLI C, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(02)00093-8; ARNAL E, 2003; ARVANITIS S, 2001, DOI 10.1080/10438590100000015; ARVANITIS S, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1043859042000226257; ARVANITIS S, 2015, DOI 10.1093/icc/dtv008; AUTOR D, 2003, DOI 10.1162/003355303322552801; BACH M, 2013, DOI 10.12821/ijispm010403; BARTEL A, 1987, DOI 10.2307/1937894; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BERMAN E, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555892; BERNDT E R, 1992, DOI 10.3386/w4010; BORGHANS L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2010.493138; BRESNAHAN T, 2002, DOI 10.1162/003355302753399526; BRESNAHAN T, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01598-t; BRYNJOLFSSON E, 2010; CARD D, 2001, DOI 10.1162/00335530151144140; CAROLI E, 2001, DOI 10.1162/003355301753265624; CILAN C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.11.002; COZZARIN B, 2006, DOI 10.1080/10438590500222691; DOMS M, 1997, DOI 10.1162/003355397555181; DRISKO J W, 2015, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190215491.001.0001; DUMAY J, 2014, DOI 10.1108/jic-01-2014-0010; FALK M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/01437720110386421; FRANCALANCI C, 1998, DOI 10.2307/249396; GAUR A, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2017.11.003; GOLDIN C, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555720; GREENWOOD J, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0167-2231(97)00004-3; LAMBERTON C, 2016, DOI 10.1509/jm.15.0415; LE DEIST F, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1367886042000338227; LIAO H, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2016.05.001; LOVE I, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.qref.2005.11.007; MACHIN S, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555883; MAGGI B, 2019, DOI 10.1080/10438599.2018.1483485; MAKRI M, 2010, DOI 10.1002/smj.829; MILGROM P, 1991; MILGROM P, 1990; MILGROM P, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0165-4101(94)00382-f; NAIDENOVA I, 2013, DOI 10.1108/jic-01-2013-0011; NASUTION MAHYUDDIN K, 2012; PARSHAKOV P, 2020, DOI 10.1108/jic-03-2019-0040; PFAFF B, 2008; RINDFLEISCH A, 2017, DOI 10.1111/jpim.12402; ROGERS E M, 2010; SANCHEZ R, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0148-2963(02)00318-1; SHELLEY M, 1984, DOI 10.2307/2288384; SIMS C, 1980, DOI 10.2307/1912017; SOUZA CESAR ALEXANDRE D, 2017, DOI 10.1590/1678-69712017/administracao.v18n2p15-48; STERN S, 1998; SUMATHI M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-1882-5_17; THELWALL M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.joi.2011.10.002; TODD P, 1995, DOI 10.2307/249709; VALENTE T W, 1995, DOI 10.1177/1075547095016003002; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VARALLYAI L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/s2212-5671(15)00037-4; VEUGELERS R, 2019; VIERU D, 2015, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2015.557; WILKINSON D, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.lisr.2013.04.006; YOO Y, 2010; YU L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0961000606070600; ZHU K, 2004, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2004.11045794",21,2021,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION,WOS:000621378100020,ISI,NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON;NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON,NATL RES UNIV HIGHER SCH ECON,NA,"SHAKINA E, 2021, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC CHANG","SHAKINA E, 2021, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC CHANG",RUSSIA;RUSSIA,10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120405,NA,BUSINESS; REGIONAL & URBAN PLANNING,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NA,WOS

POLICY,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL GAPS; INTERNET SERVICES; INDIVIDUAL PANEL DATA; DYNAMIC PANEL DATA MODEL,NA,"DIGITAL GAPS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO EXACERBATE THE INEQUALITIES THAT EXIST IN SOCIETY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO STUDY THE GAPS THAT OCCUR IN THE USE OF INTERNET SERVICES BY HOUSEHOLDS IN SPAIN DURING THE PERIOD 2007-2019 AND TO BECOME USEFUL IN THE DESIGN OF POLICIES ADDRESSED TO NARROW SPECIFIC DIGITAL DIVIDES. THE DATA IS A PANEL OBTAINED FROM THE ICT-H SURVEY ON HOUSEHOLDS OF THE NATIONAL STATISTICS INSTITUTE. THIS PAPER DEFINES THE GAPS AS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF INTERNET SERVICES ACROSS INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. A SELECTED GROUP OF TWELVE DIGITAL SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED: E-COMMERCE, E-SELLING, E-TOURISM, E-LEARNING, E-HEALTH, E-BANKING, E-GOVERNMENT, VOIP, CHAT, EMAIL, CLOUD SERVICES, AND SOCIAL NETWORKS. THE SECOND LEVEL DIGITAL GAPS ARE ANALYZED IN EACH SERVICE ACCORDING TO SIX RELEVANT SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS: GENDER, AGE, EDUCATION, DIGITAL SKILLS, POPULATION SIZE, AND INCOME. A SET OF GRAPHS SHOW THE EVOLUTION OF THE GAPS. GAPS ARE NARROWING IN MOST DIMENSIONS AND SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS, BUT NOT IN OTHERS SUCH AS AGE, EDUCATION, AND DIGITAL SKILLS. THE GAPS REVEAL THE EVOLUTION OF DIGITIZATION AND IN SOME CASES OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION FOR SPECIFIC GROUPS. SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIGITAL GAPS IS USEFUL FOR POLICYMAKERS, SINCE CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS AN EXPLICIT POLICY GOAL IN THIS COUNTRY, AS WELL AS IN OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE. THEN, A DYNAMIC PANEL DATA MODEL WAS PROPOSED AND ESTIMATED USING ARELLANO AND BOND TECHNIQUES. A DYNAMIC/NETWORK EFFECT WAS FOUND, AS WELL AS OTHER SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS. FINALLY, THE PAPER CONTAINS CONCLUSIONS, POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AND AN AGENDA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS CONSIST OF DIGITAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TARGETED AT THE MOST EXPOSED GROUPS SUCH AS THE ELDERLY, THE LESS WELL-EDUCATED AND PEOPLE WITH LOWER DIGITAL SKILLS.","ICAE INST COMPLUTENSE ANAL ECON, MADRID, SPAIN.;  UCM UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.;  UNED NATL UNIV DISTANCE, MADRID, SPAIN.","VALAREZO, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ICAE INST COMPLUTENSE ANAL ECON, MADRID, SPAIN.","BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; CAVA-FERRERUELA I, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.12.002; CERNO L, 2006, DOI 10.1007/3-7908-1746-5_18; DEMOUSSIS M, 2006, DOI 10.1080/10438590500216016; EUROPEAN C, 2020; EUROPEAN C, 2019; GARIN-MUNOZ T, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.01.002; HACKER K L, 2003, DOI 10.1023/a:1024968602974; HARGITTAI E, 2001; HILBERT M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.01.006; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; NISHIJIMA M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.10.004; OECD, 2001, DOI 10.1787/236405667766; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PEREZ-AMARAL T, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2019.101888; PEREZ-HERNANDEZ J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2011.03.003; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SRINUAN C, 2011; SZELES M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.007; VALAREZO A, 2020; VALAREZO A, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.03.006; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; WHITE H, 2003; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1108/itp-01-2013-0022; ZOROJA J, 2011",3,2021,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,WOS:000620636400010,ISI,ICAE INST COMPLUTENSE ANAL ECON;UCM UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID;UNED NATL UNIV DISTANCE,ICAE INST COMPLUTENSE ANAL ECON,NA,"PEREZ-AMARAL T, 2021, TELECOMMUN POLICY","PEREZ-AMARAL T, 2021, TELECOMMUN POLICY",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102093,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE; TELECOMMUNICATIONS,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY OF MADRID, SPAIN [H2019/HUM-5859]; NATIONAL RD PLAN [PID 2019-107161 GB-C32]",WOS

THE RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY IS DETERMINED BOTH BY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PROBLEM OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATION IN GENERAL, AND BY THE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, WHICH AROSE DURING THE CRISIS CAUSED BY COVID-19. THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THE EMERGENCY TRANSITION OF RUSSIAN EDUCATION TO THE DISTANCE FORMAT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ONGOING PANDEMIC, HAVE YET TO BE ASSESSED, BUT THE REACTION OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS TO THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE TOTAL DISTANCE LEARNING SHOULD BE ANALYSED IMMEDIATELY AS A BASIS FOR FUTURE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. AIM. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT RESEARCH IS A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PERCEPTION OF THE EXPERIENCE OF AN EMERGENCY TRANSITION TO A DISTANT EDUCATION FORMAT BY THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. METHODOLOGY AND RESEARCH METHODS. ONLINE SURVEY BASED ON GOOGLE FORMS WAS EMPLOYED AS THE MAIN METHOD. THE RESPONDENTS TO THE SURVEY INCLUDED PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS, MOSTLY PERMANENTLY RESIDING IN THE SVERDLOVSK REGION (99% OF THE RESPONDENTS). THE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN SEPTEMBER - OCTOBER 2020. THE SURVEY PARTICIPATION WAS VOLUNTARY AND COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS. AS A RESULT OF THE SURVEY CONDUCTED, MORE THAN 24,500 ORIGINAL RESPONSES WERE RECEIVED AND PROCESSED. THE DATA OBTAINED WERE COMPARED WITH THE RESULTS OF SECONDARY STUDIES (PRIMARILY, WITH THE MONITORING STUDIES OF THE HIGHER SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS). RESULTS. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT SHORTCOMINGS IN THE STRATEGY OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF EDUCATION, SUCH AS THE INSUFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIGITAL COMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE REGIONS, THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND COMPETENCE-BASED DIGITAL INEQUALITY, THE LACK OF WELL-DEVELOPED METHODS OF USING DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL TOOLS, THE LACK OF HIGH-QUALITY CONTENT, THE LACK OF FULL-FLEDGED INTEGRATED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES ON THE MARKET. THE SHORTCOMINGS MENTIONED ABOVE APPARENTLY LED TO A DECREASE IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION DURING THE PERIOD OF SELF-ISOLATION AND PROVOKED A REACTION OF REJECTION OF DIGITAL EDUCATIONAL FORMS AND AN INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGICAL PESSIMISM AMONG A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE RESULTS ARE PRESENTED IN CORRELATION WITH SECONDARY STUDIES, WHICH CONFIRMS THE RELIABILITY OF THE GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY.

EDUC.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; SMALL TOWNS; SOCIAL INTEGRATION; EMPLOYMENT; SKILLS,DIVIDE,"INTRODUCTION. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY ABOUT THE SOCIAL INCLUSION OF WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF BASIC DIGITAL COMPETENCE. ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO KNOW THE LEVEL OF SKILL ACQUIRED IN THE DIFFERENT COMPETENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BASIC LEVEL ACCORDING TO SAID MODEL, TO ANALYZE WHAT EXTENT THESE LEARNINGS HAVE IMPROVED THEIR LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE, ALSO CONSIDERING WHETHER THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AT THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC LEVEL ACCORDING TO AGE, LEVEL VARIABLES ACADEMIC, FAMILY AND WORK SITUATION. METHOD. TO THIS END, A QUESTIONNAIRE ON BASIC DIGITAL COMPETENCE AND SOCIAL AND LABOR INCLUSION HAS BEEN APPLIED TO 240 WOMEN FROM RURAL SETTINGS PARTICIPATING IN DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMS FOR EMPLOYMENT, AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 65 YEARS. RESULTS. THE RESULTS SHOW A LEVEL OF ACQUIRED DIGITAL COMPETENCE THAT ALLOWS THE INTERMEDIATE USE OF SOME TEXT PROCESSING TOOLS AND THE USE OF INTERNET PORTALS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS SUCH AS FACEBOOK, FINDING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN WOMEN BASED ON THEIR AGE AND FAMILY SITUATION AND WORK. IN THE CASE OF MORE ADVANCED RESOURCES RELATED TO SOCIAL AND LABOUR INCLUSION SUCH AS LINKEDIN APPLICATIONS AND CLOUD TOOLS, THERE IS GREATER IGNORANCE AND GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ITS MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION. IN THIS SENSE, THERE ARE SIMILARITIES WITH OTHER RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS, REGARDING THE EXISTING GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DIFFICULTIES IN INSERTING THESE PEOPLE INTO THE LABOUR MARKET. DISCUSSION. THE DISCUSSION OF RESULTS PRESENTS SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FORMATION OF A DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP ACCORDING TO THE DIGCOMP2.1 MODEL AND THE NEED FOR TRAINING PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA, SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT WOMEN IN RURAL AREAS.","UNIV MALAGA, MALAGA, SPAIN.;  UNIV ESTATAL MATO GROSSO DO SUL, DOURADOS, MS, BRAZIL.","AGUILERA, FJG (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MALAGA, MALAGA, SPAIN.","ALVAREZ SIGUENZA J F, 2019, DOI 10.24137/raeic.6.11.12; BOURDIEU P, 1964; CABELLO R, 2014; CABERO J, 2017; CACERES M D, 2015; GOMEZ D, 2019, DOI 10.22325/fes/res.2018.16; SEBASTIAN M, 2011; CASTANO C, 2011; CASTELLS M, 2012; DEL PINO J, 2017; EUR C, 2017; AGUILERA F, 2019; GARCIA F, 2019; GIL-JUAREZ A, 2011; GOMEZ-HERNANDEZ J, 2017, DOI 10.3145/epi.2017.ene.03; JIMENEZ R, 2014, DOI 10.14198/geogra2014.5.67; JIMENEZ-CORTES R, 2015, DOI 10.7203/relieve.21.1.5153; JUNTA DE A, 2018; JUNTA DE E, 2020; LLANO J, 2018; NAVARRO BELTRA M, 2009, DOI 10.14198/fem.2009.14.11; OLARTE S, 2017; PINO JUSTE M, 2015; REBOLLO M A, 2012; REBOLLO-CATALAN A, 2017, DOI 10.6018/rie.35.2.270881; REDES, 2019; SUBIRATS J, 2002, DOI 10.3989/ris.2002.i33.728; TARRAGA B, 2020; TORRENT J, 2014; UNESCO, 2017; UNESCO, 2015; VARELA J, 2015; BOSCH A, 2018",0,2021,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000606925200002,ISI,UNIV MALAGA;UNIV ESTATAL MATO GROSSO DO SUL,UNIV MALAGA,NA,"AGUILERA FJG, 2021, REV COMPLUT EDUC","AGUILERA FJG, 2021, REV COMPLUT EDUC",BRAZIL;SPAIN,10.5209/rced.67590,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,"UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",NA,WOS

Q.,ARTICLE,BUREAUCRACY; CIVIL REGISTRY; ADMINISTRATIVE EXCLUSION; ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS; E-GOVERNMENT; DIGITALIZATION; PUBLIC VALUE; DIGITAL DIVIDE; PROCESS MINING; RED TAPE; DIGITAL WELFARE; DIGITAL GOVERNMENT,ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN; DIGITAL GOVERNMENT; HIDDEN; STATE,"THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF AUTOMATION IN GOVERNMENT DIGITAL SYSTEMS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ARE NOT SUITED TO COVER ALL CITIZENS EQUALLY AND MAY CAUSE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON EXCLUDED CITIZENS. THE CASE PRESENTED IN THIS STUDY IS THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR AWARDING CHILD BENEFITS IN NORWAY. BASED ON DATA FROM THE NATIONAL REGISTRY, MOST RECIPIENTS ARE AWARDED THE BENEFIT AUTOMATICALLY. HOWEVER, SOME CITIZENS ARE NOT COVERED BY THE AUTOMATION AND MUST APPLY MANUALLY. THE THEORETICAL FRAMING OF THE STUDY COMBINES MODERN AND CLASSIC VIEWS OF HOW CITIZENS ACCESS PUBLIC SERVICES BY COMBINING THEORY FROM RECENT LITERATURE ON ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND THE OLDER THEORY OF ACCESS. THE DATA ANALYSIS IS DONE WITH PROCESS MINING, AN INNOVATIVE METHOD OF SORTING AND UNDERSTANDING DATA. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT PREVIOUS FINDINGS OF HOW REGISTRY DATA AND AUTOMATED COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN GOVERNMENT CAN CREATE INEQUALITY IN SERVICE QUALITY. FURTHERMORE, THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT LOW-INCOME CITIZENS ARE DISPROPORTIONALLY REQUIRED TO APPLY MANUALLY. THE STUDY ADDRESSES QUESTIONS CONCERNING WHY AUTOMATED SYSTEMS FAIL TO COVER ALL CITIZENS AND THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES GENERATED BY THIS EXCLUSION WHEN GOVERNMENTS RELY ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN DELIVERING WELFARE PROGRAMMES. THESE ARE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS, AS GOVERNMENT DIGITALISATION IS INCREASINGLY INNOVATING WITH AUTOMATED SYSTEMS TO DELIVER PUBLIC SERVICES.","OSLOMET OSLO METROPOLITAN UNIV, POSTBOKS 4,ST OLAVS PLASS, N-0130 OSLO, NORWAY.","LARSSON, KK (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), OSLOMET OSLO METROPOLITAN UNIV, POSTBOKS 4,ST OLAVS PLASS, N-0130 OSLO, NORWAY.","ANDRESEN H, 2008; ATKINSON A, 2017; BENDOR L, 2019; BLEIKLIE I, 1997; BOVENS M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00168; BOWKER G C, 2000; BOZEMAN B, 2014; BOZEMAN B, 1993; BRODKIN E, 2010, DOI 10.1093/jopart/mup046; CHRISTENSEN J, 2020, DOI 10.1111/puar.13134; CHUDNOVSKY M, 2021, DOI 10.1111/spol.12639; DUNLEAVY P, 2006, DOI 10.1093/jopart/mui057; DUNLEAVY P, 2016; EPLAND J, 2016; FOUCAULT M, 1984; GOODSELL C, 1981; GRODEM A S, 2017; HEINRICH C, 2016, DOI 10.1093/jopart/muv034; HERD P, 2019; JAAKKOLA D, 2018; JANOWSKI T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2015.07.001; JANSSENSWILLEN G, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2018.10.018; KATSONIS M, 2015, DOI 10.1111/1467-8500.12144; KEDDELL E, 2019, DOI 10.3390/socsci8100281; LINDGREN I, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2019.03.002; LIPS M, 2019; LIPSKY M, 2010; MADSEN C, 2016; MANDAL R, 2016; MARSHALL T H, 2014; MINISTRY OF CHILDREN AND F, 2017; MOYNIHAN D, 2015, DOI 10.1093/jopart/muu009; MOYNIHAN D, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0275074010366732; PEETERS R, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0095399719854367; PEETERS R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.02.003; REDDICK C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.003; SCHAFFER B, 1975, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-7660.1975.tb00674.x; SCHOLTA H, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.11.010; SKEVIK A, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0047279403007013; STANDING G, 2011; TITMUSS, 1958; VAN DER AALST W, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-19345-3; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; WEBER M, 2019; WIHLBORG E, 2016",12,2021,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000605150800011,ISI,OSLOMET OSLO METROPOLITAN UNIV,OSLOMET OSLO METROPOLITAN UNIV,NA,"LARSSON KK, 2021, GOV INF Q","LARSSON KK, 2021, GOV INF Q",NORWAY,10.1016/j.giq.2020.101547,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,12,ELSEVIER INC,NORWEGIAN LABOUR AND WELFARE ADMINISTRATION (NAV); RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY [289920],WOS

FOR MOST UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR ACADEMIC LIBRARIES, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A LESS STRONG ONLINE PRESENCE, THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES. HOWEVER, IT HAS ALSO BEEN A CATALYST FOR CHANGE AND RESIFTING OF PRIORITIES.

FINDINGS THE COMPLETE AND INVOLUNTARY SHIFT TO ONLINE LEARNING DUE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO MULTIPLE CHALLENGES IN HIGHER EDUCATION, WHICH ARE COMPLEX AND ONGOING: THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REMOTE TOOLS AND PRACTICES EN MASSE IN ONLINE TEACHING AND LEARNING IN A WAY THAT ENSURES ACCESSIBILITY AND EQUITY FOR ALL, ISSUES CONNECTING TO ONLINE PEDAGOGY AND HOW TO PREPARE STUDENTS WITH THE INFORMATION AND DIGITAL LITERACY COMPETENCES REQUIRED FOR THE NEW ONLINE LEARNING ""NORMAL"". AS ACADEMIC LIBRARIES MOVE FORWARD, THEY HAVE A RENEWED MISSION TO HELP LEARNERS IN THE ONLINE SPACE TO BECOME BOTH INFORMATION RICH AND DIGITALLY COMPETENT.

ISTRAZ.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; E-GOVERNMENT; EUROPEAN UNION; INTERNET ACCESS,NA,"EVEN THOUGH THE INTERNET USAGE IS PERCEIVED TO BE WIDESPREAD, SENIOR CITIZENS ARE RELATIVELY MORE RELUCTANT TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES. BY RELYING ON THE EUROSTAT'S COMMUNITY STATISTICS ON INFORMATION SOCIETY (CSIS) MICRODATA FOR THE PERIOD 2008-2017, WE EXPLORE RECENT EVOLUTION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ACROSS EUROPE. WE ANALYSE THE DIFFERENCE IN ADOPTION OF E-GOVERNANCE BY YOUNGER AND OLDER INTERNET USERS AS WELL AS THEIR REASONS FOR NOT USING E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES (SPECIFICALLY BY SUBMITTING COMPLETED FORMS TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES). ADDITIONALLY, WE SEEK TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RELUCTANCE TO ADOPT E-GOVERNANCE SERVICES BY SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE YOUNG. BY ADOPTING HECKMAN SELECTION METHODOLOGY, WE ESTABLISH THREE CATEGORIES OF FACTORS: THOSE THAT HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS FOR YOUNG AND OLD (GENDER, HOUSEHOLD SIZE, AND POPULATION DENSITY), THOSE HAVING SIMILAR EFFECTS (ECONOMIC ACTIVITY), AND THOSE THAT HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS FOR THE YOUNG AND THE OLD (EDUCATION). BASED ON EMPIRICAL RESULTS, WE SUGGEST FOLLOWING VENUES FOR EU-WIDE POLICY ACTIONS: SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO OLDER POPULATION IN SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS, SPECIALISED LEARNING ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED FOR OLDER CITIZENS WITH ADDITIONAL EFFORT TO PROMOTE INCLUSION OF OLDER WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE LEARNING ACTIVITIES.","INST ECON, DEPT LABOUR MARKET & SOCIAL POLICY, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  INST ECON, DEPT INNOVAT BUSINESS ECON & BUSINESS SECT, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","BOTRIC, V (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), INST ECON, DEPT LABOUR MARKET & SOCIAL POLICY, ZAGREB, CROATIA.","AJZEN I, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t; ALZAHRANI L, 2018, DOI 10.1080/10580530.2018.1440730; CACERES R, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1371785; BELANGER F, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.002; BERKOWSKY R, 2017, DOI 10.1093/geroni/igy002; BIMBER B, 1999; CARTER L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x; CHAN F, 2010; COLESCA S, 2008; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DEWAN S, 2005; DWIVEDI Y, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.03.001; EDMISTON K, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0275074002250255; EUROPEAN C, 2020; EUROPEAN C, 2005; FRIEMEL T N, 2010; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GHAREEB ABEER M, 2019; GILLEARD C, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10433-008-0083-7; GOEL R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2011.08.003; GOLDFINCH S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8500.2009.00643.x; HAIGH N, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.016127; HARGITTAI E, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0617-5; HECKMAN J, 1979, DOI 10.2307/1912352; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0093650209356439; HUNADY J, 2019, DOI 10.3233/ip-180086; HUNSAKER A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818787348; JANSSEN, 2009; KERANEN N, 2017, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5507; KIM Y, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03601270802000576; KONIG R, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0609-5; KORUPP S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/esr/jci030; LEE B, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.01.003; LEE J, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.11.007; LOGES W, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004007; MARTINEZ-DOMINGUEZ M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2019.101226; MCLEOD A, 2009; MCNEAL R, 2008, DOI 10.1080/19331680802298298; MENSAH I, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2158244020933593; MENSAH I, 2020, DOI 10.1080/01900692.2019.1628059; MENSAH I, 2019, DOI 10.1080/01900692.2017.1405980; NDOU V, 2004, DOI https://; NIEHAVES B, 2010; PEACOCK S, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10433-007-0067-z; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; RAD M, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10209-017-0534-z; RANA N, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10796-015-9613-y; SANTA R, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.10.007; SCHEHL B, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.031; SEIFERT A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2017.1326224; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; SIPIOR J, 2005; TAIPALE S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.05.005; TEJEDO-ROMERO F, 2020, DOI 10.1080/19331681.2020.1713958; THOMPSON D, 2005, DOI 10.1108/09564230510614022; TWIZEYIMANA J, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2019.01.001; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; VENKATESH V, 2016; VENKATESH V, 2014, DOI 10.1111/isj.12008; VENKATESH V, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2011.00373.x; VERKIJIKA S, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2018.05.012; VONHALDENWANG C, 2004, DOI 10.1080/0957881042000220886; WELCH E, 2005, DOI 10.1093/jopart/mui02l; WEST D, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x; WIRTZ B W, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s11115-016-0356-0; YERA A, 2020, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0231585",7,2021,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000604652400001,ISI,INST ECON;INST ECON,INST ECON,NA,"BOTRIC V, 2021, EKON ISTRAZ","BOTRIC V, 2021, EKON ISTRAZ",CROATIA;CROATIA,10.1080/1331677x.2020.1863828,NA,ECONOMICS,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NA,WOS

POLICY REV.,ARTICLE,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES; INTERNET; RURAL AREAS; SECOND DIGITAL DIVIDE,QUALITY,"MOTIVATION AS PART OF THE SECOND DIGITAL DIVIDE"", THE SCARCITY OF DIGITAL SKILLS AMONG THE ""BOTTOM BILLION"" IN POOR COUNTRIES HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE LITERATURE. THE TYPICAL POLICY RESPONSE TO THIS DAUNTING SITUATION IS TO DIRECTLY INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF THESE MISSING RESOURCES. THE ARTICLE DOES NOT DISPUTE THE NEED FOR SUCH POLICY, BUT ARGUES IN FAVOUR OF SUPPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS THATBYPASSTHIS SCARCITY IN A BID TO BRING THE BENEFIT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY. PURPOSE TO DESCRIBE AND COMPARE THE COMPONENTS OF APACKAGEOF POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE SCARCITY OF DIGITAL SKILLS IN POOR COUNTRIES. THE PACKAGE COMPRISES AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF THESE SKILLS, A CHOICE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE FEW DEMANDS ON THEM, AND TO FIND SUBSTITUTES THAT CAN INDIRECTLY SUPPLY INFORMATION FROM THE INTERNET TO THOSE WHO NEED IT. APPROACH AND METHODS THE APPROACH IS BASED ON ALBERT HIRSHMAN'S DISTINCTION BETWEENTRAIT-MAKING, WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF RESOURCES IN SHORT SUPPLY, ANDTRAIT-TAKING, WHICH ACCEPTS THOSE RESOURCES AS BEING GIVEN TEMPORARILY IN THE MAKING OF POLICY. THE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES ARE EXPLAINED AND COMPARED IN DETAIL WITH THE USE OF NUMEROUS EXAMPLES. FINDINGS THE BRIEF ANSWER OF HOW BEST TO RESPOND TO THE LACK OF DIGITAL SKILLS IN POOR COUNTRIES IS THATALLCOMPONENTS OF THE POLICY PACKAGE ARE NEEDED, BECAUSE THEY MAKE DIFFERENT DEMANDS, DEAL WITH DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM, USE DIFFERENT METHODS AND OPERATE IN DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS. WITH RESPECT TO THE TRAIT-TAKING ALTERNATIVES, I SHOW THE NEED TO MAKE BETTER USE OF LOCAL RESOURCES, INSTITUTIONS AND CULTURES, BECAUSE THESE ARE WHAT ARE AVAILABLE. POLICY IMPLICATIONS ALTHOUGH MOST POLICIES TO DEAL WITH THE SCARCITY OF DIGITAL SKILLS IN POOR COUNTRIES SEEK DIRECTLY TO INCREASE THEIR SUPPLY IN SCHOOLS AND OTHER PLACES, THIS WILL OFTEN BE A LONG AND DIFFICULT PROCESS. FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS, SUPPLEMENTARY POLICIES ARE ALSO NEEDED TO BYPASS THE SHORTAGE AND YIELD THE BENEFITS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY, WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.","TILBURG UNIV, TILBURG SCH ECON & MANAGEMENT, DEPT ECON, TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.;  TILBURG UNIV, CTR ECON RES, TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","JAMES, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TILBURG UNIV, TILBURG SCH ECON & MANAGEMENT, DEPT ECON, TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.; JAMES, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), TILBURG UNIV, CTR ECON RES, TILBURG, NETHERLANDS.","AKER J, 2010, DOI 10.1257/jep.24.3.207; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BAYES A, 1999; BHATNAGAR S, 2001; BHATNAGAR S, 2003; CASTELLS M, 2009; COHEN N, 2001; CRANDALL A, 2012; DAHAN M, 2015; DELOITTE, 2014; ELDER L, 2013; FEHRLER S, 2009, DOI 10.1080/00220380802663625; GATZWEILER F, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-25718-1; GIRARD B, 2003; GORDON J, 2012; GSMA, 2017; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HIRSCHMAN A, 1958; HUGHES S, 2003; JAMES J, 2003; JAMES J, 2019; JAMES J, 1999; JAMES J, 1998; JAMES J, 2016; JAMES J, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s11205-008-9335-3; KEATING J, 2009; KRAEMER K, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1516046.1516063; LOPES M, 2003; LUNDEN I, 2018; MICHAELOWA K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0305-750x(01)00061-4; MYRDAL G, 1968; OECD, 2010; PEW RESEARCH C, 2018; SEN A, 1999; SMITH B, 2014; STEWART F, 1977; UNESCO, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014; WARSCHAUER M, 2003; WARSCHAUER M, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0021886304273248; WAVERMAN L, 2005; WORLD B, 2016; WORLD B, 2018; ZHAO S, 2007",8,2021,DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,WOS:000559826100001,ISI,TILBURG UNIV;TILBURG UNIV,TILBURG UNIV;TILBURG UNIV,NA,"JAMES J, 2021, DEV POLICY REV","JAMES J, 2021, DEV POLICY REV",NETHERLANDS;NETHERLANDS,10.1111/dpr.12479,NA,DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,8,WILEY,NA,WOS

MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE ASSOCIATION OF EACH NIC DIMENSION WITH DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN THE EU. FINDINGS DESPITE A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ALL DIMENSIONS OF NIC AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION READINESS, THE PROPOSED MODEL OF NIC WAS NOT CONFIRMED IN FULL. REGRESSION ANALYSIS PROVED SOCIAL CAPITAL AND WORKING SKILLS, A DIMENSION OF HUMAN CAPITAL, TO BE THE PREDICTORS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, ABLE TO DETECT CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES. STRUCTURAL CAPITAL, KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION, AS DIMENSIONS OF HUMAN CAPITAL, WERE PREDICTORS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TERMS OF THE INTEGRATION OF DIGITAL MEDIA IN COMPANIES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS RESEARCH HAS A LIMITED PROPENSITY FOR GENERALISATION DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMON MEASUREMENT MODELS IN THE FIELD OF NIC EXPLORATION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THIS RESEARCH OFFERS POLICY MAKERS AN INDICATION OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NIC AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, POINTING OUT WHICH DIMENSIONS OF NIC SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED TO ALLOW THE EU TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF DIGITAL ECONOMY AND TO OVERCOME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN EU MEMBER STATES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IS KEY IN CREATING ACTIVE AND INFORMED CITIZENS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE AND PRODUCTIVE COMPANIES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS SPHERE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN ORIGINAL THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND CONCEPTUAL MODEL THROUGH WHICH TO ANALYSE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NIC AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, WHICH HAS THUS FAR NOT BEEN EXPLORED AT THE LEVEL OF THE EU. THIS RESEARCH MAKES AN ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE EMPIRICAL EXPLORATION OF NIC AND PRODUCES NEW INSIGHTS IN THE FIELDS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL.","INST SOCIAL SCI IVO PILAR, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  UNIV ZAGREB, FAC HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCI, DEPT SOCIOL, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ECON & BUSINESS, DEPT INT ECON, ZAGREB, CROATIA.;  NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, COLL BUSINESS LAW & SOCIAL SCI, DEPT MANAGEMENT, NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND.","DABIC, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV ZAGREB, FAC ECON & BUSINESS, DEPT INT ECON, ZAGREB, CROATIA.; DABIC, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV, COLL BUSINESS LAW & SOCIAL SCI, DEPT MANAGEMENT, NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND.","NAVARRO J, 2011; ANDRIESSEN D, 2004; ARDITO L, 2019, DOI 10.1108/md-07-2018-0754; BETANCOURT M, 2015; BONTIS N, 2004, DOI 10.1108/14691930410512905; BORIN E, 2015, DOI 10.1108/jic-12-2014-0131; BOUNFOUR A, 2003, DOI 10.1108/14691930310487833; BOUNFOUR A, 2005; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.027; D'IPPOLITO B, 2019, DOI 10.1108/jic-04-2019-0065; DE PABLOS P, 2020, DOI 10.4324/9780429285882; DEGRYSE C, 2017; DEL GIUDICE M, 2011; DUMAY J, 2013, DOI 10.1108/14691931311288995; EDVINSSON, 2011; EDVINSSON L, 1997; EUROPEAN C, 2015; EUROPEAN C, 2017; EUROPEAN C, 2018; EVANGELISTA R, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10438599.2014.918438; HASKEL J, 2018; HASKEL J, 2018; HIRSCH-KREINSEN H, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s12651-016-0200-6; KAPYLA J, 2012, DOI 10.1108/14691931211248909; KOTARBA M, 2017, DOI 10.1515/fman-2017-0010; LABRA R, 2013, DOI 10.1108/jic-11-2012-0100; LIN CAROL Y, 2010; LIN C, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jic-12-2016-0146; LIN C, 2008, DOI 10.1108/14691930810913140; LOPEZ-RUIZ V, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.02.007; MACERINSKIENE I, 2017, DOI 10.24136/eq.v12i4.30; MACERINSKIENE I, 2016, DOI 10.14254/1800-5845/2016.12-4.6; MALHOTRA Y, 2000, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2000070101; MALHOTRA Y, 2003; MAYER J, 2018; MERTINS K, 2009; MICHALCZUK G, 2017, DOI 10.15290/ose.2017.05.89.08; MICHALCZUK G, 2019; MONDEKAR D, 2017; NAHAPIET J, 1998, DOI 10.2307/259373; NAMBISAN S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jbvi.2016.05.001; NAMBISAN S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2019.03.018; PENA D, 2017, DOI 10.5559/di.26.4.04; OECD, 2017, DOI 10.1787/9789264271036-en; PASHER E, 2005; PEDRO E, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jic-11-2016-0118; PETTY R, 2000, DOI 10.1108/14691930010348731; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-3-662-46602-5; PULIC A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/b978-0-7506-7773-8.50015-7; PUTNAM ROBERT D, 1994, DOI 10.2307/206637; NHA Q, 2012; ROOS G, 2015, DOI 10.1108/jic-02-2015-0016; SALONIUS H, 2012, DOI 10.1108/14691931211248891; SCHIUMA G, 2008, DOI 10.1108/13673270810902984; SCHWEER D, 2017; SCUOTTO V, 2017, DOI 10.1111/caim.12221; SECUNDO G, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2020.119917; SECUNDO G, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jic-11-2016-0113; SELEIM A, 2013, DOI 10.1002/kpm.1412; SERENKO A, 2013, DOI 10.1108/jic-11-2012-0099; SMIT J, 2016; SOLIMA L, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s13132-015-0243-x; SRNICEK N, 2016; STAHLE P, 2015, DOI 10.1108/jic-02-2014-0017; STAHLE P, 2008, DOI 10.1108/14691930810870283; STAM C, 2008; STEWART T, 1997; STEWART T, 1991; SVEIBY K E, 1997; UNITED N, 2019; VAN DIJCK J, 2018; VENTURELLI S, 2014, DOI 10.3389/fonc.2014.00227; WARNER K, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.lrp.2018.12.001; WDCR, 2019; WEF (WORLD ECONOMIC F, 2018; WORLD B, 2019, DOI ng bus 2019; WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (, 2019; YOO Y, 2012, DOI 10.1287/orsc.1120.0771",16,2021,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000556952100001,ISI,INST SOCIAL SCI IVO PILAR;UNIV ZAGREB;UNIV ZAGREB;NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV,UNIV ZAGREB;NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIV,NA,"SVARC J, 2021, J INTELLECT CAP","SVARC J, 2021, J INTELLECT CAP",CROATIA;CROATIA;CROATIA;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/jic-02-2020-0024,NA,BUSINESS; MANAGEMENT,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,HORIZON 2020 PROGRAMME OF THE EUROPEAN UNION [823971],WOS

BASED ON 30 IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE IN MADRID, WE ANALYZED THE MECHANISMS USED TO CONVERT THREE MAIN FORMS OF CAPITAL-ECONOMIC, CULTURAL, AND SOCIAL-INTO DIGITAL CAPITAL (DC) AND THE SUBSEQUENT RECONVERSION OF DC BACK INTO THE THREE MAIN FORMS OF CAPITAL. WE CONCLUDE THAT ECONOMIC CAPITAL IS THE MOST BASIC FORM OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY, IMPOSING MATERIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS. CULTURAL CAPITAL IS TRANSFORMED INTO DC THROUGH PEOPLE'S TECHNO-SOCIALIZATION, WHILE SOCIAL CAPITAL IS CONVERTED INTO DC BY MEANS OF SOCIAL PRACTICES AND SOCIAL SUPPORT. DC CAN BE RETRANSFORMED INTO EACH OF THE THREE MAIN FORMS OF CAPITAL: TO ECONOMIC CAPITAL BY MEANS OF PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING AND ACCESS TO GOODS; TO CULTURAL CAPITAL THROUGH ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE; AND INTO SOCIAL CAPITAL BY THE DIFFERENTIAL MANAGEMENT OF SOCIAL TIES.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.","GOMEZ, DC (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, DEPT SOCIAL ANTHROPOL & SOCIAL PSYCHOL, MADRID 28223, SPAIN.","AGGER B, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0961463x10380730; ALONSO L, 1998; ANTONIO A, 2014, DOI 10.3390/fi6040673; BARZILLAI M, 2018; BECK U, 1996; BENNETT S, 2011; BERGER P L, 2008; BOLIN G, 2018, DOI 10.4324/9781315398624-3; BOURDIEU P, 1979; BOURDIEU P, 2014; CASTANO C, 2009; CASTANO C, 2011, DOI 10.5477/cis/reis.136.127; CASTANO C, 2008; CASTELLS M, 2010; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; COURTOIS C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814562162; DALVIT L, 2018; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1086/ahr/69.3.805; DUTTON W, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1353640; DUTTON W, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010001; EYNON R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2014.1002845; GHOBADI S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2013.833650; GIDDENS A, 1995; GOMEZ D, 2018, DOI 10.31211/interacoes.n34.2018.a4; GONZALES A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1050438; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HELSPER E, 2015; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HUANG K, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010005; KIRSCHNER P, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tate.2017.06.001; LAHIRE B, 2013; LASEN A, 2014; LEVY P, 2007; LUPA P, 2018; MARIEN I, 2014, DOI 10.1108/info-07-2014-0030; MINGO I, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11205-016-1511-2; NORRIS P, 2000; PALFREY J, 2011; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424843; RAGNEDDA M, 2017; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819869604; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; RICHARDSON J G, 1986; RIFKIN J, 2011; RITZER G, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0002764211429368; ROBINSON L, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.770049; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; SAEZ VACAS F, 2011; SAUNDERS B, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11135-017-0574-8; SEFTON-GREEN J, 2009, DOI 10.1080/15544800902741556; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SELWYN N, 2009, DOI 10.1108/00012530910973776; SILVERSTONE R, 1993, DOI 10.1108/eb051328; SMITH M A, 1999; STRAUBHAAR J, 2012; TAIPALE S, 2018; VALLES M, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DIJK J, 2014; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VILLANUEVA-MANSILLA E, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010004",24,2021,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000540510500001,ISI,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,NA,"GOMEZ DC, 2021, NEW MEDIA SOC","GOMEZ DC, 2021, NEW MEDIA SOC",SPAIN,10.1177/1461444820933252,NA,COMMUNICATION,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID [FEI-EU-17-24],WOS

THE ANALYSIS COMPRISED FOUR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CONTEXTS: AGE, EDUCATION, GENDER, AND INCOME. BECAUSE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE'S COMPLEXITY, A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH WAS APPLIED - FACTOR ANALYSIS WITH OBLIQUE ROTATION, WHICH RESULTED IN TWO DISTINCT DIMENSIONS: E-SERVICES AND SOCIAL NETWORKS. TO TEST THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF EUROPEAN UNION POSITIONING AND EUROPEAN UNION DISPARITIES, MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND SQUARED RANK TEST WERE COMPUTED. FINDINGS SHOW THAT E-SERVICES ADOPTION IS INFLUENCED PRIMARILY BY THE EDUCATION LEVEL OF INDIVIDUALS, WHILE SOCIAL NETWORKS ADOPTION IS MORE AFFECTED BY INDIVIDUALS' AGE.","UNIV NOVA LISBOA, NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH, NOVA IMS, CAMPUS CAMPOLIDE, P-1070312 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;  BANCO PORTUGAL, LISBON, PORTUGAL.","CRUZ-JESUS, F (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV NOVA LISBOA, NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH, NOVA IMS, CAMPUS CAMPOLIDE, P-1070312 LISBON, PORTUGAL.","ANTONIO A, 2014, DOI 10.3390/fi6040673; ARAQUE J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.032; BALLANO S, 2014, DOI 10.15581/003.27.4.147-155; BERRY R, 2011; BOSTROM N, 2007; BRESNAHAN T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/s0169-7218(10)02002-2; BROTCORNE P, 2010; CAMPBELL D, 2001, DOI 10.1111/j.1564-913x.2001.tb00217.x; CASTANO C, 2008; CILAN C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.11.002; CILAN Q A, 2013; COELHO J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.053; CONOVER W, 1999; COOPER J, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00185.x; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10796-016-9634-1; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.027; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; DIXON L, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12088; ERNEST-JONES T, 2008; EUROPEAN C, 2010; FAKHOURY R, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2017.03.004; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HAN S, 2016, DOI 10.25300/misq/2016/40.4.09; HILBERT M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012; HILBERT M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.019; IACOBUCCI D, 2001, DOI 10.1207/s15327663jcp1001&2_01; IGARASHI Y, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.red.2016.01.002; INTERNATIONAL MONETARY F, 2014; JUN S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.014; KATHURIA V, 2018, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2018.1438549; KENNEDY T, 2003; KYRIAKIDOU V, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2011.09.001; LAST C, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2016.06.013; LEE C, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.002; LEUNG L, 2009, DOI 10.1177/1461444809341264; LIN C, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.054; LINDBLOM T, 2017, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2017.1294124; LIU C, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2016.07.018; LUDERS M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2016.1271070; MIGUEL F, 2011; MITZNER T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.020; MUMPOREZE N, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.05.014; MUNOZ D, 2010, DOI 10.29292/jics.v5i1.309; NISHIJIMA M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.10.004; OECD, 2015, DOI 10.1787/9789264239555-en; OECD, 2001, DOI 10.1093/ilj/6.1.52; PARK E, 2014, DOI 10.1111/ijcs.12107; PARK S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.02.011; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; PIVEC F, 2003, DOI 10.3359/oz0304203; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; QUAN-HAASE A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1140217; RICHMOND K, 2018, DOI 10.1080/02692171.2017.1338677; RIGGINS, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00074; RITZHAUPT A, 2013, DOI 10.1080/15391523.2013.10782607; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1014205; ROGERS E, 1995, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-79868-9_2; RUMMEL R J, 1970; SADOWSKI B, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2016.09.009; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008; SELWYN N, 2010, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v7i1.660; SHARMA S, 1996; TAIPALE S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.05.005; TANG T, 2014, DOI 10.1509/jm.13.0301; UNITED N, 2016; UNITED N, 2014, DOI 10.1016/s1369-7021(02)00629-6; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57; VAN DIJK J, 2009; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; CUERVO M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2006.05.001; VICENTE M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2006.03.039; VROMAN K, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.018; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227877; WEBSTER F, 2013; WONG Y, 2015, DOI 10.1080/15228835.2014.998576; WORLD B, 2016; WORLD BANK G, 2012, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8991-1; YOUSAFZAI A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2016.05.010; YU L, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0165551511426246; YU R, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109695; ZHANG X, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.12.011; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",36,2021,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000533831700001,ISI,UNIV NOVA LISBOA,UNIV NOVA LISBOA,NA,"ELENA-BUCEA A, 2021, INF SYST FRONT","ELENA-BUCEA A, 2021, INF SYST FRONT",PORTUGAL;PORTUGAL,10.1007/s10796-020-10012-9,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS",36,SPRINGER,NA,WOS

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DESCRIBE USE OF AND PERCEIVED DIFFICULTIES IN USE OF THE INTERNET AMONG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND TO EXPLORE DIGITAL DIVIDES IN-BETWEEN AND WITHIN DISABILITY GROUPS, AND IN COMPARISON WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION. THIS IS A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY TARGETING THE SAME ISSUES AS OTHER NATIONWIDE SURVEYS BUT ADAPTED FOR PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE DISABILITIES. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM MAY TO OCTOBER 2017 BY ADAPTIVE SNOWBALL SAMPLING. THE SURVEY COMPRISED QUESTIONS ON ACCESS TO AND USE OF DEVICES, AND USE OF AND PERCEIVED DIFFICULTIES IN USE OF INTERNET. A TOTAL OF 771 PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY, REPRESENTING 35 DIAGNOSES/IMPAIRMENTS. LARGER PROPORTIONS OF PEOPLE WITH AUTISM, ADHD AND BIPOLAR DISORDER REPORTED USING INTERNET THAN OTHER DISABILITY GROUPS. WOMEN WITH AUTISM USED THE INTERNET MORE THAN ANY OTHER DISABILITY GROUP, AND WOMEN WITH APHASIA USED THE INTERNET THE LEAST. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES RELATED TO LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTANDING REPORTED MORE DIFFICULTIES USING INTERNET THAN OTHER DISABILITY GROUPS. LARGER PROPORTIONS OF PARTICIPANTS THAN THE GENERAL SWEDISH POPULATION REPORTED NOT FEELING DIGITALLY INCLUDED.

THIS RESEARCH PAYS ATTENTION TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME DISTRIBUTION AND INTERNET ACCESS WITHIN METROPOLITAN AREAS OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH, WITH A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON LOCAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD SHAPE THE WAYS BY WHICH THIS RELATIONSHIP WORKS. USING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH, TWO LATIN AMERICAN METROPOLITAN AREAS ARE ANALYSED: SANTIAGO (CHILE) AND MEDELLIN (COLOMBIA). ALTHOUGH INCOME IS CLEARLY LINKED TO HOUSEHOLD INTERNET ACCESS IN BOTH CASES, THERE ARE SUPPLY-SIDE DIFFERENCES THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE INCOME-CONNECTIVITY NEXUS. THE AUTHOR PROPOSES TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF 'INSTITUTIONALLY GENERATED NETWORK DISADVANTAGE'. EXAMPLES OF FORMAL AND INFORMAL INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS ARE REDLINING, INFORMAL HOUSING, SOCIO-SPATIAL SEGREGATION, TAX EXEMPTIONS AND LOCAL PUBLIC PROVISION OF SERVICES.

THE ARTICLE ADVANCES OUR THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INEQUALITIES IN ONLINE AND OFFLINE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION EMERGE THROUGH COGNITIVE PATHWAYS, BY APPLYING SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY TO CONCEPTUALIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES, COGNITION AND BEHAVIOR. USING SURVEY DATA FROM 1,488 INTERNET USERS IN GERMANY, WE INVESTIGATE HOW THE COGNITIVE DISPOSITIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA SELF-EFFICACY AND ONLINE PRIVACY CONCERNS MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS ON INTERNET USE, AND ONLINE AS WELL AS OFFLINE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOUNGER CITIZENS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN ONLINE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION, WHILE OLDER, MORE EDUCATED, AND MALE CITIZENS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN OFFLINE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION.

GENDER IS AMONG THE CHARACTERISTICS AFFECTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S DEGREE OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT ON THE INTERNET-EVEN WHEN CONTROLLING FOR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. TO EXPLAIN THIS GENDER DIVIDE, IT IS NECESSARY TO GO BEYOND PURELY RESOURCE-BASED PERSPECTIVES. SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY ALLOWS FOR AN ANALYSIS OF HOW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SHAPE COGNITIONS, SUCH AS POLITICAL EFFICACY, WHICH, IN TURN, FOSTER POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. POLITICAL EFFICACY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE LOWER AMONG WOMEN COMPARED TO MEN. THIS STUDY EXPLORES DETERMINANTS OF GENDERED ONLINE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION (OPP) BY ANALYZING HOW SELF-EFFICACY MEDIATES THE EFFECT OF NEWLY DEVELOPED MEASURES OF THREE DIFFERENT WAVES OF FEMINIST ATTITUDES ON OPP. BASED ON A SURVEY OF 1,078 INTERNET USERS IN GERMANY, 70% OF THEM WOMEN, WE ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF FEMINISM ON POLITICAL EFFICACY AND PARTICIPATION. FEMINISM IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER INTERNAL POLITICAL EFFICACY. ALSO, SOME FEMINIST PARADIGMS ARE SHOWN TO EMPOWER WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE POLITICALLY ONLINE. THIS EFFECT, HOWEVER, IS NOT MEDIATED THROUGH EFFICACY.

NEW CHALLENGES FOR USERS ARISE FROM INCREASED AMOUNT OF DATA, DECISIONS MADE AUTOMATICALLY, LESS VISIBILITY AND MORE AMBIGUITY, AND MAGNIFIED SECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS. THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE THAT ONLY A SELECTIVE GROUP WILL BENEFIT,MAKING IT IMPORTANT TO STUDY IOT FROM A DIGITAL INEQUALITY PERSPECTIVE. THE CURRENT STUDY FOCUSED ON HEALTH, HOME, AND SECURITY RELATED IOT BY CONDUCTING A SURVEY AMONG A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE DUTCH POPULATION. THE STUDY WAS GUIDED BY RESOURCES AND APPROPRIATION THEORY. IOT ATTITUDES AND MATERIAL ACCESS AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL AND INCOME DIFFERENCES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THOSE WITH HIGHER EDUCATION AND THOSE WITH HIGHER INCOMES HAVE MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES AND ARE THE FIRST TO ACTUALLY BUY IOT. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEY ARE THE FIRST TO DEVELOP THE REQUIRED SKILLS AND TO ENGAGE IN A DIVERSE IOT USE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TO MAKE THE IOT ATTRACTIVE FOR LARGER PARTS OF THE POPULATION, CLEAR TERMS OF USE AND USER-FRIENDLY IOT SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE. STIMULATING POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS IOT WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF IOT OWNERSHIP, DEVELOPMENT OF IOT SKILLS, AND, EVENTUALLY, A WIDER DIVERSITY OF IOT USE. POLICIES SHOULD AIM TO STRESS THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES IOT HAS TO OFFER AND SHOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE OF HOW PERSONAL DATA IS USED AS WELL AS BETTER PRIVACY, SECURITY PRACTICES AND REGULATION.","UNIV TWENTE, FAC BEHAV MANAGEMENT & SOCIAL SCI, ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","VAN DEURSEN, AJAM (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TWENTE, FAC BEHAV MANAGEMENT & SOCIAL SCI, ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.","ATZORI L, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2010.05.010; BARZILAI-NAHON K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600903953; BIBRI S, 2015; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; BOURDIEU P, 1992; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; CLAYTON J, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.748817; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; DE BOER P, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.12.004; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DIMAGGIO P, 2012, DOI 10.1146/annurev.soc.012809.102545; DORNBERGER R, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-74322-6_1; DURNDELL A, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00006-7; GOLDFARB A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001; GUBBI J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2013.01.010; HAIR J, 2006; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; MARQUIE J, 2002, DOI 10.1080/0144929021000020998; MARTIN S, 2007, DOI 10.1525/sp.2007.54.1.1; MERAZ S, 2008; MOSSBERGER K, 2009; NEVES B, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2014.11.002; ONO H, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2006.09.001; PASCHOU M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.simpat.2012.08.002; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; REISDORF B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815621539; RICE R E, 2001; RIGGINS F, 2015, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2015.186; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SHAKIBA M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s11192-016-2095-y; SHERBOURNE C, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0277-9536(91)90150-b; SPARKS C, 2014; VAN DER ZEEUW A, 2019; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.171; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; WITTE J C, 2009; ZICKUHR K, 2012; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",33,2021,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000477629700001,ISI,UNIV TWENTE,UNIV TWENTE,NA,"VAN DEURSEN AJAM, 2021, INFO COMMUN SOC","VAN DEURSEN AJAM, 2021, INFO COMMUN SOC",NETHERLANDS,10.1080/1369118x.2019.1646777,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR WETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK [452-17-001],WOS

IN LINE WITH THIS, PROVIDING ACCESS TO ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE FOR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS HAS BEEN A PROMINENT POLICY TOOL. THE ADVENT OF DIGITAL FINANCE MAY PROVE A GAME CHANGER IN THAT IT COULD SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THE THRESHOLD TO ACCESS ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE, PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED ENTREPRENEUR WHO HAVE A HARD TIME ACCESSING FORMAL SOURCES OF FINANCE. THIS STUDY EXPLORES WHETHER THE AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL FINANCE INDEED INCREASES THE PROPENSITY AND THE QUALITY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG CHINESE MIGRANTS. THE PAPER APPLIES DATA OF THE CHINA MIGRANTS DYNAMIC SURVEY IN 2018 AND THE CHINA'S DIGITAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION INDEX. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT LOCAL DIGITAL FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS INDEED POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ENTREPRENEURIAL PROBABILITY AND QUALITY. MOREOVER, THE THREE SUB-DIMENSIONS OF DIGITAL FINANCE (E.G., BREADTH OF COVERAGE, DEPTH OF USE AND LEVEL OF DIGITIZATION) ALSO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF MIGRANTS' ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL MOTIVATION, DIGITAL FINANCE HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON NOT ONLY THE MIGRANTS' CHOICE OF NECESSITY-BASED ENTREPRENEURSHIP, BUT ALSO ON THE SELECTION OF OPPORTUNITY-BASED ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN ADDITION, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT THE FACILITATING ROLE OF DIGITAL FINANCE ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS MORE PROMINENT FOR MIGRANTS WHO LIVED IN RURAL REGIONS, WITH LOWER EDUCATIONAL LEVELS, EXPERIENCED CROSS-PROVINCIAL MOBILITY, NOT BELONGING TO A MEMBER OF PARTY ORGANIZATION AND WHOSE PARENTS DO NOT HAVE GOOD EDUCATION BACKGROUND AND LOCAL HUKOU, WHICH REFLECTS THE INCLUSIVENESS OF DIGITAL FINANCE IN REVERSING THE FINANCING DISADVANTAGE OF VULNERABLE GROUPS.

AND FINALLY, A CONTINUATION OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES IN THE FACE-TO-FACE FORMAT. AT THE SAME TIME, MANY SCHOOLS WERE FACED WITH A DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG FAMILIES AND A LACK OF TEACHER TRAINING IN DIGITAL SKILLS.

GIVEN WIDESPREAD POVERTY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THIS HAS RAISED CONCERNS OVER NEW FORMS OF LEARNING INEQUALITIES. USING NATIONWIDE DATA ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN SLUM AND RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN BANGLADESH, WE EXAMINE HOW LEARNING TIME AT HOME DURING THE EARLY MONTHS OF SCHOOL CLOSURE VARIES BY ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AT HOME. DATA CONFIRMS A SIGNIFICANT SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND GENDER DIVIDE IN ACCESS TO TV, SMARTPHONE, COMPUTER, AND INTERNET AMONG RURAL HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS OF DAILY TIME USE DATA SHOWS ONLY A MODEST RETURN TO A TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF BOOSTING LEARNING TIME AT HOME. THE LEARNING-GRADE GRADIENT IS SHALLOW AND INSENSITIVE TO TV, SMARTPHONE, AND COMPUTER ACCESS AT HOME. WE ALSO FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT TECHNOLOGY ACCESS PER SE HELPS LEARNING BY BOOSTING TIME SPENT IN ONLINE SCHOOLING AND PRIVATE SUPPLEMENTARY COACHING/TUTORING. WHILE TECHNOLOGY ACCESS MATTERS IN HOUSEHOLDS WHERE PARENTS ACT AS HOME TUTORS, THE MAGNITUDE OF SUCH A COMPLEMENTARY EFFECT ARE NOT LARGE. THE RESULTS IMPLY A LOSS OF OUT-OF-SCHOOL LEARNING TIME DURING SCHOOL CLOSURE EVEN IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH TECHNOLOGY ACCESS.

PANEL DATA FROM EUROSTAT FOR 2014-2020 ARE APPLIED. WE FOUND THAT MORE DIGITALLY DEVELOPED EU COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ESTONIA, THE NETHERLANDS, DENMARK AND NORWAY, SHOW A HIGHER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNET USAGE AND DIGITAL PERFORMANCE THAN OTHER EU COUNTRIES.

THE RESULTS OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EMPHASIZE THAT NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THE INTERNET NEGATIVELY IMPACTS FEELINGS OF BELONGING AND SELF-CONFIDENCE. CITIZENS NEED TO INVEST CONTINUALLY IN NEW OR DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT AND IN SKILLS TO KEEP UP. OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST ARE SHAPED AT THE NEXUS OF GENDER, CLASS, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AND OCCUPATIONAL STATUS. THEREFORE, SIMPLY TRAINING PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR DIGITAL SKILLS IS INSUFFICIENT.

THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO THE INTERESTS AND FREQUENCY OF INTERNET USES, SO THAT WOMEN ARE LESS INTERESTED IN ENTERTAINMENT WITH ICT IN GENERAL AND, SPECIFICALLY, IN ONLINE GAMES AND SPORTS. WOMEN SPENT MORE TIME SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION TO DO ACADEMIC ASSIGNMENTS, WORKING IN GROUPS AND POSTING PHOTOS AND MALES PLAYING ONLINE GAMES.

PEOPLE,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL INCLUSION; SENIORS; WELFARE REGIMES,E-GOVERNMENT; INFORMATION; INEQUALITY; EQUALITY; WORLDS,"PURPOSE TECHNOLOGY ACCESS, DIGITAL SKILLS, AND DIGITAL SERVICES ARE INCREASINGLY PREREQUISITES FOR PUBLIC LIFE AND ACCESSING PUBLIC SERVICES. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES MATTERS FOR EFFORTS TO DIGITALIZE THE WELFARE STATE. RESEARCH HAS ALREADY MAPPED INDIVIDUAL DETERMINANTS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND THE EXISTENCE OF AN AGE-RELATED DIGITAL DIVIDE. HOWEVER, FAR LESS ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO VARIATIONS IN DIGITAL INCLUSION BETWEEN COUNTRIES AND TO THEIR POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS RELATED TO POLITICAL SYSTEMS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF VARIATIONS IN WELFARE REGIMES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG SENIORS (AGED 65+) IN EUROPE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS TIME-SERIES CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WELFARE STATE REGIMES AND DIGITAL INCLUSION AMONG SENIORS IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE ANALYSES ARE BASED ON DATA FROM EUROSTAT, THE WORLD BANK, AND THE UN E-GOVERNMENT SURVEY. FINDINGS THE AUTHORS FIND EXTENSIVE VARIATION IN THE DIGITAL INCLUSION OF CITIZENS BETWEEN WELFARE REGIMES AND ARGUE THAT CONSIDERING REGIME DIFFERENCES IMPROVES THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE VARIATIONS. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE AGE-RELATED DIGITAL DIVIDE SEEMS TO BE LEAST EVIDENT IN COUNTRIES WITH MORE UNIVERSALISTIC WELFARE REGIMES AND MOST EVIDENT IN COUNTRIES WHERE SENIORS RELY MORE ON THEIR FAMILIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS IS THE FIRST COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN WELFARE STATE REGIMES AND DIGITAL INCLUSION AMONG SENIORS.","OREBRO UNIV, DEPT POLIT SCI, OREBRO, SWEDEN.","ALEXOPOULOU, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), OREBRO UNIV, DEPT POLIT SCI, OREBRO, SWEDEN.","AASLAND A, 2001, DOI 10.1080/09668130120085029; AIDUKAIT J, 2010; AISSAOUI N, 2022, DOI 10.1108/gkmc-06-2020-0075; ALEXOPOULOU S, 2020; ALEXOPOULOU S, 2020; ALIN H, 2017; ARTS W, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0952872002012002114; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BALLANO S, 2014, DOI 10.15581/003.27.4.147-155; BAMBRA C, 2007, DOI 10.1136/jech.2007.064295; BECK N, 2001, DOI 10.1146/annurev.polisci.4.1.271; BERTIN G, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114086; BIRDSALL W, 2000; BREIT E, 2015, DOI 10.1111/spol.12093; BRITANNICA T EDITORS OF E, 2020; BUHR D, 2017; CASTELLS M, 2002; CASTLES F, 2008, DOI 10.1080/01402380701835140; CAVA-FERRERUELA I, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.12.002; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.11.027; DE VOS J, 2021, DOI 10.1002/ppi.1582; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (, 2020; DIGGOV S, 2020; EICHHORST W, 2017; ESPING-ANDERSEN G, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0958928714556976; ESPINGANDERSON G, 1990; EUROSTAT, 2020; EUROSTAT, 2017; FALCH M, 2007; FENGER H, 2007; FERRERA M, 1996, DOI 10.1177/095892879600600102; FUCHS C, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; GAL J, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0958928710374374; GIANSANTI D, 2021, DOI 10.3390/healthcare9040371; GOMEZ D, 2018, DOI 10.31211/interacoes.n34.2018.a4; GUILLEN M, 2005, DOI 10.1353/sof.2006.0015; HARDEY M, 2009, DOI 10.1093/bjsw/bcp024; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HAYES A, 2007, DOI 10.3758/bf03192961; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; HOEKSTRA J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/14036090310000634; HUTCHESON G, 1999; KAMMER A, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0958928712456572; KRAEMAR K, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00071; LARSEN C, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0010414006295234; LAUZADYTE-TUTLIENE A, 2018, DOI 10.14254/2071-789x.2018/11-1/7; LIAO S, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2022.121607; LIPSET S, 1959, DOI 10.2307/1951731; MARIANO J, 2020, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568972; MARTIN S, 2007, DOI 10.1525/sp.2007.54.1.1; MILLWARD P, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; MUBARAK F, 2015, DOI 10.36251/josi.93; NICCOLI T, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2012.07.024; NIEHAVES B, 2008; NT I, 1998; NYQVIST F, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10433-018-0487-y; OFFE C, 1993; PALME J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.rssm.2006.10.004; PEACOCK S, 2007; PECHAR H, 2011, DOI 10.1057/hep.2010.24; PERRONS D, 2004; BELLINI C, 2019, DOI 10.1108/itp-07-2017-0235; BELLINI C, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3205945; PRINCE M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61347-7; RAMSETTY A, 2020, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocaa078; RASANEN P, 2006, DOI 10.1080/14616690500491423; SACHWEH P, 2012, DOI 10.1093/esr/jcq055; SAINTARNAUD S, 2003; SARIKAKIS K, 2004; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SIVONEN J, 2021, DOI 10.1177/0731121421990053; STRID S, 2021, DOI 10.1177/09589287211002370; SYVERTSEN T, 2014; TAMS S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2014.10.001; TEORELL J, 2020, DOI 10.18157/qogstdjan20; UNITED N, 2018; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DIJK J, 2020; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN LANCKER W, 2021; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; WEST A, 2013, DOI 10.1017/s0047279412001043; WILSON L, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s11205-004-2527-6; YU L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0961000606070600; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1108/itp-01-2013-0022",1,2022,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000828217000001,ISI,OREBRO UNIV,OREBRO UNIV,NA,"ALEXOPOULOU S, 2022, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE","ALEXOPOULOU S, 2022, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE",SWEDEN,10.1108/itp-11-2020-0803,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,NA,WOS

EVERYWHERE, SARS-COV-2 STRUCK HARDEST IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THIS PAPER ASKS WHETHER THE VIRUS'S DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON MORE VULNERABLE GROUPS IS REPLICATED AMONG COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. DATA COME FROM APPROXIMATELY 3800 STUDENTS STUDYING AT NINE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS LOCATED IN SIX DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AROUND THE GLOBE. CONVENTIONAL IMAGERY OF THE 'IVORY TOWER' TREATS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS CLOISTERED ACADEMIC SPACES BEYOND THE 'REAL WORLD.' SUCH IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE PATTERNS OF COVID-19 INEQUITY SEEN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION MIGHT NOT HOLD WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THE COMPOSITION OF THE POST-SECONDARY STUDENT BODY HAS BECOME MORE DIVERSE AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE. THIS COULD MEAN THAT PATTERNS OF INEQUITY FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION MIGHT HOLD, ALTHOUGH PERHAPS AT MUTED STRENGTH, AMONG COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. WE INVESTIGATE THE HIGHER EDUCATION CONTEXT, ASKING HOW THE CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDENTS, SUCH AS THEIR GENDER OR FAMILY BACKGROUND, THEIR DIGITAL ACCESS, AND THEIR LIVING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, IMPACTED THEIR SELF-REPORTED ABILITY TO LEARN.

THAT ASSOCIATION HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OR RELATED TERMINOLOGIES WHOSE CORE CONCEPTUALIZATION IS THE EXCLUSION OF SOME GROUPS FROM THE BENEFITS OF DIGITAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, WITH THE GROWING BREADTH AND DEPTH OF DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, AN EXCLUSION WORLDVIEW IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT. WHAT IS ALSO NEEDED IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW INEQUALITIES ARE CREATED FOR SOME GROUPS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN DIGITAL SYSTEMS. THIS PAPER CREATES SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING, DRAWING FROM IDEAS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STUDIES LITERATURE ON CHRONIC POVERTY TO INDUCTIVELY BUILD A MODEL OF A NEW CONCEPT: 'ADVERSE DIGITAL INCORPORATION', MEANING INCLUSION IN A DIGITAL SYSTEM THAT ENABLES A MORE-ADVANTAGED GROUP TO EXTRACT DISPROPORTIONATE VALUE FROM THE WORK OR RESOURCES OF ANOTHER, LESS-ADVANTAGED GROUP. THIS NEW MODEL WILL ENABLE THOSE INVOLVED WITH DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHY, HOW AND FOR WHOM INEQUALITY CAN EMERGE FROM THE GROWING USE OF DIGITAL SYSTEMS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH. IT CREATES A SYSTEMATIC FRAMEWORK INCORPORATING THE PROCESSES, THE DRIVERS, AND THE CAUSES OF ADVERSE DIGITAL INCORPORATION THAT WILL PROVIDE DETAILED NEW INSIGHTS. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS THAT DERIVE FROM THE MODEL AND ITS EXPOSURE TO THE BROADER COMPONENTS OF POWER THAT SHAPE THE INCLUSIONARY CONNECTION BETWEEN DIGITAL AND INEQUALITY.","UNIV MANCHESTER, GLOBAL DEV INST, CTR DIGITAL DEV, MANCHESTER, LANCS, ENGLAND.","HEEKS, R (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV MANCHESTER, GLOBAL DEV INST, CTR DIGITAL DEV, MANCHESTER, LANCS, ENGLAND.","KARAKARA A, 2022, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2021.1971148; ADAM T, 2019, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2019.1640740; ANDREJEVIC M, 2008, DOI https://; ANTHIS, 2020; ANWAR M, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1024529420914473; ARMENTA A, 2012, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2011.625925; AYANSO A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2010.504698; BARRIENTOS S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/00220388.2013.780043; BASU, 2017; BENIGER JAMES R, 1986; BENNETT, 1981; BRACKING, 2003; BURRELL J, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2053951715622512; CHIN-CHANG H, 2006, DOI 10.1504/ijiem.2006.010915; DE LA C, 2012; DRYDYK J, 2013, DOI 10.1080/17449626.2013.818374; GOMEZ-MORANTES J, 2022, DOI 10.1057/s41287-021-00409-w; FAIRWORK, 2020; FORTIN, 2011; FOSTER C, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00130095.2017.1350104; GRAHAM M, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1024258916687250; GURUMURTHY, 2019; HAMELINK C, 1979; HEARN J, 2012; HEEKS, 2021; HEEKS, 2018; HEEKS, 2021; HEEKS R, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105528; HEEKS R, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1599039; HELMERICH N, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1024529420903289; HICKEY S, 2013; IAZZOLINO G, 2019; ISLAM M, 2021, DOI 10.1177/21582440211021407; IYER N, 2020; JAMES J, 2003; JAVAID A, 2020; KABA B, 2022, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2021.1962234; KHERA, 2019; KHERA R, 2019; KOSTKA, 2018; KUHLMANN, 2015; LEE C, 2019, DOI 10.1108/oir-08-2018-0231; LIANG F, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.183; LOH Y, 2019, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2018.1520190; MAEDA, 2019; MANNAN, 2021; MASIERO S, 2021, DOI 10.1111/isj.12351; MASIERO S, 2018, DOI 10.1002/isd2.12053; MATHEWS P, 2017, DOI 10.1080/13545701.2017.1293835; MCCARTHY J, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03066150.2010.512460; MEAGHER K, 2021, DOI 10.1111/dech.12672; MEAGHER K, 2018, DOI 10.1057/s41287-017-0113-4; MEAGHER K, 2013, DOI 10.1017/asr.2013.79; MISHRA D, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s41027-020-00277-8; MURPHY J, 2015; NAGAN W, 2014; NAGAN W, 2010; NATARAJAN N, 2021, DOI 10.1111/dech.12623; OKUNOLA O, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.02.002; OLDEKOP J, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105044; PAL A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2019.1701969; PHILLIPS N, 2013, DOI 10.1080/03085147.2012.718630; PICK JAMES B, 2008, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20095; PRIEZKALNS, 2020; QIU J, 2009; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-32706-4; RAGNEDDA M, 2020; RAGNEDDA M, 2013; RAMALINGAM B, 2016; ROBERTS SARAH T, 2019; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; SCHMIDT, 2017; SCHOR J, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11186-020-09408-y; SCHWARE R, 1988, DOI 10.1080/02681102.1988.9627121; SEN A, 2000, DOI 10.1.1.100.1010; SHIELDS P, 1989, DOI 10.1080/01972243.1989.9960068; SINGH, 2018; SINGH P, 2021, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1668459; SLAMECKA V, 1985, DOI 10.1002/asi.4630360308; TAKAVARASHA, 2018; TAYLOR L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.07.002; UNITED N, 2020; VAN DIJK J, 2020; VASHISTHA A, 2019, DOI 10.1145/3290605.3300302; YOO C, 2020; ZHENG Y, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.infoorg.2021.100341",0,2022,DEVELOPMENT STUDIES; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000821742900001,ISI,UNIV MANCHESTER,UNIV MANCHESTER,NA,"HEEKS R, 2022, INFORM TECHNOL DEV","HEEKS R, 2022, INFORM TECHNOL DEV",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1080/02681102.2022.2068492,NA,DEVELOPMENT STUDIES; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",UK ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL'S GLOBAL CHALLENGES RESEARCH FUND [ES/S00081X/1],WOS

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE CHANGING FACTORS THAT SHAPE PIU ACTIVATION. SPECIFICALLY, IT FOCUSES ON THE CHANGING ROLE OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS AND FAMILY SUPPORT IN INTERNET NONUSERS' ACCESS TO ONLINE SERVICES BY COMPARING FACTORS ENGENDERING ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN PIU IN 2009 AND 2018. THE RESULTS FROM MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA FROM TWO NATIONWIDE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES COLLECTED NINE YEARS APART IN SLOVENIA SHOW THAT BOTH SETS OF FACTORS HAVE LOST THEIR EXPLANATORY POWER OVER TIME. AT THE SAME TIME, INTERNET NONUSERS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCENTRATED IN THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS OF PEOPLE. SPECIFICALLY, THE DECREASING IMPORTANCE OF (GRAND)CHILDREN AS PROXY USERS AND THE NEWLY EMERGING IMPORTANCE OF SPOUSES OR PARTNERS REPRESENTS A SHIFT AWAY FROM INTERGENERATIONAL SUPPORT AND TOWARD INTRAGENERATIONAL SUPPORT IN REGARDS TO WHO NONUSERS RELY ON WHEN ASKING FOR HELP WITH ONLINE TASKS AND SERVICES.","UNIV LJUBLJANA, CTR SOCIAL INFORMAT, KARDELJEVA PLOSCAD 5, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.;  UNIV N CAROLINA, DEPT COMMUN STUDIES, CHARLOTTE, NC USA.","GROSELJ, D (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LJUBLJANA, CTR SOCIAL INFORMAT, KARDELJEVA PLOSCAD 5, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.","ANDERSON M, 2017; BAKARDJIEVA M, 2005; BLANK G, 2013; BOURDIEU P, 2001; CAMPOS-CASTILLO C, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0894439314547617; CHANG J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01634372.2014.913754; CHARNESS N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01647.x; COLEMAN J, 1990; CORREA T, 2019; CORREA T, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1461444813506975; CORREA T, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12067; COURTOIS C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814562162; CZAJA S, 2020, DOI 10.1093/geroni/igaa052; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DOLNICAR V, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.12.005; DUTTON J, 2020, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3522083; DUTTON W, 2005; EUROPEAN C, 2019, DOI 10.2775/80086; EUROPEAN C, 2021; EUROSTAT, 2009; EUROSTAT, 2021; EYNON R, 2012; EYNON R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.942344; FARRINGTON J, 2015; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GALLISTL V, 2020, DOI 10.17645/si.v8i2.2607; GALPERIN H, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818799996; GRISHCHENKO N, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102004; GROSELJ D, 2020, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2020.1862377; GROSELJ D, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2018.07.004; GURUNG R, 2003, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.18.3.487; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; HALE T, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0002764210361685; HAMPTON K, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0094306118805415; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2013; HARGITTAI E, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0617-5; HARWOOD J, 2000, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.2000.tb02863.x; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1203454; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2012.0257; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HUNSAKER A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/2378023119887866; ISSP RESEARCH G, 2019, DOI 10.4232/1.13322; JARKE J, 2021, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-52873-7; KALMIJN M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.alcr.2012.08.002; KOKKONIS E, 2018; MATTHEWS K, 2019, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x18000326; NELISSEN S, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1281993; NEWLANDS G, 2018, DOI 10.5210/fm.v23i11.8159; OFCOM, 2009; OFCOM, 2020; PATERNOSTER R, 1998, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-9125.1998.tb01268.x; PETROVI S, 2018; QUAN-HAASE A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0002764218777572; RAGNEDDA M, 2020; RAINIE L, 2017; RAINS S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/03637751.2016.1228252; REISDORF B C, 2012; REISDORF B, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1461444820928051; REISDORF B, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444815621539; RICHARDSON J, 2018; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ROSSITER-BASE, 2019; SELWYN N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0894439304271553; SELWYN N, 2016; SISTAT, 2021; TAIPALE, 2019; UNESCO INSTITUTE FOR S, 2011; UNITED N, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DIJK J, 2020; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; WEISER E, 2000, DOI 10.1089/109493100316012; WHITE P, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2011.611816; YATES S, 2015, DOI 10.5153/sro.3751; ZICKUHR K, 2013; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x",1,2022,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000808157500001,ISI,UNIV LJUBLJANA;UNIV N CAROLINA,UNIV LJUBLJANA,NA,"GROSELJ D, 2022, INF SOC","GROSELJ D, 2022, INF SOC",SLOVENIA;USA,10.1080/01972243.2022.2080782,NA,COMMUNICATION; INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,NA,WOS

OLDER ADULTS ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK OF INTERNET-RELATED SOCIAL EXCLUSION, ESPECIALLY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION OF THE CURRENT SCOPING REVIEW WERE: WHAT KIND OF STRATEGIES CAN REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND TECHNOSTRESS OF OLDER ADULT EMPLOYEES AND CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR INCLUSION AND RETENTION IN THE WORKING MARKET DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC? METHODOLOGY: THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE ARKSEY AND O'MALLEY FRAMEWORK FOR SCOPING REVIEWS. THE SIX-STAGE FRAMEWORK INCLUDES: IDENTIFYING RESEARCH QUESTIONS, IDENTIFYING RELEVANT STUDIES, STUDY SELECTION, CHARTING THE DATA, SUMMARIZING AND REPORTING THE RESULTS, AND A CONSULTATION EXERCISE. A SCOPING REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING FIVE HUMANISTIC AND SOCIAL ELECTRONIC DATABASES - CINAHL WITH FULL TEXT, EBSCO, MEDLINE, SOCLNDEX, WEB OF SCIENCE - AND ADDITIONALLY HAND-SEARCHES PERFORMED ON GOOGLE SCHOLAR. THE SEARCH WAS LIMITED TO STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM JANUARY 2020 TO MARCH 2021. AFTER APPLYING INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, 10 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: THIS REVIEW SHOWS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGIES ARE: 1) ICT EDUCATIONAL TRAINING COURSES; 2) SOCIAL DIALOG; 3) BUILDING INCLUSIVE WORKPLACES; 4) IMPLEMENTATION OF SUCCESSFUL 'AGING IN PUBLIC' POLICIES. OUR RESULTS ARE BENEFICIAL FOR INDIVIDUALS, ORGANIZATIONS, INDUSTRIES AND DIFFERENT SOCIETIES BY SHOWING HOW CONCRETE STRATEGIES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AT MULTIPLE LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS FOUND THAT ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FACED BY OLDER ADULT EMPLOYEES DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS AND TECHNOSTRESS IS SOCIAL DIALOG BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES, WHICH CAN BE A SOURCE OF INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS (E.G. PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS OR TAILORED SUPPORT). SOCIAL DIALOG SHOULD INCLUDE ACTIVE COOPERATION WITH OLDER ADULT WORKERS - ASKING WHAT THEY NEED AND WANT - TO ENABLE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT THROUGH TRAINING.","MATEJ BEL UNIV, FAC ECON, DEPT ECON, BANSKA BYSTRICA, SLOVAKIA.;  KRISTIANIA UNIV COLL, SCH HLTH SCI, DEPT HLTH & EXERCISE, OSLO, NORWAY.","SEBERINI, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), MATEJ BEL UNIV, FAC ECON, DEPT ECON, BANSKA BYSTRICA, SLOVAKIA.","ARKSEY H, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1364557032000119616; BUTTERICK M, 2021, DOI 10.1111/1748-8583.12344; CHOUDRIE J, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10796-021-10126-8; COIBION O, 2020, DOI 10.3386/w27017; COLLINGS D, 2021, DOI 10.1111/joms.12695; ESTEBAN-NAVARRO M, 2020, DOI 10.3390/informatics7040054; FISCHL C, 2020, DOI 10.1080/11038128.2020.1760347; GELL N, 2015, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnt166; HALVORSEN C, 2020, DOI 10.1080/01634372.2020.1774832; HARRIS K, 2022, DOI 10.1108/itp-07-2019-0348; HOPEWELL S, 2007, DOI 10.1002/14651858.mr000010.pub3; KUMAR A, 2021, DOI 10.3389/fcimb.2021.596201; LEE J, 2021; LEVAC D, 2010, DOI 10.1186/1748-5908-5-69; MACEVICIUTE E, 2018, DOI 10.28945/4117; MANNHEIM I, 2019, DOI 10.3390/ijerph16193718; MAZZUCATO M, 2020, DOI 10.1093/oxrep/graa031; MOHER D, 2015, DOI 10.1186/2046-4053-4-1; MONAHAN C, 2020, DOI 10.1037/amp0000699; NIMROD G, 2022, DOI 10.1080/13607863.2020.1861213; OECD, 2017; PASSARELLI B, 2016, DOI 10.4018/978-1-4666-8740-0; PETERS M, 2015, DOI 10.1097/xeb.0000000000000050; ROLANDI E, 2020, DOI 10.1002/alz.047562; SCHEJTER A, 2015; SEIFERT A, 2018, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2019.1574415; SUN Z, 2020, DOI 10.3390/ijerph17186542; TARAFDAR M, 2010, DOI 10.2753/mis0742-1222270311; TOMCZYK L, 2022, DOI 10.1080/02701960.2020.1824913; TRICCO A, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s12874-016-0116-4; UNITED N, 2017; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VINKERS C, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2020.05.003; WATSON K, 2018; ZIEMBA E, 2019, DOI 10.1108/itp-02-2018-0090",0,2022,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000814797700001,ISI,MATEJ BEL UNIV;KRISTIANIA UNIV COLL,MATEJ BEL UNIV,NA,"SEBERINI A, 2022, ORGANIZACIJA","SEBERINI A, 2022, ORGANIZACIJA",NORWAY;SLOVAKIA,10.2478/orga-2022-0007,NA,MANAGEMENT,0,SCIENDO,"RESEARCH AGENCY OF THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE, RESEARCH AND SPORT OF THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC [VEGA 1/0668/20]",WOS

WE INVESTIGATE THE MIXED EFFECT OF THE HOME-SHARING BUSINESS ON THE INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF URBAN AND RURAL AREAS WITH A UNIQUE DATASET AND STAGGERED DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATIONS. OUR EMPIRICAL RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE HOME-SHARING BUSINESS POTENTIALLY ALLEVIATES THE INEQUALITY BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS REGARDING THE TOURISM AND REAL ESTATE INDUSTRIES, WITH MORE FAVORABLE INFLUENCES FOR THE TOURISM REVENUE AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN RURAL AREAS. HOWEVER, IT TEMPORARILY INCREASES THE INEQUALITY IN SOCIAL BENEFITS BY INCREASING THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF THE URBAN POPULATION.

AFF.,ARTICLE,NA,POLITICS; MEDIA; NIGERIA; PUBLICS; PARTICIPATION; DEMOCRACY; WHATSAPP; AFRICA; PARTY,"SOCIAL MEDIA MISINFORMATION IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING GLOBAL PROBLEM. YET, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW MISINFORMATION SPREADS ACROSS BROADER MEDIA ECOSYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WITH VARYING INTERNET ACCESS AND CONNECTIVITY. DRAWING ON RESEARCH IN NORTHERN GHANA, WE SEEK TO ADDRESS THIS GAP. WE ARGUE THAT 'PAVEMENT MEDIA'-THE EVERYDAY COMMUNICATION OF CURRENT AFFAIRS THROUGH DISCUSSIONS IN MARKETPLACES, PLACES OF WORSHIP, BARS, AND THE LIKE AND THROUGH A RANGE OF NON-CONVERSATIONAL AND VISUAL PRACTICES SUCH AS SONGS, SERMONS, AND GRAFFITI-IS A KEY LINK IN A BROADER MEDIA ECOSYSTEM. VIBRANT PAVEMENT AND TRADITIONAL MEDIA ALLOW FOR INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA TO QUICKLY CROSS INTO OFFLINE SPACES, CREATING A DISTINCTION NOT OF THE CONNECTED AND DISCONNECTED BUT OF FIRST-HAND AND INDIRECT SOCIAL MEDIA USERS. THIS PAPER SETS OUT HOW SOCIAL, TRADITIONAL, AND PAVEMENT MEDIA FORM A COMPLEX AND DEEPLY GENDERED AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY STRATIFIED MEDIA ECOSYSTEM AND INVESTIGATES ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW CITIZENS DIFFERENTIALLY ENCOUNTER, PROCESS, AND RESPOND TO MISINFORMATION. BASED ON THE FINDINGS, WE ARGUE THAT EFFORTS INTENDED TO COMBAT THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THE WESTERN-CENTRED CONCEPTION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES MEDIA AND TAKE DIFFERENT LOCAL MODALITIES OF MEDIA ACCESS AND FACT-CHECKING INTO ACCOUNT.","UNIV EXETER, POLIT, EXERTER, ENGLAND.;  UNIV WARWICK, COMPARAT POLIT, COVENTRY, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND.;  BAYREUTH INT GRAD SCH AFRICAN STUDIES, BAYREUTH, GERMANY.","GADJANOVA, E (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV EXETER, POLIT, EXERTER, ENGLAND.","AFROBAROMETER, 2022; AHIABENU II K, 2018; AKPOJIVI U, 2014, DOI 10.1080/02560054.2014.959980; ANKRAH DANIEL A, 2020; ARTHUR P, 2010, DOI 10.1080/14662041003672510; BARBER K, 1987; BAWA S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/01900692.2012.757620; BOB-MILLIAR G M, 2014; BOB-MILLIAR G, 2019, DOI 10.1080/21622671.2018.1503091; BOB-MILLIAR G, 2012, DOI 10.1080/13510347.2011.605998; BUTE S, 2014; CHEESEMAN N, 2020, DOI 10.1353/jod.2020.0037; DEACON G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/02589001.2017.1287345; DIAMOND L, 2010; DWYER, 2019; DZISAH W, 2018, DOI 10.1080/23743670.2018.1452774; EKSTROM Y, 2012, DOI 10.2478/nor-2013-0033; ELLIS S, 1989, DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.afraf.a098185; FRIMPONG A, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s11109-020-09632-3; GADJANOVA E, 2019; GADJANOVA E, 2017, DOI 10.1017/s0022278x17000416; GADZEKPO A, 2011; GAGLIARDONE I, 2019, DOI 10.1080/17531055.2018.1548208; GEER J, 1991, DOI 10.1086/269268; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; GYIMAH-BOADI E, 2009; HACKETT R, 1998, DOI 10.1163/157006698x00026; HASSAN I, 2021; JENKINS H, 2006; KAREKWAIVANANE G, 2019; KATACHIE S, 2017; KONDOWE R, 2021; LANGER A, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1940161220925023; MACGAFFEY W, 2006, DOI 10.1017/s0022278x05001424; MACLEAN L, 2004, DOI 10.1017/s0022278x04000412; MADRID-MORALES D, 2021; MANJI, 2020; MANO W, 2011; MARE A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/23808985.2019.1623060; MEYER B, 2011; MEYER B, 2006; MUINDI B, 2018, DOI 10.1080/23743670.2018.1445654; MUSTAPHA M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/03056244.2017.1313731; SELNES F, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0163443719900353; NOTHIAS T, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0163443719890530; NUGENT P, 2001, DOI 10.1093/afraf/100.400.405; NYAMNJOH F, 2005; NYAMNJOH FRANCIS B, 2004; OMANGA D, 2019, DOI 10.1080/17531055.2018.1548211; ORJI N, 2019; OSBORN M, 2008, DOI 10.1080/17531050802094836; OVADIA J, 2011, DOI 10.1080/00083968.2011.10541057; PORTLAND C, 2016; SANNY J, 2021; SASU DORIS D, 2022; SPITULNIK D, 2002; SRINIVASAN S, 2019, DOI 10.1080/17531055.2018.1547259; STATISTA, 2021; TETTEY J, 2019; TETTEY W, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2017.05.012; TETTEY W, 2011; TONAH S, 2012; VAN GYAMPO RANSFORD E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/09744053.2017.1329806; VOGELS EMILY A, 2022; WAHUTU J, 2019, DOI 10.1080/23743670.2019.1628794; WASSERMAN H, 2019, DOI 10.1080/23743670.2019.1627230; WASSERMAN H, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15405702.2011.562097; WASSERMAN H, 2011; WILLEMS W, 2016; WILLIS, 2020",0,2022,AREA STUDIES; GOVERNMENT & LAW,WOS:000788625000001,ISI,UNIV EXETER;UNIV WARWICK;BAYREUTH INT GRAD SCH AFRICAN STUDIES,UNIV EXETER,NA,"GADJANOVA E, 2022, AFR AFF","GADJANOVA E, 2022, AFR AFF",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;GERMANY,10.1093/afraf/adac009,NA,AREA STUDIES; POLITICAL SCIENCE,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,GLOBAL CHALLENGES RESEARCH FUND FROM THE COLLEGE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER; COLLEGE OF SOCIAL SCIENCES AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EXETER,WOS

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER APPLIES THE BOURDIEUSIAN E-CAPITAL PERSPECTIVE TO CREATE A THEORY-BASED FRAMEWORK. THE FRAMEWORK WAS USED TO GUIDE A SURVEY DESIGN TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S ""SOCIAL MEDIA-ASSISTED REUSE"" AT THE MICRO-SCALE IN HELSINKI, FINLAND. FINDINGS THE PAPER ARGUES THAT A NEW FORM OF CAPITAL EMERGES WHEN INDIVIDUALS UTILIZE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN CORRESPONDENCE TO THEIR GOALS TO GAIN ADDED VALUE THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ARDUOUS TO GAIN WITHOUT THE DIGITAL REALM. THE SURVEY INDICATES THAT THE RESPONDENTS UTILIZE THE DIGITAL SPACE - SET OBJECTIVES AND GAIN CAPITAL-RELATED OUTCOMES - IN CORRESPONDENCE TO THEIR DIFFERING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL POSITIONS AND RELATED RESOURCES IN- AND OUTSIDE OF THE DIGITAL REALM. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS IF DIGITAL SPACES - DUE TO SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND UNDERLYING POWER STRUCTURES - BECOME INCREASINGLY STRATIFIED, THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON HOW INDIVIDUALS FROM DIFFERING BACKGROUNDS GAIN ACCUMULATED FORMS OF CAPITAL THROUGH THE DIGITAL REALM. THE QUESTION IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE FOR BATTLING INEQUALITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER ENHANCES AND SYNTHESIZES RECENT DISCUSSIONS ON DIFFERENT FORMS OF CAPITAL AND OUTCOMES OF THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND PRESENTS A COMBINED ""E-CAPITAL-DIGITAL DIVIDE"" FRAMEWORK THAT OFFERS A MORE COMPLETE AGENDA FOR INVESTIGATING THE FINELY NUANCED LINKS BETWEEN THE INPUTS, OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY USE.","VTT TECH RES CTR FINLAND LTD, ESPOO, FINLAND.;  UNIV EASTERN FINLAND, JOENSUU, FINLAND.","MERISALO, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), VTT TECH RES CTR FINLAND LTD, ESPOO, FINLAND.","AMICHAI-HAMBURGER Y, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.02.002; BAUM F, 2014, DOI 10.1093/heapro/das062; BECKER GARY S, 1964, DOI 10.2307/3499575; BLANK G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BOEING G, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0308518x19869678; BOURDIEU P, 2010; BOURDIEU P, 1984; GOMEZ D, 2019, DOI 10.1080/13676261.2018.1559283; GOMEZ D, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1461444820933252; CARLSON A, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00909882.2018.1437279; CHEN W, 2013, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2012.739265; CHINN M, 2007, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; CHOI C, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0161-8938(02)00202-8; CHOI C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.econlet.2009.03.028; CHOI J, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1461444820925800; COLEMAN J, 1988, DOI 10.1086/228943; CORREA T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1084023; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DUTTON W, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1353640; ELLISON N, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x; ELLISON N, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814543998; FANG M, 2019, DOI 10.1093/geront/gny037; FUNNELL S, 2011; GILBERT MELISSA R, 2011; GRAHAM M, 2013; GRAHAM M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/146499341001100303; HANKIVSKY O, 2014; HARAMBAM J, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2012.687006; HARGITTAI E, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(99)00050-6; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HATLEVIK O, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.11.015; HELSINKI REGION S, 2019; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1203454; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; IGNATOW G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1301519; INKINEN T, 2018, DOI 10.1080/09654313.2018.1448756; JULIEN C, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0038038514535862; KIURU J, 2019, DOI 10.1080/10630732.2019.1579513; LEE Y, 2021, DOI 10.1108/itp-11-2018-0541; LEGUINA A, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.lisr.2021.101103; LEGUINA A, 2021, DOI 10.1177/14614448211015979; LI F, 2014, DOI 10.1068/b39010; MANDARANO L, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0885412210394102; MCGILLIVRAY D, 2020, DOI https://; MEHRA B, 2004, DOI 10.1177/146144804047513; MERISALO M, 2016; MERISALO M, 2014; PARK S, 2017, DOI 10.1057/978-1-137-59332-0; PERAZZO F, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.caeo.2020.100015; PUTNAM R, 1995; RAGNEDDA M, 2018; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819869604; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; RIQUELME H, 2018, DOI 10.1108/itp-03-2017-0079; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROGERS EVERETT M, 1983; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SEALE J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.007; SEALE J, 2013, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2012.670644; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; SVENDSEN G L H, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2010.06.012; TSATSOU P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2012.670190; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817715282; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2017, DOI 10.1002/9781118783764.wbieme0043; WOZNIAK G, 1987, DOI 10.2307/145869; ZOOK M, 2006, DOI 10.1002/aris.1440400109",0,2022,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000800894500001,ISI,VTT TECH RES CTR FINLAND LTD;UNIV EASTERN FINLAND,VTT TECH RES CTR FINLAND LTD,NA,"MERISALO M, 2022, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE","MERISALO M, 2022, INF TECHNOL PEOPLE",FINLAND;FINLAND,10.1108/itp-08-2021-0594,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,STRATEGIC RESEARCH COUNCIL AT THE ACADEMY OF FINLAND [303617],WOS

BASED ON THESE COMPONENTS/SUBINDICES, WE CONSTRUCTED AN INDEX OF DIGITAL INCLUSION FOR THE RUSSIAN CONTEXT AND TESTED IT ON A REPRESENTATIVE NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 765 INTERNET USERS (596 RUSSIANS, 196 YAKUTS). OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT RUSSIANS USE MORE PLATFORMS FOR ONLINE ACCESS (MOBILE PHONES, LAPTOPS, CONSOLES, SMART TV, ETC.) THAN YAKUTS AND ACCESS THE INTERNET THROUGH A BIGGER NUMBER OF LOCATIONS, NOT BEING LIMITED TO HOME AND/OR OFFICE ONLY. THEY ALSO HAVE HIGHER LEVEL OF SOCIAL, TECHNICAL, AND CREATIVE ICT SKILLS, AND DEMONSTRATE HIGHER LEVELS OF DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT AND OVERALL DIGITAL INCLUSION. WE ARGUE THAT THE EXPLANATION HERE LIES FIRST OF ALL IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL DOMAIN, THAT IS TRADITIONAL LOCATION OF ETHNIC MINORITY (YAKUTS) IN A REGION THAT IS LESS DIGITALLY ADVANTAGED IN TERMS OF INTERNET ACCESS, COST, SPEED, AND OTHER FACTORS (FAR EASTERN FEDERAL DISTRICT), AND IS NOT RELATED TO ETHNICITY ITSELF. WE THINK THEREFORE THAT THIS STUDY IS A GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF HOW THE FIRST AND THE SECOND LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE INTERRELATE AND INFLUENCE EACH OTHER, LEADING TO A SITUATION WHEN PEOPLE WITH LOWER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND ICTS HAVE LOWER SKILLS AND COMPETENCES TO USE THEM, THEREFORE RISKING TO BECOME DIGITALLY AND ALSO SOCIALLY EXCLUDED.","LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;  FAR EASTERN FED UNIV, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.;  HIGHER SCH ECON, FAC BIOL & BIOTECHNOL, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.","GLADKOVA, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV, FAC JOURNALISM, 9 MOKHOVAYA ST, MOSCOW 125009, RUSSIA.","BOKHAN T, 2016; BRODOVSKAYA E, 2013; BYKOV I, 2011; CARMI E, 2020, DOI 10.14763/2020.2.1481; CHOUDRIE J, 2018; DANILOV A, 2019; DROBIZHEVA L, 2002; DUNAS D, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17447143.2020.1751648; FEDOROV Y, 2019; GARIFULLIN V, 2018; GLADKOVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17447143.2020.1745212; GLADKOVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1108/oir-04-2019-0121; GRIMES A, 2019, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3492833; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HELSPER E, 2008; LIN C, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.04.054; LIVINGSTONE S, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809342697; MATSAGANIS M, 2011; MERVYN K, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.877952; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819869604; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; RAHIM S, 2011; RYKOV Y, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-69784-0_6; TSATSOU P, 2020, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2019.1636136; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; VARTANOVA E, 2018, DOI 10.30547/mediaalmanah.5.2018.812; VARTANOVA E, 2018, DOI 10.17150/2308-6203.2018.7(1).165-176; VARTANOVA E, 2009; VOLCHENKO O, 2016, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2016.5.10; YU S, 2018",0,2022,COMMUNICATION,WOS:000786628000001,ISI,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV;FAR EASTERN FED UNIV;HIGHER SCH ECON,LOMONOSOV MOSCOW STATE UNIV,NA,"GLADKOVA A, 2022, EUR J COMMUN","GLADKOVA A, 2022, EUR J COMMUN",RUSSIA;RUSSIA;RUSSIA,10.1177/02673231221093185,NA,COMMUNICATION,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,PRESIDENTIAL GRANT COUNCIL FOR THE STATE SUPPORT OF YOUNG RUSSIAN SCHOLARS [MK-795.2020.6],WOS

USING DATA FROM THE SPANISH NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS (2020) WE TRY TO FIND OUT WHETHER INTERNET USERS' EDUCATIONAL, MATERIAL, AND DIGITAL RESOURCES FACILITATE THE ADOPTION OF THIS INTERNET USE WHILE HELPING TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE FROM IT (DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, PROBLEMS IN CHARGING, ETC.). FOR THIS PURPOSE, A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL AND A POISSON REGRESSION ARE IMPLEMENTED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN LINE WITH DIGITAL INEQUALITY ASSUMPTIONS, INTERNET USERS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF RESOURCES INCORPORATE E-COMMERCE MORE EASILY INTO THEIR DAILY LIVES AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO AVOID THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.","UNIV SALAMANCA, DEPT SOCIOL & COMUNICAC, SALAMANCA, SPAIN.","DE MARCO, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV SALAMANCA, DEPT SOCIOL & COMUNICAC, SALAMANCA, SPAIN.","AKHTER S, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0167-4870(02)00171-x; ANTINO M, 2016; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BARKHI R, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10799-007-0021-y; BAUBONIENE Z, 2015, DOI 10.13165/st-15-5-1-06; BLANK G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BUCHI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604154; BUHTZ K, 2014; GOMEZ D, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1461444820933252; CHEN L, 2004; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DENG Z, 2010, DOI 10.1504/ijmc.2010.034937; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DODEL M, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2018.1428652; ECOMMERCE E, 2021; ELEONORA P, 2019; EUROPEAN C, 2020; EUROSTAT, 2021; GELDERMAN C, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2011.06.003; GOLDSMITH E, 2000; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HASSANI S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.007; HELSPER E, 2021; HELSPER E, 2019, DOI https://; HO S, 2008, DOI 10.1108/10662240810897826; IYER L S, 2002; LEONARD L, 2001; LISSITSA S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/13511610.2015.1081557; LUPAC P, 2018; MARGOLIS M, 2000; MICHELI M, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jices-02-2018-0014; PEREZ-AMARAL T, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2019.101888; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; RAGNEDDA M, 2018; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; ROBINSON L, 2012, DOI 10.4000/reset.135; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; SCHEERDER A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444819844299; SERRANO-CINCA C, 2018, DOI 10.1111/ssqu.12504; SHANTHI R, 2015; VALAREZO A, 2020; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014; VAN DEURSEN A, 2012, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2012.670086; VAN DEURSEN A, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-85204-9_17; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.001",0,2022,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000823574000004,ISI,UNIV SALAMANCA,UNIV SALAMANCA,NA,"DE MARCO S, 2022, REV INT SOCIOL","DE MARCO S, 2022, REV INT SOCIOL",SPAIN,10.3989/ris.2022.80.2.20.98,NA,SOCIOLOGY,0,CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS-CSIC,NA,WOS

THE METHODOLOGY USED IS MIXED, ANALYZING THE USE GAP AND DIGITAL TRAINING OF FAMILIES THROUGH A QUESTIONNAIRE WITH 1,228 PARTICIPATING FAMILIES AND A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WITH 20 PARTICIPANTS. AMONG THE RESULTS, THE PROFILE OF FAMILIES VERY INVOLVED WITH THE TRAINING OF THEIR CHILDREN STANDS OUT, WITH SUFFICIENT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO FACE THE MODELS OF DISTANCE EDUCATION. WHEN ANALYZING THE SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FAMILIES, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND IN FAMILY RECONCILIATION ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY UNIT. ACCESS TO COMPLEMENTARY EDUCATIONAL CONTENT VARIES ACCORDING TO THE AGE OF THE PARENTS, THEIR ACADEMIC TRAINING OR PROFESSIONAL AREA. THE MONITORING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATIONAL WEBSITE ""I LEARN AT HOME"" SHOWS DIFFERENCES ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OF THE STUDENT.

IT ARGUES THAT LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY CAN INSPIRE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE, ALLOWING CITIES TO BE ENVISIONED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DIGITAL INCLUSION AND EQUITY, THEREBY FOSTERING A BARRIER-FREE, DIGITAL URBAN LOGIC.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, FAC INFORMAT SCI, AV COMPLUTENSE,3 CIUDAD UNIV, MADRID 28040, SPAIN.;  GEORGETOWN UNIV, SCH FOREIGN SERV, 37TH & O ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20057 USA.","KOLOTOUCHKINA, O (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, FAC INFORMAT SCI, AV COMPLUTENSE,3 CIUDAD UNIV, MADRID 28040, SPAIN.","ABELLA A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2017.01.011; AGREN K, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819888398; ALPER M, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816686323; ANASTASIU I, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-2694-3_13; BAYKURT B, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1354856520913405; DOBRANSKY K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600751298; GRAHAM S, 2002, DOI 10.1080/00420980220099050; HATUKA T, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2020.102978; KANDT J, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2020.102992; KITCHIN R, 2019, DOI 10.1080/24694452.2018.1497475; KITCHIN R, 2016, DOI 10.1098/rsta.2016.0115; KOLOTOUCHKINA O, 2018, DOI 10.1057/s41254-017-0078-2; LIM C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2018.04.011; LIN Z, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818774866; LLORENTE-BARROSO C, 2021, DOI 10.3390/ijerph18083923; LORD J, 2014, DOI 10.1093/jhuman/hut034; LUSSIER-DESROCHERS D, 2017, DOI 10.5817/cp2017-1-1; NOWELL L, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1609406917733847; OECD, 2020; PEW RESEARCH C, 2021; RAJA D, 2016; TREVISAN F, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2056305120913909; UNITED NATIONS NDUNITED N, 2015; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VANOLO A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0042098013494427; WARF B, 2001, DOI 10.1068/b2691",3,2022,URBAN STUDIES,WOS:000753655000002,ISI,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID;GEORGETOWN UNIV,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,NA,"KOLOTOUCHKINA O, 2022, CITIES","KOLOTOUCHKINA O, 2022, CITIES",SPAIN;USA,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103613,NA,URBAN STUDIES,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,"(MINISTRY FOR SCIENCE AND INNOVATION, SPAIN) [RTI2018-096733-B-I00]",WOS

RIGHTS PRACT.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; HIGHER EDUCATION; ONLINE LEARNING; STUDENT SURVEY,NA,"THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE AUTHORS' UNIVERSITY COURSE ON 'HUMAN RIGHTS AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY', DESIGNED TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN A HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF THE APPLICATION OF INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW TO THE DIGITAL UNIVERSE. IN ADDITION TO THE INTELLECTUAL PREMISES OF OUR COURSE, THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE NOTABLE SHIFT IN TEACHING PRACTICE DURING THE START OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS THE AUTHORS MOVED FROM CLASSROOM TO ONLINE INSTRUCTION. WE ARGUE THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC MANY STUDENTS EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF EQUAL ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION BASED ON MERIT OR CAPACITY, A HUMAN RIGHT GUARANTEED BY THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION AND THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS. IN FACT, STUDENTS RECOGNIZED HOW ONLINE EDUCATION, AT LEAST IN THIS SPECIFIC CONTEXT, MAY HAVE EXACERBATED SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THE ANALYSIS OF A SMALL SURVEY OF OUR STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF ONLINE LEARNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. BASED ON THE AUTHORS' OBSERVATIONS AND SURVEY RESULTS, OUR ARTICLE POINTS TO THREE SALIENT FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THE QUALITY AND FAIRNESS OF ONLINE EDUCATION DURING THE LOCKDOWN PERIOD: THE ABSENCE OF IN-PERSON, EXPERIENCED HUMAN FEEDBACK TO HONE CRITICAL THINKING; ACCESS (OR LACK THEREOF) TO FUNCTIONING TECHNOLOGY; AND COMPROMISED STUDENT ATTENTION. WE HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS EXPERIENCE, AND HOW A HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK MAY HELP BOTH PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS IDENTIFY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ONLINE LEARNING IS MORE LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO GUARANTEE EQUAL ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION.","AMER UNIV PARIS, PARIS, FRANCE.;  AMER UNIV PARIS, INT LAW & POLIT, PARIS, FRANCE.;  AMER UNIV PARIS, GRAD PROGRAMME INT AFFAIRS, PARIS, FRANCE.;  AMER UNIV PARIS, WORKING GRP HUMAN RIGHTS, PARIS, FRANCE.","RODA, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), AMER UNIV PARIS, PARIS, FRANCE.","AKERKAR S, 2020, DOI 10.1093/jhuman/huaa032; CAMPION J, 2020, DOI 10.1016/s2215-0366(20)30240-6; DUDAI R, 2019, DOI 10.1093/jhuman/huz027; EUROPEAN U, 2018; GREEDY P, 2020, DOI 10.1093/jhuman/huaa036; LANHAM R, 2006; MOLENAAR I, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2011.12.006; PERRY, 2015; PERRY S, 2014; PERRY S, 2017; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; PROTAIS, 2020; RODA C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2005.12.005; RODA C, 2011, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511974519.002; RODA C, 2019; RODA C, 2019; RODA C, 2013; RODA C, 2014; RODA C, 2011; SON C, 2020, DOI 10.2196/21279; UNESCO, 2020; UNESCO, 2020; VEGAS E, 2020",0,2022,INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS; GOVERNMENT & LAW,WOS:000768337400001,ISI,AMER UNIV PARIS;AMER UNIV PARIS;AMER UNIV PARIS;AMER UNIV PARIS,AMER UNIV PARIS,NA,"RODA C, 2022, J HUM RIGHTS PRACT","RODA C, 2022, J HUM RIGHTS PRACT",FRANCE;FRANCE;FRANCE;FRANCE,10.1093/jhuman/huab037,NA,INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS; LAW; POLITICAL SCIENCE,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,NA,WOS

EDUC.,ARTICLE,ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN (AGYW); EDUCATION; COVID-19; SOUTH AFRICA; SCHOOL CLOSURES; EDUCATIONAL RESILIENCE; DIGITAL DIVIDE,NA,"GENDER RELATED VULNERABILITIES AND INEQUALITIES PLACE FEMALE LEARNERS AT HIGH RISK OF SCHOOL DISENGAGEMENT DUE TO COVID-19 DISRUPTIONS. UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS OF SCHOOL CLOSURES AND EDUCATIONAL DISRUPTIONS ON FEMALE LEARNERS IN SOUTH AFRICA IS CRITICAL TO INFORM APPROPRIATE, GENDER-SENSITIVE POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS, TO MITIGATE FURTHER EXACERBATION OF EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS THAT COVID-19 AND LOCKDOWNS HAVE HAD ON THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES OF ADOLESCENT GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN (AGYW) AGED 15-24, IN SIX DISTRICTS OF SOUTH AFRICA CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH RATES OF HIV, TEENAGE PREGNANCY AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. FOLLOWING A CONCURRENT TRIANGULATION MIXED-METHODS APPROACH, WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WITH 515 AGYW, AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH 50 AGYW. MORE THAN HALF OF SURVEY PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED IN EDUCATION HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR STUDIES. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH EDUCATIONAL DISRUPTION INCLUDED LOW SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, LACK OF CELL PHONE ACCESS AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD INSECURITY. QUALITATIVE NARRATIVES INCLUDED CHALLENGES WITH ONLINE LEARNING AND STUDYING AT HOME IN RESOURCE RESTRICTED SETTINGS, AND INSUFFICIENT SUPPORT FROM SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS. HOWEVER, DESPITE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO CONTINUING EDUCATION, SOME AGYW DEMONSTRATED EDUCATIONAL RESILIENCE, ENABLED BY PSYCHOSOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORT, AND RESOURCE ACCESS. OUR FINDINGS LEND SUPPORT TO AN EMERGING EVIDENCE BASE SHOWING THAT THE CLOSURE OF SCHOOLS AND TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS, COMBINED WITH CHALLENGING HOME ENVIRONMENTS, AND A LACK OF ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY, HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED THE MOST VULNERABLE AGYW, EXACERBATING PRE-EXISTING EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITIES WITHIN THE SOUTH AFRICAN EDUCATION SYSTEM. ADDRESSING STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO EDUCATIONAL EQUITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE PANDEMIC CONTEXT, INCLUDING ACCESS OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE INTERNET, IS URGENT.","SOUTH AFRICAN MED RES COUNCIL, HLTH SYST RES UNIT, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.;  UNIV CAPE TOWN, DIV SOCIAL & BEHAV SCI, SCH PUBL HLTH & FAMILY MED, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.;  UNIV SHEFFIELD, SHEFFIELD INST INT DEV SIID, SHEFFIELD, S YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND.;  SOUTH AFRICAN MED RES COUNCIL, BIOSTAT RES UNIT, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.","DUBY, Z (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), SOUTH AFRICAN MED RES COUNCIL, HLTH SYST RES UNIT, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.; DUBY, Z (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV CAPE TOWN, DIV SOCIAL & BEHAV SCI, SCH PUBL HLTH & FAMILY MED, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.","ADNAN M, 2020, DOI 10.33902/jpsp.2020261309; CHAUKE T, 2020; CLOETE A, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.ssaho.2021.100167; CRESWELL J, 2006; CROMPTON H, 2021; CZERNIEWICZ L, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s42438-020-00187-4.; DONNER J, 2011; FAVARA M, 2021; GITTINGS L, 2021, DOI 10.1080/17441692.2021.1899262; GUSTAFSSON M, 2020; HALL K, 2018; HANNAN S, 2021; HARTNACK A, 2017; HOADLEY U, 2020; HUANG Z, 1997; KEEVY J, 2021; KOLA L, 2021, DOI 10.1016/s2215-0366(21)00025-0; LAHER S, 2021, DOI 10.1177/0081246321995095; LANDA N, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11159-021-09903-z; LE GRANGE L, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11125-020-09514-w; LYNNEBAKKE B, 2020, DOI 10.1080/17482631.2020.1785694; MAJANJA M, 2020, DOI 10.1108/lm-05-2020-0084; MARQUES S, 2021, DOI 10.1093/cs/cdab006; MHLANGA D, 2020, DOI 10.3390/educsci10070180; MOTALA S, 2020; MURDIANTO M, 2020; NEL C, 2020; NGOGI EMMANUEL M, 2020; NWOSU C, 2021, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0255183; OLUKA A, 2021; RAFAELI T, 2020; REDDY V, 2020; RUNHARE T, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11159-021-09910-0; SHEPHERD D, 2021; SHUNG-KING M, 2021; SOUTH AFRICAN CHILD G, 2018; SPAULL N, 2021; SPAULL N, 2015; SPAULL N, 2020, DOI 10.4102/sajce.v10i1.924; STATSSA, 2019; TIMM W, 2021; TOMLINSON M, 2021; UNESCO, 2021; UNESCO (UN EDUC SCI CULT O, 2021; VAN DER BERG S, 2020; VAN GEEL J, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1103308820940184; WAXMAN H, 2003; WERNLI D, 2021, DOI 10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006794; WEYBRIGHT E, 2017, DOI 10.15700/saje.v37n2a1353; WILS A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2019.03.024",1,2022,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000778494500001,ISI,SOUTH AFRICAN MED RES COUNCIL;UNIV CAPE TOWN;UNIV SHEFFIELD;SOUTH AFRICAN MED RES COUNCIL,SOUTH AFRICAN MED RES COUNCIL;UNIV CAPE TOWN,NA,"DUBY Z, 2022, FRONT EDUC","DUBY Z, 2022, FRONT EDUC",UNITED KINGDOM;SOUTH AFRICA;SOUTH AFRICA;SOUTH AFRICA,10.3389/feduc.2022.856610,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,NA,WOS

UTILIZING REMOTE SENSING AND DEMAND FORECASTING, LEAST-COST NETWORK DESIGNS ARE DEVELOPED FOR EIGHT REPRESENTATIVE LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (MALAWI, UGANDA, KENYA, SENEGAL, PAKISTAN, ALBANIA, PERU AND MEXICO), THE RESULTS FROM WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR GLOBAL AGGREGATION VIA A NEW ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK. THE COST OF MEETING A MINIMUM SIMILAR TO 10 MBPS PER USER IS ESTIMATED AT USD 2 TRILLION USING 5G NON-STANDALONE, APPROXIMATELY 0.67% OF ANNUAL GDP FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD OVER THE NEXT DECADE. HOWEVER, BY CREATING A FAVORABLE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, GOVERNMENTS CAN BRING DOWN THESE COSTS BY ALMOST HALF - TO USD 1.2 TRILLION (APPROXIMATELY 0.41% OF ANNUAL GDP) - AND AVOID THE NEED FOR PUBLIC SUBSIDY. PROVIDING GOVERNMENTS MAKE JUDICIOUS CHOICES, ADOPTING FISCAL AND REGULATORY REGIMES CONDUCIVE TO LOWERING COSTS, UNIVERSAL BROADBAND MAY BE WITHIN REACH OF MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES OVER THE NEXT DECADE.","GEORGE MASON UNIV, COLL SCI, FAIRFAX, VA USA.;

TODAY'S STUDENT POPULATION IS MADE UP OF ""DIGITAL NATIVES"" WHO HAVE GROWN UP UNDER THE UBIQUITOUS INFLUENCE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, AND FOR WHOM THE USE OF ICT IS COMMON AND WHOSE DAILY ACTIVITIES ARE STRUCTURED AROUND MEDIA USE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF ICT USE AND DIGITAL SKILLS ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND TO EXPLORE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN FRANCE. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH FACE-TO-FACE QUESTIONNAIRES ADMINISTERED TO 1323 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THREE FRENCH UNIVERSITIES. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS, A NON-HIERARCHICAL K-MEANS CLUSTERING APPROACH AND MULTILEVEL ORDERED LOGISTIC REGRESSION WERE USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS AND PROVIDE FOUR MAIN FINDINGS: FIRST, POOR INVESTMENT IN ICT AFFECTS STUDENTS' RESULTS; SECOND, THE ICT TRAINING OFFERED BY UNIVERSITIES HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON STUDENTS' RESULTS; THIRD, STUDENT PERFORMANCE IMPROVES WITH THE INNOVATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE USE OF ICTS; FOURTH, THE ACQUISITION OF DIGITAL SKILLS INCREASES STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE STILL EXISTS, AND THIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATION POLICIES IN FRANCE. THEY SUGGEST ALSO THAT ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE IN UNIVERSITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE AN EXPLOITATION OF ICT.","UNIV COTE DAZUR, GREDEG CNRS, 5 RUE 22EME BCA, F-06300 NICE, FRANCE.;  UNIV GAFSA, HIGHER INST BUSINESS ADM, SIDI AHMED ZARROUG 2112, GAFSA, TUNISIA.","BEN YOUSSEF, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COTE DAZUR, GREDEG CNRS, 5 RUE 22EME BCA, F-06300 NICE, FRANCE.","AGARWAL R, 1998, DOI 10.2307/1183399; AGASISTI T, 2021, DOI 10.1080/03075079.2020.1859689; ALHABEEB A, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.08.007; ATTEWELL P, 1999; BALL S, 2006, DOI 10.1257/000282806777212215; BANERJEE A, 2007, DOI 10.1162/qjec.122.3.1235; BEN Y, 2009; BEN YOUSSEF A, 2008, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v5i1.327; BEN YOUSSEF A, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10639-013-9272-x; BROWN B, 2002, DOI 10.1257/000282802320191778; BUASUWAN P, 2018, DOI 10.1108/aeds-07-2017-0072; CALAFIORE P, 2011, DOI 10.1080/00220485.2011.581934; CAO X, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.023; CASTILLO-MERINO D, 2009, DOI 10.3917/res.155.0055; CASTILLO-MERINO D, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.06.020; CELEUX G, 1989; CHEN J, 2016; DAHMANI M, 2008, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v5i1.326; DAHMANI M, 2021, DOI 10.9734/sajsse/2021/v12i330305; DAHMANI M, 2009, DOI 10.3917/res.155.0081; DEMIRCI N, 2010; DU J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.acalib.2011.04.003; DYSON B, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10734-014-9776-3; ERDOGDU F, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.10.023; FAIRLIE R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.econedurev.2018.01.004; FAIRLIE R, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2012.06.001; FERNANDEZ-FERRER M, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s41239-016-0021-2; FLAVIN M, 2016, DOI 10.1093/oxrep/grw028; FRATTO V, 2016, DOI 10.4018/ijicte.2016070107; FUCHS T, 2004; GIL-FLORES J, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.11.057; GIUNCHIGLIA F, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.041; GREENE J, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.03.008; GREENE W, 2018; GUI M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389751; HAIR J, 2006; HAMALAINEN R, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.10.013; HAN H, 2019, DOI 10.2224/sbp.7961; HAN J, 2012; HARMON O, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.iree.2019.100157; HENDERSON M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/03075079.2015.1007946; HINRICHSEN J, 2013, DOI 10.3402/rlt.v21.21334; JULIEN H, 2018, DOI 10.5860/crl.79.2.179; KRASILNIKOV A, 2014; KUO Y, 2017; LEE S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.11.016; LNENICKA M, 2022, DOI 10.1108/ajim-08-2021-0249; LNENICKA M, 2021, DOI 10.1108/oir-05-2020-0204; LUNDIN J, 2003, DOI 10.1046/j.0266-4909.2003.00029.x; MAGALHAES P, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103869; MCGREW S, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00933104.2017.1416320; MENGUAL-ANDRES S, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s41239-016-0009-y; MONDAL S, 2017; NIKIFOROVA A, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2021.101622; NUNNALLY J C, 1978; PEZZINO M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.iree.2018.03.002; POWER E, 2020, DOI 10.1080/07294360.2019.1676703; RAMIREZ G, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.10.004; RODRIGUEZ-ABITIA G, 2021, DOI 10.3390/fi13020052; RUBACH C, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2020.106636; SAMAHA M, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.045; SHARPE A, 2004; SOSIN K, 2004, DOI 10.1257/0002828041301623; TABACHNICK B G, 2007; TADESSE T, 2018, DOI 10.14742/ajet.2957; VAN DEURSEN A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2014.09.003; VAN LAAR E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010; VAUGHAN N, 2017, DOI 10.1111/bjet.12537; VEGA-HERNANDEZ M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2018.03.004; VIGDOR J, 2014, DOI 10.1111/ecin.12089; WOOLDRIDGE J, 2010; WURST C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2008.05.006; WUTHISATIAN R, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.iree.2018.11.001; YOUSSEF A, 2009, DOI https://",5,2022,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000775014200001,ISI,UNIV COTE DAZUR;UNIV GAFSA,UNIV COTE DAZUR,NA,"BEN YOUSSEF A, 2022, INFORMATION","BEN YOUSSEF A, 2022, INFORMATION",FRANCE;TUNISIA,10.3390/info13030129,NA,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS",5,MDPI,NA,WOS

AT THE SAME TIME, UTILIZATION OF NEW EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING, BIG DATA ANALYTICS, OPEN DATA, SOCIAL MEDIA, OR INTERNET OF THINGS HAS BECOME MORE COMMONPLACE IN RECENT YEARS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DETERMINES ICT DISPARITIES AND DIGITAL DIVIDES IN THE CONTEXT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND DIGITAL WORLD SHIFTS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF ICT-RELATED INDICATORS ELUCIDATING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TRADITIONAL AND NEW APPROACH IS PROPOSED. THESE ICT INDICATORS WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE DECOMPOSITION OF RELATED ICT AND E-GOVERNMENT INDICES TOGETHER WITH EXPLANATORY FACTORS DERIVED FROM THE LITERATURE. THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES WERE CHOSEN AS A SAMPLE FOR THE EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF RELEVANT INDICATORS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, CORRELATION, FACTOR, REGRESSION, AND CLUSTER ANALYSES WERE EMPLOYED AS EMPIRICAL STRATEGIES TO CARRY OUT THIS STUDY. THE HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX TOGETHER WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPLANATORY FACTORS FOR THE NEW APPROACH, WHILE THE TRADITIONAL SET OF INDICATORS IS STILL MOSTLY CORRELATED WITH THE GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER CAPITA. FINALLY, FIVE CLUSTERS OF MEMBER STATES WERE IDENTIFIED AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE USE OF ICT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR ARE DESCRIBED.","UNIV PARDUBICE, FAC ECON & ADM, SCI & RES CTR, STUDENTSKA 84, PARDUBICE 53210, CZECH REPUBLIC.;  UNIV PARDUBICE, FAC ECON & ADM, INST SYST ENGN & INFORMAT, STUDENTSKA 84, PARDUBICE 53210, CZECH REPUBLIC.","LNENIEKA, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV PARDUBICE, FAC ECON & ADM, SCI & RES CTR, STUDENTSKA 84, PARDUBICE 53210, CZECH REPUBLIC.","ABDEL-FATTAH MANAL A, 2014; AL-MUTAWKKIL A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2008.12.008; ARCHIBUGI D, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2004.12.002; AYANSO A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2011.02.004; BANNISTER F, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0020852307077959; BARRENECHEA M J, 2014; BARTLETT M, 1950, DOI 10.1111/j.2044-8317.1950.tb00285.x; BILLON M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.08.006; BOGDANOSKA JOVANOVSKA M, 2016; CHANG Y, 2015, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2015100103; COHEN J, 2003; COSTELLO A, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781412995627.d8; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2018, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2018040101; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10796-016-9634-1; CRUZ-JESUS F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2012.09.003; DODEL M, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3209415.3209475; DOONG S, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2012.02.002; DUTTA S, 2020; ELENA-BUCEA A, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10796-020-10012-9; EUROPEAN C, 2015; HANAFIZADEH M, 2013, DOI 10.4018/ijea.2013070103; HELBIG N, 2009; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001; JANSSEN M, 2010, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-14799-9_14; KAISER H, 1970, DOI 10.1007/bf02291817; KASSEN M, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0266666912473620; LACHANA Z, 2018; LAKKA S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.06.024; LIM J, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-38862-0_26; LINDERS D, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2012.06.003; LNENICKA M, 2015; LNENICKA M, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2021.101605; LNENICKA M, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.11.004; LNENICKA M, 2015; MACHOVA R, 2016, DOI 10.29379/jedem.v8i1.412; MACHOVA R, 2018; MACHOVA R, 2015, DOI 10.1515/revecp-2015-0027; MISHRA D, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.03.030; MOHAMMED F, 2013; NAM T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.09.006; NARDO M, 2008, DOI 10.1787/533411815016; OJO A, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-22878-0_2; OXFORD I, 2020; RORISSA A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.09.006; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; SISKOS E, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.omega.2014.02.001; STOLTZFUS K, 2005; UNITED N, 2018; UNITED N, 2020; VENTURA E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2015.07.002; CUERVO M, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2006.05.001; WASEDA U, 2020; WIMMER M, 2020; WORLD ECONOMIC F, 2016; YERA A, 2020, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0231585; ZAHRAN DALAL I, 2015; ZHANG H, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.10.013; ZHAO F, 2014, DOI 10.1108/itp-01-2013-0022; ZISSIS D, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.010",0,2022,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000770695400002,ISI,UNIV PARDUBICE;UNIV PARDUBICE,UNIV PARDUBICE,NA,"LNENIEKA M, 2022, REV ECON PERSPECT","LNENIEKA M, 2022, REV ECON PERSPECT",CZECH REPUBLIC;CZECH REPUBLIC,10.2478/revecp-2022-0002,NA,ECONOMICS,0,SCIENDO,NA,WOS

PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON INTERNET USE AMONG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAS COMPARED THE INTERNET ACCESS AND USE OF PEOPLE WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES, HAS INVESTIGATED GENERAL BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNET USE FOR PEOPLE WITH ID, OR HAS EXAMINED HOW THEIR INTERNET SKILLS AND USE CAN BE IMPROVED. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE WHETHER DIFFERENCES CAN BE FOUND IN VARYING ASPECTS OF INTERNET ACCESS, USE PURPOSES, SKILLS AND USE SUPPORT AMONG A GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH ID. FACE-TO-FACE SURVEY DATA WERE COLLECTED AMONG 94 PEOPLE WITH ID (57.4% MEN; M-AGE = 45.28, SDAGE = 12.20). OUR STUDY REVEALED THAT PARTICULARLY YOUNGER PEOPLE WITH ID HAVE MORE ACCESS, USE THE INTERNET FOR MORE DIFFERENT PURPOSES, HAVE MORE SKILLS AND REPORT TO BE MORE SUPPORTED WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER PROBLEMS COMPARED TO OLDER PEOPLE WITH ID. WE FURTHER FOUND THAT EMPLOYED PERSONS WITH ID HAVE HIGHER SKILLS THAN UNEMPLOYED ONES, AND THAT PEOPLE WHO RELY LESS ON PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS HAVE MORE SKILLS THAN THOSE WHO RELY MORE ON PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS. GIVEN THESE RESULTS, WE SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE WITH ID SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A HETEROGENEOUS GROUP OF INTERNET USERS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE RECOMMEND ORGANIZATIONS AND CAREGIVERS TO DIFFERENTIATE WHEN TEACHING OR APPLYING INTERNET USE AMONG THIS POPULATION.","UNIV GHENT, DEPT COMMUN SCI, IMEC, MICT, GHENT, BELGIUM.;  UC LEUVEN LIMBURG, INCLUS SOC, DIEPENBEEK, BELGIUM.;  VRIJE UNIV BRUSSEL, DEPT COMMUN SCI, IMEC, SMIT, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.","ANRIJS, S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV GHENT, DEPT COMMUN SCI, IMEC, MICT, GHENT, BELGIUM.","AGREN K, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819888398; ANRIJS S, 2021, DOI 10.6084/m9.figshare.14207663.v1; ANRIJS S, 2020, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0233891; BIGBY C, 2019, DOI 10.3109/13668250.2017.1378873; GOMEZ D, 2019, DOI 10.1080/13676261.2018.1559283; GOMEZ D, 2021, DOI 10.1177/1461444820933252; CATON S, 2016, DOI 10.3109/13668250.2016.1153052; CHADWICK D, 2017, DOI 10.1111/bld.12170; CHINER E, 2021, DOI 10.1080/1034912x.2019.1696950; CHINER E, 2017, DOI 10.1111/bld.12192; CHO M, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101214; CHO M, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.dhjo.2021.101101; COURTOIS C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814562162; DELGADO P, 2019, DOI 10.1111/jar.12562; GLENCROSS S, 2021, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2020.0499; GRISHCHENKO N, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2020.102004; HARGITTAI E, 2003, DOI 10.1002/anie.200602280; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.957711; HEITPLATZ V, 2022, DOI 10.1177/1744629520971375; HEITPLATZ V, 2020, DOI 10.17645/si.v8i2.2578; HELSPER E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1203454; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; JENARO C, 2018, DOI 10.1111/jar.12388; JOHANSSON S, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10209-020-00714-x; KIM K, 2021, DOI 10.1111/jar.12843; LOFGREN-MARTENSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s11195-015-9415-7; LOUGH E, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jir.12281; MINGO I, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11205-016-1511-2; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; NORMAND C, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jar.12163; OLSSON T, 2018, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1355007; PALMER S, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2011.01489.x; PARK S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.12.018; RAGNEDDA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1461444819869604; RAMSTEN C, 2019, DOI 10.1111/jppi.12278; RICE E, 2014, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12038; SALLAFRANQUE-ST-LOUIS F, 2017, DOI 10.5817/cp2017-1-7; SALMERON L, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s11145-016-9621-4; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHEHL B, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2019.03.031; SENKBEIL M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2017.02.003; SUN K, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2021.101566; TSATSOU P, 2022, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2021.1873402; TSETSI E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/2050157917708329; UNITED N, 2015; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VANDENDRIESSCHE K, 2020",1,2022,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,WOS:000791241200003,ISI,UNIV GHENT;VRIJE UNIV BRUSSEL,UNIV GHENT,NA,"ANRIJS S, 2022, TELEMAT INFORM","ANRIJS S, 2022, TELEMAT INFORM",BELGIUM;BELGIUM;BELGIUM,10.1016/j.tele.2022.101784,NA,INFORMATION SCIENCE & LIBRARY SCIENCE,1,ELSEVIER,GHENT UNIVERSITY (BIJZONDER ONDERZOEKSFONDS) [01D33218],WOS

ACCORDING TO THE AUTHORS, THE DEAL, WHICH HAS COMMITTED ALL 27 MEMBER STATES TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION, INVESTMENT, AND JOBS, CAN SUPPORT THE POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION OF EUROPEAN SOCIETY, EVEN AGAINST A BACKDROP OF ENORMOUS CHALLENGES AND HUGE IMPACTS THAT WE CAN NOW IMAGINE.","UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, BRASOV, ROMANIA.","BRATUCU, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV, BRASOV, ROMANIA.","AISSAOUI N, 2022, DOI 10.1108/gkmc-06-2020-0075; BAUMEISTER R, 1997, DOI 10.1037/1089-2680.1.3.311; BECKER B, 2022, DOI 10.1080/17482798.2021.1902359; BIEZA KATRINA E, 2020, DOI 10.4018/ijseus.2020040101; CHIPEVA P, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.06.003; CHOI E, 2020, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnaa066; COMISIA E, 2020; COMISIA E, 2021; DABIJA D, 2017; DHUNGANA, 2021, DOI 10.13140/rg.2.2.17241.03684; ERTL B, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2020.102259; EUROPEAN C, 2019; EUROPEAN C, 2021; EUROPEAN C, 2021; EUROSTAT, 2021; EUROSTAT, 2021; EUROSTAT, 2021; EUROSTAT, 2021; EUROSTAT, 2019; EUROSTAT, 2021; RODRIGUEZ-HEVIA L, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12176807; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GU J, 2021, DOI 10.3390/su13158590; HILLIER, 2017; HOLGERSSON J, 2019; HUXHOLD O, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s10433-020-00552-z; JOHANSSON S, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10209-020-00714-x; KASHYAP R, 2021, DOI 10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00294-7; KERRAS H, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12083347; LIST A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2019.03.009; MCDONOUGH, 2020, DOI 10.28933/ijoar-2020-02-2305; MOLALA T, 2021, DOI 10.18510/hssr.2021.9427; MUBARAK F, 2020, DOI 10.1108/jices-02-2019-0021; NOLL J, 2018; OPEN LEARNING E, 2021; PAGANI L, 2016, DOI 10.1080/03055698.2016.1148588; PLOTICHKINA N, 2020, DOI 10.20542/0131-2227-2020-64-4-70-83; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424843; REDDY P, 2020, DOI 10.1109/csde50874.2020.9411548; SALA E, 2022, DOI 10.1177/0894439320909507; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; SANDERS C, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s41134-020-00147-9; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SNYDER H, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2019.07.039; SURIAN A, 2019, DOI 10.25304/rlt.v27.2155; TABLEAU P, 2021; TAVARES A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104240; TOMCZYK L, 2019; TRANFIELD D, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1467-8551.00375; TWENGE J, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0265407519836170; UN GENERAL A, 2015; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2010.496338; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN DIJK J, 2020; VASILESCU M, 2020, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0232032; YILDIZ P, 2020, DOI 10.18844/cjes.v%vi%i.4913; ZALAT M, 2021, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0248758",1,2022,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000746992700006,ISI,UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV,UNIV TRANSILVANIA BRASOV,NA,"BRATUCU G, 2022, AMFITEATRU ECON","BRATUCU G, 2022, AMFITEATRU ECON",ROMANIA,10.24818/ea/2022/59/77,NA,BUSINESS; ECONOMICS; MANAGEMENT,1,EDITURA ASE,NA,WOS

COMPARED TO OTHER DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES' FUNCTIONALITIES, SFT GENERATE A MULTITUDE OF DATA THAT ONCE COMBINED CAN BE USED NOT ONLY ON-FARM BUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN. ALTHOUGH RECENT STUDIES HIGHLIGHTED HOW THE LACK OF USERS' RESOURCES AND COMPETENCES MIGHT HINDER THE DIFFUSION OF DIGITAL AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGIES OVERALL, FEW STUDIES SO FAR FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON SFT. MOREOVER, THE EXTANT LITERATURE INTERPRETS THE ADOPTION DECISION MOSTLY AS ""ONE-OFF BINARY"" PROCESS, AND LIMITED ATTENTION IS GIVEN TO INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS OF USERS AND FARMS. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE ADOPTION OF SFT ANALYZING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS COMPLEX NATURE; ON THE ONE HAND, THE ANALYSIS CONSIDERS THE MULTI-STEP NATURE OF THE ADOPTION DECISION PROCESS: FIRST, INTENTION FORMATION AND THEN, ACTUAL ADOPTION DECISION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SFT ADOPTION PROCESS IS INTERPRETED AS BEING DETERMINED BY SEVERAL TYPOLOGIES OF DETERMINANTS BEYOND THE MOST STUDIED ONES, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE ROLE THAT ORGANIZATIONAL CONDITIONS AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PLAY IN INFLUENCING FARMERS' ADOPTION OF SFT. AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS IS RUN ON A SAMPLE OF 474 RESPONSES, COLLECTED THROUGH AN ON-LINE SURVEY. STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM) AND A ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION (ZIP) WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE RESPECTIVELY THE INTENTION TO USE AND THE ACTUAL ADOPTION OF SFT. RESULTS SHOW THAT FARMERS' INTENTION TO USE MAINLY RELIES ON TECHNOLOGIES' PERFORMANCE EXPECTANCY, TECHNOLOGIES' COMPLEXITY AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE EXERTED ON FARMERS, WHILE ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORTING CONDITIONS DO NOT PLAY A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. NONETHELESS, WHEN THE ACTUAL ADOPTION DECISION IS OBSERVED, THE LIKELIHOOD THAT NON-ADOPTERS INTEND TO ADOPT SFT IN THEIR FARMS INCREASES WHEN FORMAL INTEGRATION ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS HIGH AND WITH THE DIMENSION OF THE FARM (IN TERMS OF BOTH LAND SIZE AND SALES). WHEN THE ADOPTERS ARE ANALYZED INSTEAD, THE DECISION TO ADOPT IS POSITIVELY AFFECTED ONLY BY THE INDIVIDUAL INTENTION TO USE AND BY FARMERS' SPECIALIZATION IN THE ARABLE SECTOR. FINDINGS REVEAL WHAT FACTORS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED TO GUARANTEE A FAIRER AND MORE INCLUSIVE AGRICULTURAL DIGITALIZATION, SUCH AS THE ROLE OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE EXERTED BY SOME FIGURES AROUND FARMERS AND THE STILL WEAK FACILITATING ORGANIZATIONAL CONDITIONS.","ALMA MATER STUDIORUM UNIV BOLOGNA, DEPT AGR & FOOD SCI, VIALE FANIN 50, I-40127 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;  WAGENINGEN UNIV & RES, DEPT SOCIAL SCI BUSINESS MANAGEMENT & ORG GRP, HOLLANDSEWEG 1, NL-6707 KN WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS.","GIUA, C (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), ALMA MATER STUDIORUM UNIV BOLOGNA, DEPT AGR & FOOD SCI, VIALE FANIN 50, I-40127 BOLOGNA, ITALY.","ADRIAN A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2005.04.004; AUBERT B, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2012.07.002; AUTIO E, 2017; BARNES A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.10.004; BARNES A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.envsci.2018.12.014; BATTE M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2004.08.002; BEZA E, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2018.06.015; BONANNO A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/agr.21542; BRONSON K, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.njas.2019.03.001; BUSSE M, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s11119-013-9337-2; CAFFARO F, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.04.028; CARRER M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2017.04.004; CHARATSARI C, 2020, DOI 10.3390/ani10112056; CRONBACH L, 1951; DABERKOW S G, 2003, DOI 10.1023/a:1024557205871; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; ENARD C M, 2018; FABREGAS R, 2019, DOI 10.1126/science.aay3038; FARIDI A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104885; FOUNTAS S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2014.11.011; GARDEZI M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11119-019-09681-7; GERE A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.foodqual.2017.02.005; GEREFFI G, 2016; GIAGNOCAVO C, 2017, DOI 10.25165/j.ijabe.20171005.3089; GIUA C, 2021, DOI 10.1108/bfj-05-2020-0420; HAIR J, 2009; ISGIN T, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2008.01.004; KARANTININIS K, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.foodpol.2009.10.003; KATAIKE J, 2019, DOI 10.1108/bfj-12-2018-0808; KERNECKER M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11119-019-09651-z; KLERKX L, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-4503-2; KLERKX L, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.njas.2019.100315; KNIERIM A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.njas.2019.100314; KOLADY D, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11119-020-09750-2; KUTTER T, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11119-009-9150-0; LAWSON L, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2011.03.002; LI W, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2020.105305; LIOUTAS E, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.njas.2019.04.003; MARIA K, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2020.102952; MARTINO G, 2019, DOI 10.1108/bfj-12-2017-0697; MARTINO G, 2017, DOI 10.1108/bfj-12-2016-0585; MICHELS M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11119-020-09715-5; MICHELS M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11119-019-09675-5; OSSERVATORINET, 2021; OSSERVATORIO SMART A, 2019; PATHAK H, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s11119-019-09653-x; PAUSTIAN M, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s11119-016-9482-5; PESCE M, 2019; PIERCE F J, 1994; PIERPAOLI E, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.protcy.2013.11.010; PIVOTO D, 2019, DOI 10.22434/ifamr2018.0086; RAMIREZ A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.05.059; RAYNAUD E, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s10997-005-1571-1; RIJSWIJK K, 2020; ROGERS E, 2003; RONAGHI M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101415; ROTZ S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.01.023; RRN RETE RURALE NAZIONALE R, 2019; SCHUKAT S, 2019, DOI 10.3390/ani9121042; SCHULZE B, 2007, DOI 10.3920/jcns2007.x076; SCUOTTO V, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10961-016-9517-0; SHANG L, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103074; SUNDING D, 2001; TEY Y, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s11119-012-9273-6; TIFFIN R, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8489.2011.00549.x; TILSON D, 2010, DOI 10.1287/isre.1100.0318; TOMA L, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10961-016-9520-5; VAN DER BURG S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.njas.2019.01.001; VECCHIO Y, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104481; VECCHIO Y, 2020, DOI 10.3390/ijerph17030869; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; VENKATESH V, 2012; VERDOUW C, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2015.11.009; WEERSINK A, 2020, DOI 10.1002/aepp.13004; WEVER M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.05.012; WOLFERT S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023; ZENG Y, 2016; ZHANG N, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0168-1699(02)00096-0",3,2022,SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000820489800007,ISI,ALMA MATER STUDIORUM UNIV BOLOGNA;WAGENINGEN UNIV AND RES,ALMA MATER STUDIORUM UNIV BOLOGNA,NA,"GIUA C, 2022, TECHNOL SOC","GIUA C, 2022, TECHNOL SOC",ITALY;NETHERLANDS,10.1016/j.techsoc.2022.101869,NA,"SOCIAL ISSUES; SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,NA,WOS

SOC.,ARTICLE,(ROMA) TEENAGE MOTHERS; COVID-19 LOCKDOWN; TACIT AGENCY; RELATIVE DIGITAL DEPRIVATION; SOCIAL ISOLATION; DIGITAL DIVIDE,EXPERIENCES; EMBODIMENT; INEQUALITY; AGENCY,"THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE INTERLINKS BETWEEN MULTIPLE LAYERS OF EXCLUSION AND DEPRIVATION OF ROMA ADOLESCENTS MOTHERS IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND: A) HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXCLUSION (E.G., DIGITAL, SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL) OVERLAP AND HOW ARE THOSE TYPES OF EXCLUSION LIVED AND PERCEIVED BY TEENAGE MOTHERS; AND B) WHETHER AND HOW THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CHANGED EXISTING INEQUALITIES IN THEIR SITUATION. IN OUR PAPER, WE REFER TO TEENAGE MOTHERS TO DESCRIBE MOTHERS WHO GAVE BIRTH BEFORE THE AGE OF 18. THE STUDY HAS A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATORY APPROACH AND RELIES ON TEN INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH ROMA TEENAGE MOTHERS IN PERIPHERAL URBAN AREAS IN ROMANIA DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC LOCKDOWN IN THE SPRING OF 2020. AS A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, THE STUDY EMPLOYS THE RELATIVE DIGITAL DEPRIVATION THEORY, (HELSPER, 2016) WHICH TOUCHES UPON THREE DIMENSIONS OF DIGITAL DIVIDES WHILE REVEALING DIFFERENT MARKERS OF AGENCY THAT YOUNG MOTHERS MANIFEST. IN OUR UNDERSTANDING, ""AGENCY"" IS NOT LIMITED TO ACTIVE AGENCY, BUT ENCOMPASSES THE ""TACIT OR HIDDEN AGENCY"" AS WELL (SNIEKERS, 2018). MOREOVER, WE RELIED ON MAHESHWARI'S WORK (2019) THAT DEVELOPED THE CONCEPT OF POSITIONING TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS' IDENTITIES ARE SHAPED BY DIFFERENT COMPETING DISCOURSES (E.G. VICTIMHOOD AND AGENCY). ALTHOUGH FROM AN ABSOLUTE-OBJECTIVE PERSPECTIVE THE RESULTS SHOWED THESE YOUNG WOMEN AS BEING DIGITALLY AND SOCIALLY EXCLUDED, FROM THEIR SUBJECTIVE-RELATIVE PERSPECTIVE, WITH THEIR LIVES GRAVITATING AROUND THEIR NEW BABIES AND PARTNERS, THEIR EXCLUSION IS NOT PERCEIVED AS UNFAIR OR ILLOGICAL, BUT IN LINE WITH THE USUAL EXPECTATIONS AND VALUES OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. UNEXPECTEDLY, THE LOCKDOWN PERIOD DID NOT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A DISTURBING EFFECT ON THEIR ALREADY SECLUDED AND HUGELY MARGINALIZED LIVES (ONLINE OR OFFLINE), ALTHOUGH IN SOME CASES SOME CHANGES OCCURRED. BEING ALREADY SOCIALLY EXCLUDED, THEY CONTINUED LIVING IN THEIR MICRO-UNIVERSES OF THEIR HOMES IN REMOTE, ALREADY SEPARATED AREAS, ONLY MARGINALLY CONNECTED TO FEW PARTS OF THE REST OF THE WORLD VIA DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, MANY TIMES RESTRICTED IN THEIR FUNCTIONALITY AND USAGE (I.E., BY POOR DEVICES, POOR CONNECTION, FINANCIALLY POOR FOR DATA SERVICES, POOR SKILLS).

IT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT HAVE EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS (2017-2021) AS WELL AS INVESTIGATE IF THERE ARE NEW FORMS OR LEVELS OF THE DIVIDE THAT HAVE SURFACED IN RECENT LITERATURE. THE FINDINGS, BASED ON 50 INCLUDED STUDIES, SHOW THAT THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS AND NINE MAIN CATEGORIES: SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIOECONOMIC, PERSONAL ELEMENTS, SOCIAL SUPPORT, TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY, DIGITAL TRAINING, RIGHTS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND LARGE-SCALE EVENTS. OUT OF ALL FACTORS, EDUCATION HAS BEEN LINKED TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THE MOST. THE MAJORITY OF RECENT LITERATURE HAVE STUDIED LEVEL 2 OF THE DIVIDE. ALSO, ONLY ONE ARTICLE IN THE SAMPLE HAS CONSIDERED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AT THE FIRM LEVEL. FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT A NEW FORM, TYPE-OF-INTERNET ACCESS, AND TWO POTENTIAL NEW LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ALGORITHMIC AWARENESS AND DATA INEQUALITIES, HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE. THE RESULTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CONCEPT. THEY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE STREAM OF LITERATURE ON THE DETERMINANTS OF THE DIVIDE AND TO THE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES AND DIGITAL INCLUSION LITERATURE. THIS REVIEW CAN BE SEEN AS A GUIDE FOR MANAGERS TO REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE FORMS THAT THE DIVIDE CAN TAKE AND TO DELVE INTO THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES ON THE DIGITALIZATION FRONT AND EVALUATE WHERE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IS NEEDED WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP DIMINISH THE DIVIDE.","UNIV BRISTOL, SCH MANAGEMENT, BRISTOL, AVON, ENGLAND.;

AT THE PRESENT STAGE, WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE WORLD AND INDIVIDUAL STATES IS OBVIOUS AND PROVEN, RESEARCHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON STUDYING ITS FACTORS. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF THE AGE FACTOR ON THE SCALE AND PREVALENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN A THREE-LEVEL MODEL. TO DO THIS, WE CONSIDER THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO STUDYING THE AGE FACTOR OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE; WE ANALYZE TRENDS IN THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES BY REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS AGE GROUPS, AND THE INCLUSION OF CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND THE ELDERLY IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT. THE MODEL OF THREE LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE DEVELOPED BY MODERN SCIENTISTS IS USED AS A THEORETICAL BASIS. ACCORDING TO THE MODEL, INEQUALITY MANIFESTS ITSELF IN ACCESS TO TECHNICAL MEANS, DIFFERENCES IN THE DIGITAL LITERACY, AND THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM DIGITALIZATION. IN THE COURSE OF THE WORK, WE USE A SET OF GENERAL SCIENTIFIC METHODS. WE REVEAL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PRACTICES OF USING PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET AMONG REPRESENTATIVES OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS AND CALCULATE THE TIME PERIODS NECESSARY TO REDUCE INTERGENERATIONAL GAPS IN RUSSIA AND THE VOLOGDA OBLAST. WE ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ONLINE HABITS ON A PERSON'S LIFE, THE PURPOSES OF USING THE INTERNET AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RECEIVING BONUSES FROM IT, THE AVAILABILITY OF DIGITAL SKILLS FOR VARIOUS AGE GROUPS OF VOLOGDA OBLAST POPULATION. THE SCIENTIFIC NOVELTY OF THE STUDY CONSISTS IN ASSESSING THE INFLUENCE OF THE AGE FACTOR ON THE PREVALENCE OF DIGITAL GAP PARAMETERS AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. THE RESULTS CAN BE USED FOR IDENTIFYING THE GROUPS THAT ARE AT RISK OF BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE PROCESSES OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT. THE FINDINGS WILL BE ALSO USEFUL IN FORMULATING THE RELEVANCE OF SOCIAL RETRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THE ABLE-BODIED POPULATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF NEW JOBS, IN TEACHING OLDER PEOPLE DIGITAL SKILLS, AND IN MAKING MANAGERIAL DECISIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT.","RUSSIAN ACAD SCI, VOLOGDA RES CTR, VOLOGDA, RUSSIA.","GRUZDEVA, MA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), RUSSIAN ACAD SCI, VOLOGDA RES CTR, VOLOGDA, RUSSIA.","ANDERSON M, 2017; АРХИПОВА МЮ ARKHIPOVA M Y, 2018; BERNER J, 2012, DOI 10.1080/13607863.2011.602958; BIKKULOV A, 2016; CHARNESS N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01647.x; CHASSIAKOS Y, 2016, DOI 10.1542/peds.2016-2593; DARINSKAYA L, 2017; DMITRIEVA A, 2018, DOI 10.17323/727-0634-2018-16-1-37-50; DOBRINSKAYA D, 2019, DOI 10.22363/2313-2272-2019-19-1-108-120; DONELLE L, 2021, DOI 10.2196/18771; GLADKOVA A, 2019, DOI 10.30547/vestnik.journ.4.2019.4172; GORELOVA T, 2021; GRUZDEVA M, 2020, DOI 10.15838/esc.2020.5.71.5; KHVATOV A, 2017; КУЧМАЕВА О В KUCHMAEVA O V, 2021, DOI 10.34023/2313-6383-2021-28-3-45-55; LELKES O, 2013, DOI 10.1332/175982713x664047; MITZNER T, 2019, DOI 10.1093/geront/gny113; NIEMINEN H, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0267323115614198; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.30547/worldofmedia.4.2018.1; RAGNEDDA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.10.006; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; SAFIULLIN A, 2019, DOI 10.18721/je.12602; SENOKOSOVA O, 2018; SHABUNOVA A, 2019; SHAKIROVA G, 2017; SHAKIROVA G, 2020; ШИНЯЕВА ОВ SHINYAEVA O, 2019; SHINYAEVA O, 2019, DOI 10.18500/1818-9601-2019-19-1-53-61; SMIRNYKH L, 2020, DOI 10.32609/0042-8736-2020-12-104-124; SOLOMATINA V, 2020; VALENTINO L, 2022, DOI 10.18311/ti/2021/v28i1/24809, 10.1097/qad.0000000000003368; VARLAMOVA Y, 2022, DOI 10.17323/1811-038x-2022-31-2-51-74; VOLCHENKO O, 2016, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2016.5.10; YATES S, 2015, DOI 10.5153/sro.3751",0,2022,BUSINESS & ECONOMICS,WOS:000890177700014,ISI,RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,RUSSIAN ACAD SCI,NA,"GRUZDEVA MA, 2022, ECON SOC CHANG","GRUZDEVA MA, 2022, ECON SOC CHANG",RUSSIA,10.15838/esc.2022.4.82.14,NA,ECONOMICS,0,INST SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TERRITORIES RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES-ISEDT RAS,NA,WOS

IN THIS TALK WE WILL PRESENT OUR WORK ON THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ADMINISTRATION'S WEBSITES AND, IN ADDITION, WE WILL DISCUSS THE NEED OF CONSIDERING NON-TECHNOLOGICAL ACCESSIBILITY BARRIERS TO FIND WAYS TO ALLEVIATE THEM.","UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, EUSKAL HERRIKO UNIBERS, LAB HCI SPECIAL NEEDS, DONOSTIA SAN SEBASTIAN, SPAIN.","ABASCAL, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY, EUSKAL HERRIKO UNIBERS, LAB HCI SPECIAL NEEDS, DONOSTIA SAN SEBASTIAN, SPAIN.","ARRUE M, 2019, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2018.1473941; PEREZ J, 2020, DOI 10.1109/access.2020.3001766; PEREZ J, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2899475.2899489; HALL E, 2011, DOI 10.1145/2072069.2072076; MORENO L, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10209-020-00727-6; MORENO L, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.csi.2018.01.003; MORENO X, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3233824.3233845; PEREZ J, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.08.001; PEREZ J E, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2596695.2596715; SALA A, 2020, DOI 10.1145/3371300.3383350; SALA A, 2021, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-85610-6_22; SALAM A, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-23357-0_1; SHIBLAQ K F, 2016; VALENCIA MYRIAM A, 2013, DOI 10.1145/2461121.2461128; VALENCIA X, 2017, DOI 10.1093/iwc/iwx013; VALENCIA X, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-22701-6_1; WORLD B, 2014",0,2022,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000884352600002,ISI,UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY,UNIV BASQUE COUNTRY,NA,"ABASCAL J, 2022, NA","ABASCAL J, 2022, NA",SPAIN,10.1145/3493612.3520443,978-1-4503-9170-2,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS",0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NA,WOS

NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA FROM FINLAND WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2020 AND JANUARY 2021. THE PRESENT STUDY INCLUDED 1524 RESPONDENTS (RESPONSE RATE 68.2%, 56.6% FEMALE) AGED BETWEEN 70 AND 100. THE ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED WITH MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION. ALMOST HALF OF THE RESPONDENTS DID NOT USE DIGITAL SERVICES INDEPENDENTLY. THOSE WHO NEEDED ASSISTANCE DUE TO FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS, HAD INSUFFICIENT ENERGY IN EVERYDAY LIFE, PERCEIVED THAT THEIR MEMORY OR ABILITY TO LEARN WAS IMPAIRED, HAD THREE OR MORE MEMBERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD, AND LIVED IN RURAL REGION HAD GREATER ODDS OF BEING NON-USERS OF DIGITAL SERVICES THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS. THUS, CHALLENGES TO COPE INDEPENDENTLY IN EVERYDAY LIFE, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, AND RURAL LIVING SEEMED TO EXPOSE OLDER ADULTS TO RISK FOR EXCLUSION FROM DIGITAL SERVICES. FACTORS MAY BE INTERCONNECTED, FURTHER WEAKENING THE INCLUSION OF OLDER PEOPLE IN SOCIETY. IT SEEMS THAT ADAPTING TO RAPID DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND FACE-TO-FACE SERVICE DELIVERY CONSTRAINTS DURING THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR THESE VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS. TO ENSURE WIDER USE OF DIGITAL SERVICES, THE NATURAL DECLINE IN FUNCTIONING WITH AGE SHOULD BE NOTED, AND OLDER ADULTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL SERVICES.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED IN MOSCOW AND ST PETERSBURG IS FOCUSED ON DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS INTENSITY CONSIDERED AS AN INDICATOR OF DEVELOPMENT OF POSTINDUSTRIAL SOCIAL STRUCTURES - NETWORKS AND FLOWS. ANALYSIS IS BASED ON THE CRITICAL THEORY OF VIRTUALIZATION OF SOCIETY WHICH IS OPPOSED TO THE DOMINANT DISCOURSE OF DIGITALIZATION. THE DISCOURSE OF DIGITALIZATION REPRESENTS NOT SOCIAL INNOVATIONS BUT RATHER MANAGERIAL AND BUREAUCRATIC APPROPRIATION OF ROUTINE PRACTICES OF VIRTUALIZATION OF SOCIAL PROCESSES. THE RESEARCH REVEALS SUSTAINABILITY AND WIDE SPREAD OF THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS USAGE. HOWEVER, THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH NEW PATTERNS OF SOCIAL LIFE VARIES IN DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY. SOCIAL STRUCTURES REVEALED WITH HELP OF SUCH INDICATORS AS INVOLVEMENT, ACTIVITY AND CREATIVITY IN THE INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS ARE MORE DEVELOPED IN LARGE CITIES AND MEGACITIES WHERE THEY CONSTITUTE A NEW SOCIAL ROUTINE. YOUNG PEOPLE AND THE MIDDLE STRATA PEOPLE ARE LEADING GROUPS IN CONTRIBUTING TO DEVELOPMENT OF NETWORK AND FLOW STRUCTURES. COMMUNICATING ON SOCIAL NETWORKING PLATFORMS AND GENERATING INTENSE FLOWS OF CONTENT, MEMBERS OF THESE SOCIAL GROUPS ACCUMULATE THEIR VIRTUAL CAPITAL.

THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE HEALTH-RELATED INTERNET USE AMONG OLDER PEOPLE IN NORWAY BY USING NATIONAL SURVEY RESULTS OF ICT USAGE IN HOUSEHOLDS. SURVEY RESULTS SHOW THAT GENERAL INTERNET USE AND HEALTH-RELATED INTERNET USE HAVE BEEN INCREASED AMONG OLDER NORWEGIAN POPULATION. THE MOST COMMON PURPOSE FOR HEALTH-RELATED INTERNET USE AMONG OLDER PEOPLE WAS SEEKING HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION AND THE LEAST COMMON PURPOSE WAS OTHER HEALTH SERVICES ONLINE. EVEN THOUGH THE RATE OF INTERNET USE AMONG OLDER PEOPLE IN NORWAY IS HIGHER THAN IN MANY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE EXIST AGE-BASED DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH-RELATED INTERNET USE.","UNIV AGDER, DEPT INFORMAT SYST, UNIV VEIEN 25, KRISTIANSAND, NORWAY.","ACILAR, A (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV AGDER, DEPT INFORMAT SYST, UNIV VEIEN 25, KRISTIANSAND, NORWAY.","ACILAR A, 2021, DOI 10.4018/ijide.2021070102; ALVAREZ-GALVEZ J, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s00038-020-01363-w; BERNER J, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1460458214521226; BLOOM D, 2015, DOI 10.1162/daed_a_00332; BUJNOWSKA-FEDAK M, 2015, DOI 10.1007/5584_2015_130; BUJNOWSKA-FEDAK M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/5584_2019_396; BUJNOWSKA-FEDAK M, 2015, DOI 10.1007/5584_2014_74; CALIXTE R, 2020, DOI 10.3390/ijerph17186856; CHEN W, 2013; CHOI N, 2011, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1753; CHOI N, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2333; CHUNG J, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1748-3743.2010.00238.x; CRABB R, 2012, DOI 10.1159/000329340; CRESCI M, 2012, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2010.515890; ESCOFFERY C, 2018, DOI 10.1089/tmj.2017.0136; FOX G, 2018, DOI 10.1111/isj.12179; GERD P, 2005; GHENAI A, 2020, DOI 10.1145/3343413.3377961; GORDON N, 2018, DOI 10.1186/s12913-018-2986-0; GREGOR P, 2002, DOI 10.1145/638249.638277; HALL A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10810730.2015.1018603; HONE T, 2016, DOI 10.1093/eurpub/ckw022; KANIA-LUNDHOLM M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2015.07.008; KONIG R, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0609-5; KUMMERVOLD P, 2012, DOI 10.1155/2012/297416; LAGACE M, 2016, DOI 10.21018/rjcpr.2016.1.202; LEE E, 2014, DOI 10.2224/sbp.2014.42.9.1563; MARINESCU V, 2017; MCDONOUGH C, 2016, DOI 10.24966/ggm-8662/100008; MCMILLAN S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/10810730802487448; MERKEL S, 2020, DOI 10.2196/15491; MILLER L, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0898264311428167; MORRIS A, 2007, DOI 10.11645/1.3.14; MURPHY M, 2019; NGUYEN A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.04.008; OLPHERT W, 2013, DOI 10.1159/000353630; PAIGE S, 2017, DOI 10.1080/10810730.2016.1250846; ROCKMANN R, 2018; ROCKMANN R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2015.08.376; RONNING W, 2017; SHENG X, 2015, DOI 10.1080/07359683.2015.1000758; SIREN A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/08959420.2016.1187036; TONSAKER T, 2014; WONG C, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0733464812463430; WORLD HEALTH O, 2018; XIE B, 2003, DOI 10.4017/gt.2003.02.04.002.00; ZULMAN D, 2011, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1552",0,2022,COMPUTER SCIENCE; GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY,WOS:000814756600019,ISI,UNIV AGDER,UNIV AGDER,NA,"ACILAR A, 2022, NA","ACILAR A, 2022, NA",NORWAY,10.5220/0010994800003188,978-989-758-566-1,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; GERIATRICS & GERONTOLOGY",0,SCITEPRESS,NA,WOS

FROM THE CENSUS, THE AUTHORS CHOSE THOSE FARMS CONSIDERED MOST REPRESENTATIVE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: THE LEVEL OF CAP (COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY) AND THE PRODUCTION OF MILK (LITRES/COW AND YEAR). THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT A VAST MAJORITY OF THE USERS USE THE WEB TOOLS OF THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, THERE ARE MANY USERS WHO FIND PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE AGILITY AND EASE OF USE OF THESE TOOLS, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH PRIVATE APPS WHICH THEY ALSO USE DAILY IN CONNECTION TO THEIR FARMS.

SCHULTE K,'REAL-TIME' AIR QUALITY CHANNELS: A TECHNOLOGY REVIEW OF EMERGING ENVIRONMENTAL ALERT SYSTEMS,BIG DATA & SOCIETY,BIG DATA SOC.,REVIEW,AIR POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL DATA; DIGITAL TRACES; KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION; PLATFORMS; DIGITAL INEQUALITY,DIGITAL DIVIDE; POLLUTION EXPOSURE; BIG DATA; HEALTH; PARTICIPATION; COMMUNICATION; INEQUALITIES; MOBILE,"POOR AIR QUALITY IS A PRESSING GLOBAL CHALLENGE CONTRIBUTING TO ADVERSE HEALTH IMPACTS AROUND THE WORLD. IN THE PAST DECADE, THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID PROLIFERATION OF AIR QUALITY INFORMATION DELIVERED VIA SENSORS, APPS, WEBSITES OR OTHER MEDIA CHANNELS IN NEAR REAL-TIME AND AT INCREASINGLY LOCALIZED GEOGRAPHIC SCALES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE GROWING EMPHASIS ON SELF-MONITORING AND DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO SUPPLY INFORMATIONAL INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING POLLUTION EXPOSURES AND IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. IT PRESENTS A TECHNOLOGICAL CASE STUDY THAT CHARACTERIZES EMERGING AIR QUALITY INFORMATION COMMUNICATION MECHANISMS, OR 'AQ CHANNELS', WHILE DRAWING UPON EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT THE LITERATURE. THE QUESTIONS ARE POSED: WHICH AIR QUALITY CHANNELS ARE 'FREELY' AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS IN LONDON, UK, AND WHEN AND WHERE ARE THEY ACCESSED? DIGITAL TRACE DATA AND METADATA ASSOCIATED WITH 54 AIR QUALITY CHANNELS ARE SYNTHESIZED NARRATIVELY AND GRAPHICALLY. RESULTS REVEAL AIR QUALITY CHANNELS DERIVE AIR POLLUTION ESTIMATES USING COMMON DATA SOURCES, DISPLAY DISPARATE MESSAGING, ADOPT VARIABLE GEOGRAPHIC SCALES FOR REPORTING 'READINGS' AND MAINTAIN PSYCHOSOCIAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS AND ADOPTION OF EXPOSURE-REDUCING BEHAVIOURS. THE RESULTS ALSO POINT TO A CLEAR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PUBLICATION OF A HIGH-PROFILE NEWS ARTICLE ABOUT AIR POLLUTION AND INCREASED AIR QUALITY CHANNEL ACCESS. THESE FINDINGS ILLUMINATE A NEED FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AROUND HOW AIR QUALITY CHANNELS GENERATE PERSONALIZED AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE ESTIMATES AND TAILOR MESSAGING. THE PAPER CONCLUDES BY CALLING FOR AIR QUALITY CHANNEL DEVELOPERS TO EXERCISE CO-CREATIVE METHODS THAT CAN SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE, DEMOCRATIC DATA AND KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AROUND AIR QUALITY, WHILE CRITICALLY APPROACHING DISPROPORTIONATE PATTERNS OF BOTH POLLUTION AND INFORMATION EXPOSURE.","UNIV OXFORD, DEPT SOCIOL, LEVERHULME CTR DEMOG SCI, OXFORD OX1 1JD, ENGLAND.","SCHULTE, K (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OXFORD, DEPT SOCIOL, LEVERHULME CTR DEMOG SCI, OXFORD OX1 1JD, ENGLAND.","AETHER, 2017; ALBUREZ-GUTIERREZ D, 2019; AMOORE L, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0263276411417430; BARRY A, 2002, DOI 10.1080/03085140220123162; BICKERSTAFF K, 2001, DOI 10.1068/a33173; BOL N, 2018, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2018.1438550; BOWKER G, 2005; BREEZOMETER, 2021; BRISCOE S, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s13104-015-1079-y; BRODY S, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0013916506298800; BROWNING K, 1989, DOI 10.1029/rg027i003p00345; COMEAP, 2010; CRESPIN R, 2016; CRUZ T, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2053951720928097; D'ANTONI D, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2019.01.002; D'ANTONI D, 2017, DOI 10.1186/s12940-017-0307-4; DELMAS M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s10551-019-04215-7; DI BELLA E, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11205-016-1495-y; DIMAGGIO P, 2001; ELLIOTT S, 1999, DOI 10.1023/a:1007029518897; ELO S, 2014, DOI 10.1177/2158244014522633; FECHT D, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.envpol.2014.12.014; FIORE-GARTLAND B, 2015; GABRYS J, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2053951720904871; GABRYS J, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2053951716673391; GARNETT E, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2053951716658061; GLOBAL ACTION P, 2021; GOULD R, 1995; GRAHAM S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/13604813.2015.1014710; HANO M, 2020, DOI 10.3389/fpubh.2020.00143; HARAWAY D, 1988, DOI 10.2307/3178066; HARGITTAI E, 2011; HART P, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0093650211416646; JASANOFF, 2006, DOI 10.4324/9780203413845; JOHNSTON F, 2018, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/aab1e6; KELLY F, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02065.x; KIM J, 2021, DOI 10.1080/24694452.2020.1756208; KITCHIN R, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10708-013-9516-8; KOMAN P, 2018, DOI 10.1002/wmh3.257; LAVE R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2014.988099; LEZAUN J, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0963662507079371; MARRES N, 2017; MORAWSKA L, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2018.04.018; MOSER S, 2007, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511535871.035; MOSLEY S, 2009, DOI 10.3197/096734009x12474738131074; NEFF G, 2017, DOI 10.1089/big.2016.0050; NEFF G, 2016; NEIDELL M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.envsci.2009.12.006; OED O, 2021; OFFICE FOR NATIONAL S, 2016; PRITCHARD H, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818777473; PULIC HEALTH E, 2018; RAPPOLD A, 2019, DOI 10.1029/2019gh000199; RAPPOLD A, 2014, DOI 10.1021/es5012725; RIVAS B, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2017.01.019; ROGERS E, 1995; RUGGIERI M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.09.019; RUPPERT E, 2015; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SHAW A, 2018, DOI 10.1093/joc/jqx003; SIMPSON D, 2012, DOI 10.5194/acp-12-7825-2012; SNYDER E, 2013, DOI 10.1021/es4022602; SUN C, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.06.030; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240390227895; WHATMORE S, 2006, DOI 10.1191/1474474006cgj377oa; WOODALL G, 2017, DOI 10.3390/atmos8100182; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (, 2021",0,2022,SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS,WOS:000813057800001,ISI,UNIV OXFORD,UNIV OXFORD,NA,"SCHULTE K, 2022, BIG DATA SOC","SCHULTE K, 2022, BIG DATA SOC",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1177/20539517221101346,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,LEVERHULME TRUST,WOS

HOWEVER, THIS PARTICIPATION CAN SOMETIMES BE DIMINISHED DUE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THIS PARTICIPATION IS GIVEN, ESPECIALLY IN THE DIGITAL CONTEXTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PREVAILING IN IBERO-AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ANALYZE THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS FOR DIGITAL INCLUSION AND STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN IBERO-AMERICAN UNIVERSITY CONTEXTS. FOR THIS, A QUALITATIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF IBERO-AMERICAN STUDIES ON THEMATIC PATHS IS CARRIED OUT. THE DIALNET DATABASE WAS USED AND, AFTER APPLYING THE DEFINED INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, 32 DOCUMENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW FOR DATA EXTRACTION AND IN DEPTH ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS, FACILITATORS, ACTION PROPOSALS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES THAT ARISE IN THE LITERATURE. IBERO-AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES FACE THE CHALLENGE OF DESIGNING MECHANISMS THAT ALLOW INCLUSIVE DIGITAL PARTICIPATION OF ALL GROUPS IN SOCIETY THAT ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR THIS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO OFFER ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL DIGITAL TOOLS, ANCHOR DIGITAL LITERACY MECHANISMS FOR ALL STUDENTS AND TEACHERS; AND FAVOR THE INVESTIGATION OF STRATEGIES THAT FAVOR SAID PARTICIPATION. ALL THIS WILL OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUNG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FAVORING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CIVIC AND SOCIAL SKILLS.","UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.","CRESPO, MN (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.","AINSCOW M, 2013; ALDERETE M V, 2017, DOI 10.4438/1988-592x-re-2017-377-353; ALMEIDA L, 2012, DOI 10.6018/analesps.28.3.156231; ALTAMIRANO P, 2013; ARANA M, 2005; ARAUJO S, 2012; ARNAIZ P, 2011, DOI 10.15304/ie.21.22; AVALOS DAVILA C, 2018; BARRIO J L, 2008; BARRIO J, 2010; BASSO-POLETTO D, 2020, DOI 10.15359/ree.24-1.16; BERRIO-ZAPATA C, 2014, DOI 10.3916/c43-2014-13; BOOI M, 2017, DOI 10.1080/07294360.2017.1289155; BURKE P, 2013, DOI 10.1080/09620214.2013.790660; BURNS T, 2020; CALDUCH I, 2020, DOI 10.35362/rie8313839; CANELLAS CABRERA A M, 2006; CARCAR BENITO J E, 2014; CARRASCO AZZINI G, 2010; CARRASCO TEMINO M A, 2019, DOI 10.3280/cad2019-001008; CARVAJAL J L, 2018; DELBURY P, 2020, DOI 10.15359/ree.24-1.22; DONOSO S, 2007; ECHEITA G, 2002; ECHEITA G, 2011; ECHEITA G, 2008; ECHEITA G, 2013; SARRIONANDIA G, 2017, DOI 10.17811/rifie.46.2017.17-24; ECHEVERRIA GARCIA S, 2020; FANELLI A, 2020, DOI 10.14482/esal.8.378.82; FERRADA-BUSTAMANTE V, 2021, DOI 10.5354/2452-5014.2021; FERRO SOTO C, 2009, DOI 10.21556/edutec.2009.29.451; GAUCHE MARCHETTI X, 2016, DOI 10.7770/rchdcp-v1n2-art1086; GOMEZ VALDEZ M DEL R, 2020; HERNANDEZ CAICEDO M F, 2016; HIPOLITO RUIZ N, 2020; INSUASTY RODRIGUEZ A, 2010, DOI 10.21500/16578031.379; OLMEDA G, 2011; KERR A, 2017, DOI 10.1111/saje.12174; LAREZ-MATA E, 2010; LLOYD M, 2020; LOPEZ A T, 2005; LOPEZ M, 2011; LUGO MUNOZ M, 2020; MACIAS REYES R, 2020; DIAZ V, 2020, DOI 10.35699/1983-3652.2020.25117; MARTINEZ NICOLAS M, 2011; MEIER K, 2012; MIRALLES GUASCH C, 2010; MOLINA ORJUELA D E, 2014, DOI 10.18667/cienciaypoderaereo.146; MONARCA H, 2011; NACIONES U, 2020; O'SHEA S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/07294360.2015.1087388; OWEN D, 2009; PAREDES E, 2010; PASTRAN CHIRINOS M, 2020, DOI 10.36260/rbr.v9i8.1048; PENA M E, 2017, DOI 10.17345/ute.2017.1.1782; PEREA ALBARRACIN A, 2015; PRADO FUENTES SANDRA E, 2011; SALADO RODRIGUEZ L, 2016; SERVETTO A M, 2012; SILVIO J, 2000; SOLER MASO P, 2011; SOLER MASO P, 2012, DOI 10.14516/fde.2016.014.020.009; SOTELINO LOSADA A, 2019, DOI 10.6018/educatio.363391; SOUZA N, 2020; TAHAN R, 2016, DOI 10.3916/c43-2014-03; TATI MARIÑO S, 2020; PADILLA-CARMONA M, 2016, DOI 10.5209/rev_rced.2016.v27.n3.47669; TORRES GASTELÚ CARLOS A, 2018, DOI 10.15517/aie.v18i2.33131; TUR G, 2017, DOI 10.3916/c51-2017-02; UNESCO, 2017; MATAS J, 2020, DOI 10.14516/fde.737; VILLAGRÁN VALENZUELA L, 2019, DOI 10.32735/s0718-6568/2019-n53-1386; YARZA A, 2014; ZAPPALA, 2011; ZUNIGA M E G, 2018",0,2022,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000810525700002,ISI,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID,NA,"CRESPO MN, 2022, FORO EDUC","CRESPO MN, 2022, FORO EDUC",SPAIN,10.14516/fde.957,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,FAHRENHOUSE,NA,WOS

COMPLUT. EDUC.,ARTICLE,TEACHING; LEARNING; TEACHERS; FAMILIES; DIGITAL GAP,NA,"INTRODUCTION. THE POPULATION CONFINEMENT CAUSED BY CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC FORCED TEACHERS AND FAMILIES TO MAKE AN ALMOST INSTANT TRANSITION FROM TRADITIONAL TEACHING TO ON-LINE TEACHING. BUT HOW DID IT WORK REGARDING THE DIGITAL GAP? THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE SCHOOLS' LOCKDOWN ON THE THREE EXISTING DIGITAL GAPS, ACCESS, COGNITIVE AND SCHOOL, FROM THE TEACHERS AND THE FAMILIES' PERSPECTIVES. METHOD. 9567 SPANISH CITIZENS, 3700 TEACHERS AND 5867 PARENTS, AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. THE STUDY FOLLOWED AN EX POST FACTO RESEARCH DESIGN WITHIN A QUESTIONNAIRE QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGY. A ""SNOWBALL"" NON-PROBABILISTIC SAMPLING WAS USED TO RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS. DATA COLLECTION WAS PERFORMED VIRTUALLY FROM APRIL 15TH TO MAY 8TH, 2020. RESULTS. THEY UNCOVERED AN ""ACCESS GAP"" THAT TEACHERS BLAME ON A DEFICIENT INTERNET CONNECTION AND NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES AT HOME, BUT FAMILIES DO NOT SHARE IT AND POINT TO TELECOMMUTING AS THE MAIN LIMITATION. DISCUSSION. THERE IS A CLEAR ""COGNITIVE GAP"" ACKNOWLEDGED BY TEACHERS AND FAMILIES AND A ""SCHOOL GAP"" THAT TEACHERS BLAME ON INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SCHOOLS, AND AN INSUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE ON ON-LINE EDUCATION. IN CONCLUSION, THE CONFINEMENT CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT A ""DIGITAL GAP"" THAT MANY BELIEVE OVERCAME OR AT LEAST MINIMIZED. HOWEVER, THE COGNITIVE AND THE SCHOOL GAPS NEED ACTIONS.","UNIV OVIEDO, OVIEDO, SPAIN.;  UNIV LEON, LEON, SPAIN.;  UNIV BURGOS, BURGOS, SPAIN.;  UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, MADRID, SPAIN.","FERNANDEZ-RIO, J (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV OVIEDO, OVIEDO, SPAIN.","ALVA DE LA SELVA ALMA R, 2015; ATREVIA, 2017; BALTAR F, 2012, DOI 10.1108/10662241211199960; BERNAL-MENESES L, 2019, DOI 10.1590/interface.180149; CABERO J, 2004, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781107415324.004; CABERO-ALMENARA J, 2018; CLARO M, 2011; COTEC, 2020; COTEC, 2020; DE PABLOS J, 1997; ELSTAD E, 2017, DOI 10.3390/educsci7010027; ENGEN B, 2019, DOI 10.3916/c61-2019-01; CRUZ F, 2018, DOI 10.5944/educxx1.17907; FERNANDEZ DEL MORAL J F, 2012; FERNANDEZ-ENGUITA M, 2020; FRYER W, 2006; GONZALEZ-FERNANDEZ N, 2018, DOI 10.5944/educxx1.16384; GRANADO M, 2019, DOI 10.25267/rev_estud_socioeducativos.2019.i7.02; HOFFMAN D, 2001; JURICA J, 2016; KOSINSKI M, 2015, DOI 10.1037/a0039210; MCMILLAN J H, 2001; MILRAD M, 2013; MONTERO I, 2007; PETTERSSON F, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10639-017-9649-3; SAVE THE C, 2020; TARANGO J, 2009; ZURITA A A, 2021",3,2022,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000784138300016,ISI,UNIV OVIEDO;UNIV LEON;UNIV BURGOS;UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID,UNIV OVIEDO,NA,"FERNANDEZ-RIO J, 2022, REV COMPLUT EDUC","FERNANDEZ-RIO J, 2022, REV COMPLUT EDUC",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.5209/rced.74389,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,3,"UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",NA,WOS

TO IDENTIFY THE DIGITAL DIVIDES OF ACCESS AND IMPACT OF ICT ON DISABLED USERS, AN EXPLORATORY QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. RELYING ON A FRENCH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR DISABILITY THAT GRANTS UNIQUE ACCESS TO DISABLED ICT USERS, TWO FOCUS GROUPS AND 10 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED. THE STUDY PROPOSES A MODEL OF ICT USE AND ITS EFFECTS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE, INTEGRATING SEVERAL TYPES OF DISABILITIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ICT APPROPRIATION BY DISABLED USERS DEPENDS ON THEIR PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY IN ICT. ICT USE CAN LEAD TO NEGATIVE EFFECTS, INCLUDING SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND LOW PERCEIVED NORMALCY.

FORMATION OF DIGITAL CAPITAL AND ITS MEASUREMENT MODEL IS ANALYSED THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIZATION OF THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN THIS AREA. WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF EXPERT INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED DURING SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF 2021 TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE CONCEPT OF DIGITAL CAPITAL IS PERCEIVED BY RUSSIAN MEDIA RESEARCHERS, EDUCATORS, JOURNALISTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE RESPONDENTS' ANSWERS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN SUB-THEMES OF DIGITAL CAPITAL IN EXPERT DISCOURSE: WELL-BEING OF THE INDIVIDUAL, DIGITAL CONTENT, DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, MATERIAL RESOURCES, GOVERNMENT, DIGITAL INEQUALITY, MEDIA EDUCATION AND MEDIA LITERACY. THE ARTICLE POINTED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL CAPITAL AS A NEW HYBRID META CAPITAL IN THE PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL SPHERES OF HUMAN LIFE IN THE MODERN DIGITAL WORLD, AS WELL AS TO THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN OVERCOMING DIGITAL INEQUALITY AND FORMING DIGITAL CAPITAL OF CITIZENS. WE IDENTIFIED THE ISSUE OF MEASURING DIGITAL CAPITAL GIVEN THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS AND EMERGENCE OF NEW SERVICES, PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES. THE RESEARCH PROVIDED SOME INSIGHTS INTO SUCH ASPECTS OF DIGITAL CAPITAL AS SAFE FUNCTIONING IN THE DIGITAL MEDIA COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT AND CAPACITY TO CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE DIGITAL CONTENT.

ADVANCES IN THIS FIELD DETERMINE THE CREATION OF MACHINES CAPABLE OF LEARNING AND PERFORMING OF PREVIOUSLY PURELY HUMAN COGNITIVE TASKS. AI IS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS IN THE ERA OF CONVERGENCE OF TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES FOR HUMANS, CULTURE, SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT. SINCE AI IS A COGNITIVE TECHNOLOGY, ITS VARIOUS ASPECTS ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED WITH THE MAIN FORMS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY: EDUCATION, SCIENCE, CULTURE AND COMMUNICATION. ALGORITHMS OF SOCIAL NETWORKS AND NEWS SITES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION AND AFFECT THE PERCEPTION OF THE CONCEPTS 'FACTS' AND 'TRUTH', AFFECT POLITICAL INTERACTION AND ACTIVITY. MACHINE LEARNING CAN REINFORCE AND DEEPEN BIAS, WHICH, IN TURN, CAN INCREASE INEQUALITY AND ALIENATION, POSE A THREAT TO CULTURAL DIVERSITY. THE SCALE AND POWER OF AI TECHNOLOGIES INCREASE THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, GROUPS AND COUNTRIES, WHICH IS MANIFESTED IN THE 'DIGITAL DIVIDE' WITHIN AND BETWEEN COUNTRIES. THUS, ALTHOUGH AI HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY FOR THE BETTER, PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF AGGRAVATING EXISTING INEQUALITIES AND IMBALANCES, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS.

HOWEVER, THE RECENT RESEARCH POINTS TO THE FACT THAT OFTEN SUCH IMPACTS ARE OVERESTIMATED, AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION DIGITALIZATION ARE MORE MODEST THAN EXPECTED. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THAT IS INSUFFICIENT ADOPTION OF DIGITAL PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY CHANNELS ESPECIALLY IN THE COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA WHERE DIGITAL BY DEFAULT PRINCIPLE HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. THE SIGNIFICANT VARIANCE IN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT MAKES RUSSIA AN INTERESTING CASE FOR RESEARCH AND COMPARISON BOTH FOR DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING NATIONS. THIS PAPER AIMS AT IDENTIFYING THE FACTORS INFLUENCING CITIZEN ADOPTION OF DIGITAL PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY CHANNELS IN RUSSIAN REGIONS. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL LITERATURE, WE SELECTED 11 POSSIBLE FACTORS THAT COULD BE RELATED TO THE EXTENT OF ADOPTION OF ELECTRONIC PUBLIC SERVICES AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL. WHILE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WAS FOUND WITH MOST VARIABLES CONSIDERED, NO SUCH INTERRELATION WAS CONFIRMED FOR AGE AND INFORMATION SECURITY RISKS INDICATORS.

TO IDENTIFY THE PECULIARITIES OF THIS PROCESS, THE AUTHORS IMPLEMENT CLASSICAL GENERAL SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF COGNITION AND SPECIAL METHODS USED IN SOCIO-POLITICAL AND HISTORICAL-LEGAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. TO DETERMINE THE PECULIARITIES OF THE FORMATION OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL DIGITALIZATION, THE AUTHORS IDENTIFIED THE ESSENCE OF THIS PROCESS, ITS PREREQUISITES AND RESULTS, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS WITH DIGITALIZATION. THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIED THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE POLITICAL COURSE OF RUSSIA. NOWADAYS, THE COUNTRY AIMS TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE POPULATION IN TERMS OF INTRODUCING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IN EVERYDAY LIFE. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT THE FORMATION OF RUSSIAN LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBAL DIGITALIZATION DIRECTLY DEPENDS ON THE VALUES AND CAPABILITIES OF RUSSIAN SOCIETY TO CREATE A MECHANISM TO GUARANTEE THE EDUCATION OF NATIONAL LEGAL CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THIS PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF VARIOUS INNOVATIONS, INCLUDING GLOBAL DIGITALIZATION ITSELF. CURRENTLY, RUSSIA NEEDS TO REVIVE NATIONAL VALUES THAT DETERMINE THE FUTURE OF SOCIETY, THE COUNTRY, AND THE ROLE AND PLACE OF THE COUNTRY IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA. THIS NEED IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE DURING GLOBAL DIGITALIZATION, WHICH PRECLUDES THE ISOLATION OF ANY STATE OR REGION. THESE FACTS ALLOW US TO CONSIDER DIGITALIZATION AS ONE OF THE LEADING CRITERIA FOR THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF MODERN SOCIETY. IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTE THE COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THIS PROCESS, FROM THE ECONOMY TO THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE MAIN INDICATOR OF THE EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITALIZATION IN ALL SPHERES OF SOCIETY IS NOT ONLY THE LEVEL OF MASTERY AND SKILLS TO WORK WITH IT BUT ALSO THE RESULT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIETY ITSELF, WHICH IS LARGELY REFLECTED IN THE LEVEL OF LEGAL AWARENESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IN THE WORLD OF NANO-TECHNOLOGY, INFORMATIZATION AND COMPUTERIZATION SERVE AS A PLATFORM FOR DIGITALIZATION. IN CONTRAST, DIGITALIZATION FORMS A KIND OF TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING THE USERS (REGARDLESS OF GENDER, AGE, INCOME, OR EDUCATION) TO SELF-DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THEIR CONTACTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF DAILY LIFE.","NORTH CAUCASIAN FED UNIV, STAVROPOL, RUSSIA.;  MIREA RUSSIAN TECHNOL UNIV BRANCH STAVROPOL, STAVROPOL, RUSSIA.","RYASNYANSKAYA, NA (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), NORTH CAUCASIAN FED UNIV, STAVROPOL, RUSSIA.","DOBRINSKAYA D, 2019, DOI 10.22363/2313-2272-2019-19-1-108-120; DROZDOVA A, 2019; KOZYREV A, 2018; KUPRIYANOVSKY V, 2017; LISENKOVA A, 2019, DOI 10.5840/dspl20192117; SMIRNOV D, 2019; SMIRNOV D, 2020; TERESHCHENKO E, 2017; TROFIMOV M, 2021, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-69421-0_115; VOLKOV A, 2021; ZHUZHGOV I, 2019",0,2022,COMPUTER SCIENCE,WOS:000759460600023,ISI,NORTH CAUCASIAN FED UNIV;MIREA RUSSIAN TECHNOL UNIV BRANCH STAVROPOL,NORTH CAUCASIAN FED UNIV,NA,"RYASNYANSKAYA NA, 2022, NA","RYASNYANSKAYA NA, 2022, NA",RUSSIA;RUSSIA,10.1007/978-3-030-93244-2_23,978-3-030-93244-2; 978-3-030-93243-5,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS; COMPUTER SCIENCE, THEORY & METHODS",0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,NA,WOS

RES.,ARTICLE,INFORMATION COMPETENCY; ICT; DIGITAL DIVIDE; GENDER; UNIVERSITY; INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,PIM,"THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO DELVE INTO THE PROCESS OF PERSONAL MANAGEMENT OF DIGITAL INFORMATION AMONG SPANISH UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THEIR FINAL YEAR AND TO ANALYZE WHETHER THERE ARE SIMILARITIES OR DIFFERENCES REGARDING STUDENTS' GENDER. A NON-EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED OF AN EXPLORATORY TYPE AND BASED ON A QUESTIONNAIRE AS A SINGLE DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENT. THE INSTRUMENT WAS VALIDATED BY MEANS OF EXPERTS' JUDGEMENT, COGNITIVE INTERVIEW, AND CONSTRUCT VALIDITY. A TOTAL OF 2,054 STUDENTS' SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED, SOURCED FROM ALL AREAS OF KNOWLEDGE, IN 75 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES. THESE SURVEYS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE INFORMATION SEARCH, SELECTION, ORGANIZATION, PROCESSING, AND CREATION PROCESSES. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE A POSITIVE SELF-CONCEPT ABOUT THEIR OWN COMPETENCE FOR PERSONAL MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THEY FAIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE POSSIBILITIES THAT THE DIGITAL WORLD OFFERS THEM. WOMEN SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR MORE DIVERSE RESOURCES THAN MEN. THEY HAVE BETTER JUDGMENT WHEN IT COMES TO SELECTING AND PROCESSING THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. MALE STUDENTS RELY MORE OFTEN THAN FEMALE ONES ON DIGITAL MEDIUMS WHEN ORGANIZING AND CREATING INFORMATION AND CHOOSE TO PUBLISH THE INFORMATION IN LESS COMPLEX AND MORE POPULAR FORMATS THAN THEIR FEMALE COUNTERPARTS. THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE PRESENT STUDY MATCH THOSE OF THE MAJORITY OF REVIEWED STUDIES, NAMELY REGARDING THE ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION, CONTEXTUAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION, SUCH AS THIRD-PARTY SUPPORT, AND ALSO IN RELATION TO THE INCREASING IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT PROCESSES.","UNIV MURCIA, DEPT THEORY & HIST EDUC, MURCIA, SPAIN.;  UNIV MURCIA, DEPT DIDACT & SCH MANAGEMENT, MURCIA, SPAIN.","VICENT, PL (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), FAC EDUC, DEPT TEORIA & HIST EDUC, CAMPUS UNIV ESPINARDO, MURCIA 30100, SPAIN.","ABDOLAHI N, 2015; ACRL, 2000; ALI I, 2022, DOI 10.1177/0961000621996410; ALON L, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2020.106292; AMEEN K, 2016; ANDERSON P, 2002, DOI 10.1076/chin.8.2.71.8724; ARIAS A, 2008, DOI 10.3989/redc.2008.v31.i3.436; BERGMAN O, 2003, DOI 10.1002/asi.10283; BERGMAN O, 2013, DOI 10.1108/ap-04-2013-0032; BOEKAERTS M, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0959-4752(96)00015-1; CASTA?EDA L, 2013; CHAUDHRY A, 2015; CHEN Z, 2013, DOI 10.1109/iccis.2013.105; COMAS R, 2011, DOI 10.3989/redc.2011.1.769; DIEKEMA A, 2014, DOI 10.1002/asi.23117; ERICKSON T, 2006, DOI 10.1145/1107458.1107495; ESPINOSA M P P, 2013; FAIZE F, 2018; FENG Y, 2019, DOI 10.1002/asi.24253; FERRAN-FERRER N, 2009, DOI 10.3145/epi.2009.jul.02; FERRARI A, 2013, DOI 10.2788/52966; HAJIBAYOVA L, 2019; HARISANTY D, 2018; INDRATMO I, 2008; JONES J, 2007; JONES S, 1997, DOI 10.1080/014492997119888; KEARNS L R, 2014, DOI 10.24059/olj.v18i1.296; MARSHALL C C, 2007; MARTIN E, 2007; MIDGLEY C, 2000; OTOPAH F, 2013, DOI 10.1108/00012531311313970; PINTRICH P R, 1991; PRENDES M P, 2010; PRENDES M, 2014, DOI 10.21556/edutec.2014.47.139; PRENDES-ESPINOSA M, 2016, DOI 10.7203/relieve.22.2.7228; SINN D, 2017, DOI 10.1108/lht-09-2016-0103; STEWART K, 2012; SUREDA J, 2007; SYN S, 2020, DOI 10.1108/ajim-05-2020-0163; WARRAICH N, 2018, DOI 10.1108/ils-07-2018-0064; WHITTAKER S, 2011",0,2022,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,WOS:000768202600008,ISI,UNIV MURCIA;UNIV MURCIA,CAMPUS UNIV ESPINARDO,NA,"VICENT PL, 2022, J NEW APPROACHES EDUC RES","VICENT PL, 2022, J NEW APPROACHES EDUC RES",SPAIN;SPAIN,10.7821/naer.2022.1.734,NA,EDUCATION & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH,0,"UNIV ALICANTE, GRUPO INVESTIGACION EDUTIC-ADEI","MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND COMPETITIVENESS, SPAIN",WOS

OBJECTIVE: TO ANALYSE THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF TEACHERS IN THE CANARY ISLANDS WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION OF ICT FOR PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISABILITIES. METHOD: A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH A SAMPLE OF 678 TEACHERS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE USED WAS CALLED DIAGNOSIS AND TEACHER TRAINING FOR THE INCORPORATION OF ICT IN STUDENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. RESULTS: GLOBAL ICT KNOWLEDGE SCORED SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE AVERAGE (20,48 VS. 30,00). ACCORDING TO GENDER, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE AUDITORY AND COGNITIVE DIMENSIONS IN FAVOUR OF FEMALES (P < 0,05). THOSE AGED 26-35 YEARS SCORED HIGHER ON ALL DIMENSIONS (P < 0,05). CONCLUSION: TEACHERS IN THE CANARY ISLANDS SHOW A LOW LEVEL OF TRAINING WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICATION OF ICT WITH STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES.

THIS PAPER OUTLINES THE DEVELOPMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF THE DDS-INDEX AND USES IT TO ANALYSE DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE OF DIGITALISATION OF STUDENTS IN ORDER TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT A DIGITAL DIVIDE AT UNIVERSITIES.","KARL FRANZENS UNIV GRAZ, GRAZ, AUSTRIA.","JANSCHITZ, G (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), KARL FRANZENS UNIV GRAZ, FAC BUSINESS ECON & SOCIAL SCI, DEPT BUSINESS EDUC & DEV, UNIV STR 15-G1, A-8010 GRAZ, AUSTRIA.","AL KHATEEB A, 2017, DOI 10.5539/ies.v10n12p38; ALARCON R, 2020, DOI 10.1111/bjet.12919; ALBON C, 2018; ANDROSCH H, 2017; ARNHOLD K, 2003; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277; BEDENLIER S, 2020; BLANK G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.777758; BOLLEN K, 1991, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.110.2.305; BOLLEN K, 2017, DOI 10.1037/met0000056; BOLLEN K, 2011; BONFADELLI H, 2002, DOI 10.1177/0267323102017001607; BOURDIEU P, 1973; BOURDIEU P, 1971; BUHNER M, 2011; BUZZETTO-HOLLYWOOD N, 2018, DOI 10.28945/4029; CAENA F, 2019, DOI 10.1111/ejed.12345; CASTANO-MUNOZ J, 2010, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v7i1.661; CASTELLS M, 2005; CAVENG R, 2014; CHOWDHURY S, 2006, DOI 10.1080/00220380600741904; COHEN J, 2016, DOI 10.1111%2f1467-8721.ep10768783; COHEN R, 2009; DECANCQ K, 2013, DOI 10.1080/07474938.2012.690641; DIAMANTOPOULOS A, 2001, DOI 10.1509/jmkr.38.2.269.18845; DIAMANTOPOULOS A, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2006.00500.x; DIAMANTOPOULOS A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.009; DIEKMANN A, 2010; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1086/ahr/69.3.805; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DROSSEL K, 2019, DOI 10.31244/dds.2019.04.03; EDWARDS J, 2001, DOI 10.1177/109442810142004; EICHHORN M, 2018; EICHHORN M, 2018; FALLOON G, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11423-020-09767-4; FICKERMANN D, 2021; GALANEK J, 2019; GELMAN A, 2017, DOI 10.1111/rssa.12276; GERHOLZ K, 2018; GIERDOWSKI D, 2020; GROSCH M, 2011; GUI M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389751; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00396.x; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HOLTGREWE U, 2021; HOSKINS B, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s11205-008-9271-2; HU L, 1999, DOI 10.1080/10705519909540118; HUBER S, 2020; INITIATIVE D, 2016; INITIATIVE D, 2020; JANDURA O, 2015; JANSCHITZ G, 2021; JANSCHITZ G, 2020, DOI 10.25364/978-3-903374-00-3.attachment002; JANSCHITZ G, 2021; JANSCHITZ G, 2020, DOI 10.25364/978-3-903374-00-3.attachment001; JANSCHITZ G, 2019; JARVIS C, 2003, DOI 10.1086/376806; KEHM B, 2006; KELLEVON U, 2009; KERRES M, 2016; KLAFKI W, 2007; KLEINMANN B, 2008; KLEINMANN B, 2005; KLINE R B, 2015; KOPP M, 2021; KOPP M, 2019; KUTSCHER N, 2019, DOI 10.31244/dds.2019.04.02; LEBLANC P, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00091383.2018.1507370; LEE N, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2012.08.004; LOJEWSKI J, 2017; MARGARYAN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.09.004; MARR M, 2019; MARR M, 2003; MARSHALL S, 2018; MAYRHOFER L, 2019; MAZZIOTTA M, 2013; NATARAJ, 2014; NORRIS P, 2001; NULTY D, 2008, DOI 10.1080/02602930701293231; O'BRIEN M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10734-018-0250-5; PAUSHASEBRINK I, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-02653-0; PE?A-L?PEZ I, 2010, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v7i1.659; PENA-LOPEZ I, 2010; PERSIKE M, 2016; PESSL G, 2021; PETER J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.005; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424843; RELLES S, 2013, DOI 10.1353/jhe.2013.0025; RICOY C, 2013; ROELSTRAETE B, 2011; ROHS M, 2015; RUBIN D, 1976, DOI 10.1093/biomet/63.3.581; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; SCHULMEISTER R, 2012; SCOLARI C, 2019, DOI 10.18261/issn.1891-943x-2019-03-04-06; SELWYN N, 2010, DOI 10.7238/rusc.v7i1.660; STEINER M, 2020; STRUBING J, 2019; TABER K, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s11165-016-9602-2; TAPSCOTT D, 1998; TAWFIK A, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s11528-016-0109-5; TEMPL M, 2020; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; TONDEUR J, 2017, DOI 10.1111/bjet.12380; VAN BUUREN S, 2018, DOI 10.1201/9780429492259; VAN BUUREN S, 2020; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; WEIGOLD A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0894439318783435; ZILLIEN N, 2009",0,2022,SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000746857600005,ISI,KARL FRANZENS UNIV GRAZ,KARL FRANZENS UNIV GRAZ,NA,"JANSCHITZ G, 2022, BMS-BULL SOCIOL METHODOL","JANSCHITZ G, 2022, BMS-BULL SOCIOL METHODOL",AUSTRIA,10.1177/07591063211061760,NA,SOCIOLOGY,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"STATE OF STYRIA, AUSTRIA",WOS

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER USED AN EXPLORATORY APPROACH. THE AUTHORS EMPIRICALLY ASSESSED THE PROVISION OF EGOVERNMENT SERVICES IN EACH OF THE 36 ECUADORIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOLLOWING THE LOCAL ONLINE SERVICE INDEX (LOSI) MEASUREMENT SCALE PROPOSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS, AND THEN EVALUATED THE DRIVERS OF THE EGOVERNMENT DIVIDE AT A LOCAL LEVEL. ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED. FINDINGS THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS DRIVEN BY INCOME AND EDUCATION DISPARITIES, AND THAT EGOVERNMENT AVAILABILITY IS DRIVEN BY ICT USE. IT APPEARS THAT PROPER ATTENTION TO TECHNOLOGY USE BY ITS CITIZENS IS NOT BEING GIVEN BY LOCAL-LEVEL POLICYMAKERS IN ECUADOR WHEN THEY DEVISE THEIR EGOVERNMENT STRATEGY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS BECAUSE THE DATA WERE AVAILABLE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AGGREGATION, THERE MAY BE SOME INACCURACY OF THE INDICATORS AND LACK OF GENERALIZABILITY. RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESES WITH DATA AT LOWER LEVELS OF AGGREGATION AND FROM DIFFERENT LATITUDES TO PROVIDE A COMPARATIVE VIEW BETWEEN COUNTRIES. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER INCLUDES IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYMAKERS AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES REGARDING HOW THE LIMITATIONS ON EGOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT MAY BE MITIGATED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY FULFILS THE NEED TO ASSESS DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND ITS IMPACT ON EGOVERNMENT SERVICES AT A CITY LEVEL IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY.","UNIV TECN COTOPAXI, LATACUNGA, ECUADOR.;  UNIV NOVA LISBOA, NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH NOVA IMS, LISBON, PORTUGAL.","NARANJO-ZOLOTOV, M (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV NOVA LISBOA, NOVA INFORMAT MANAGEMENT SCH NOVA IMS, LISBON, PORTUGAL.","ABU-TAYEH G, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s12599-018-0530-8;

DATA FROM THE EU SAMPLE OF THE PROGRAMME FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ASSESSMENT (PISA) 2018 ARE USED FOR THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT MALE STUDENTS WITH IMMIGRANT BACKGROUND AND HIGHLY EDUCATED PARENTS HAVE THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF EDUCATIONAL ICT USE, WHILE NATIVE FEMALE STUDENTS WITH LESS EDUCATED PARENTS SHOW THE LOWEST FREQUENCY. HOWEVER, THE GROUP CATEGORIES ALSO INTERACT: AN ACADEMIC FAMILY BACKGROUND IS MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR STUDENTS WITH IMMIGRANT BACKGROUND AND FOR BOYS THAN FOR NATIVE STUDENTS AND GIRLS. THE MALE ADVANTAGE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A GENERAL HIGHER FREQUENCY OF BOYS USING ICTS IN THEIR FREE TIME, WHILE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN ACADEMIC FAMILY BACKGROUND IS MAINLY DUE TO A BETTER ENDOWMENT WITH EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AT HOME.

THESE ARE THE OVERARCHING QUESTIONS THAT OUR CASE STUDY INTERROGATES BY OPENING UP THE BLACK BOX OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE VOLATILE AND FAST-TRANSFORMING PERI-URBAN FRINGE OF HYDERABAD, INDIA. WE EXAMINE THE UNFOLDING OF DATA AND INFORMATION PROCESSES THROUGH THE LENS OF ENUMERATION AND COMMUNITY MAPPING EXERCISES CONDUCTED IN A LOW-INCOME NEIGHBOURHOOD. WE ARGUE THAT THE REALISATION OF DATA JUSTICE IS MEDIATED BY 'INFORMATION POLITICS', I.E., THE WAYS IN WHICH INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS THE RISKS AND REWARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, ARE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS INDIVIDUAL ACTORS AND IDENTITY GROUPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. THE DEMOCRATISING POTENTIAL OF EMERGING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IS SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES ACROSS GENDER, CASTE, CLASS, AND EVEN LINGUISTIC LINES. OUR CASE STUDY UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE OF SUCH A STRUCTURAL UNDERSTANDING OF DATA JUSTICE AND ALSO SUGGESTS DIRECTIONS FOR EMBEDDING JUSTICE IN DATA PROCESSES. OUR FINDINGS REVEAL AN ARENA OF STARK INFORMATIONAL DISPARITIES BETWEEN VULNERABLE, INDIGENT POPULATIONS AND THE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED DIGITAL DATA APPARATUSES USED TO ENCODE THEM. EFFORTS TO PROMOTE DATA JUSTICE MUST TAKE EXPLICIT COGNISANCE OF THESE DISPARITIES AND FRAGMENTATION AND RECOGNISE THE INTERNAL STRUCTURAL DIFFERENTIATION OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.

THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 2019 IN POLAND, USING A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (A STRUCTURED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW) AND INTERPRETATIVE PARADIGM. THE RESPONDENTS WERE 8 SPECIALISTS, EDUCATORS OF OLDER ADULTS, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS DEALING WITH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: A ACTIVITY CENTER, A PUBLIC LIBRARY, A NURSING HOME, AN NGO, AND A UNIVERSITY OF THE THIRD AGE. TRIANGULATION OF THE RESULTS LED TO SEVERAL IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS REGARDING TO THE EXPECTATIONS, EXPERIENCES, CHALLENGES AND POSTULATED SUPPORTING ACTIONS RELATED TO DIGITAL INCLUSION. BASED ON THE RESULTS GATHERED, WE HAVE NOTICED THAT EDUCATORS READILY SHARE THEIR DIDACTIC AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXPERIENCE. THE RESPONDENTS WERE OPEN TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OWN TEACHING COMPETENCES, AND RECOGNIZED THE ROLE OF LIFELONG LEARNING. THEY OFTEN HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE DIGITAL EDUCATION OF OLDER ADULTS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE THE DIGITAL LITERACY OF OLDER ADULTS ARE IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF THEIR NON-FORMAL EDUCATION (I.E. IT IS CARRIED OUT BY EDUCATORS HOLDING NO FORMAL QUALIFICATIONS).

WE CONCEPTUALIZE ENGAGEMENT IN THE SHARING ECONOMY AS A FORM OF ONLINE PARTICIPATION, AND APPLY A DIGITAL INEQUALITIES PERSPECTIVE TO EXAMINE THE SOCIAL STRATIFICATION OF COMMERCIAL SHARING. BASED ON THE INTERNET ACCESS MODEL ESTABLISHED BY VAN DIJK, WE ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL STRUCTURAL ANTECEDENTS ON VARIOUS ACCESS STAGES. INITIAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE SHARING ECONOMY IS CHARACTERIZED BY SECOND-ORDER CONSUMPTION, ADDRESSING USER WANTS MORE THAN NEEDS. THEREFORE, WE DRAW ON BOURDIEU TO COMPLEMENT VAN DIJK'S MODEL THROUGH A HABITUAL PERSPECTIVE. ANALYZING DATA COLLECTED IN A SURVEY OF MORE THAN 6000 INDIVIDUALS FROM 12 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WE FIND THAT WHILE SOCIAL STRUCTURAL ANTECEDENTS ARE CRITICAL IN EXPLAINING INITIAL USAGE OF SHARING SERVICES, THEIR EFFECT ON REPEAT USAGE IS LESS EVIDENT. SOME INDICATORS, SUCH AS EDUCATION AND SOCIAL CAPITAL, EVEN NEGATIVELY RELATE TO USAGE INTENSITY. IN TURN, WE FIND THAT A HABITUS OF INNOVATIVENESS AND COMMUNITY-ORIENTATION SIGNIFICANTLY BOLSTERS INITIAL USAGE, BUT MATERIALISM, RATHER THAN MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS, CHARACTERIZES HIGHER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT IN THE SHARING ECONOMY.","UNIV LEIPZIG, INST COMMUN & MEDIA STUDIES, LEIPZIG, SAXONY, GERMANY.;  UNIV LEIPZIG, INST COMMUN & MEDIA STUDIES, COMMUN MANAGEMENT, LEIPZIG, SAXONY, GERMANY.","EICHHORN, T (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR), UNIV LEIPZIG, INST COMMUN & MEDIA STUDIES, LEIPZIG, SAXONY, GERMANY.","AGARWAL R, 1998, DOI 10.1287/isre.9.2.204; BLANK G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BLANK G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.777758; BOURDIEU P, 1995; BUCHER E, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.04.002; BUCHI M, 2018; CASEMAJOR N, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0163443715584098; CHALMERS R, 2012; DE HAAN J, 2006; DELOITTE S, 2015; DIMAGGIO P, 2001, DOI 10.1086/ahr/69.3.805; EDELMAN B G, 2014; EDELMAN B, 2017, DOI 10.1257/app.20160213; ETTEMA J, 1977, DOI 10.1177/009365027700400204; EUROBAROMETER, 2018; FLANAGAN C, 2007; FORNELL C, 1981, DOI 10.2307/3151312; FORNO F, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1528008x.2015.1013409; GEFEN D, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0305-0483(00)00021-9; GERWE O, 2020, DOI 10.5465/amp.2017.0010; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; HARGITTAI E, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0894439310397146; HARGITTAI E, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0894439308318213; HELLMANN K, 2006; HELLMANN K, 2004; HINDMAN D, 2009, DOI 10.1177/107769900908600405; HOFFMANN C, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.991343; HWANG J, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jcm-10-2015-1560; IGNATOW G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1301519; JEHLICKA P, 2017, DOI 10.1111/soru.12160; JENNINGS M, 2003, DOI 10.1086/376947; KRUEGER B, 2002, DOI 10.1177/1532673x02030005002; KWAK N, 1999, DOI 10.1177/009365099026004002; LITERAT I, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444816639036; LUTZ C, 2014, DOI 10.5210/fm.v19i7.5260; LUTZ C, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1293129; MADDEN M, 2017; MODY M, 2017, DOI 10.1108/ijchm-09-2016-0501; NETEMEYER R, 2003; NEWLANDS G, 2018, DOI 10.5210/fm.v23i11.8159; PISCICELLI L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2014.07.032; R CORE T, 2021; RECKWITZ A, 2006; RICHINS M, 2004, DOI 10.1086/383436; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ROGERS E, 2010; ROSENBLAT A, 2017, DOI 10.1002/poi3.153; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; SMITH, 2016; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; TSATSOU P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0163443710393865; TUSSYADIAH I, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhm.2016.03.005; VAN DER GAAG M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2004.10.001; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444817715282; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; VAN DIJK J, 2014; VAN DIJK J, 2013; WEST S G, 2015; YANG S, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jsm-01-2016-0042",9,2022,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,WOS:000547691600001,ISI,UNIV LEIPZIG;UNIV LEIPZIG,UNIV LEIPZIG,NA,"EICHHORN T, 2022, INFO COMMUN SOC","EICHHORN T, 2022, INFO COMMUN SOC",GERMANY;GERMANY,10.1080/1369118x.2020.1791218,NA,COMMUNICATION; SOCIOLOGY,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",H2020 LEIT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES [732117],WOS

HOWEVER, THE SO-CALLED GRAY DIGITAL DIVIDE (GDD) MAY UNDERMINE THE POTENTIALITIES OF SNSS.
