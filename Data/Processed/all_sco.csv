THE PAPER DISCUSSES THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF THE WEB SUCH AS OPENNESS, FREEDOM, AND EQUALITY, AND ANALYZES THEIR SCOPES UNDER INCREASING ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL INFLUENCES WHICH DEFININE THE WORLD WIDE WEB INFRASTRUCTURE AND ITS POTENTIALS. THIS INCLUDES A COMPARISON OF SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF DIFFERENT SEARCH ENGINES WITHIN A FAST GROWING SEARCH INDUSTRY THAT MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A DISTORTION OF INTERNET CONTENT AND FOR A CERTAIN MODE OF WEB TRAFFIC.

AN EXAMINATION OF THESE PRECONDITIONS IS HELPFUL FOR RESISTING THE FURTHER WIDENING OF DIGITAL DIVIDES. THE ONTOLOGICAL BELIEF IN THE RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE OF CODE IS DEPENDENT ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE ""DIGITAL"" IS. HERE IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE DIGITAL IS NOT A NATURAL KIND, BUT A CONCEPT THAT IS RELATIVE TO OUR PRACTICES OF INTERPRETATION. AN INTERPRETATIVE SYSTEM THAT SEES CODE AS SOMETHING THAT CAN OR SHOULD ALWAYS BE OWNED IMPLIES AN INCREASE OF SOCIAL CONTROL AND THREATENS VITAL PROCESSES OF KNOWLEDGE CREATION THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR AN OPEN AND EGALITARIAN INFORMATION SOCIETY. THE ONTOLOGICAL BELIEF IN ""DIGITAL CODE"" THUS PROVIDES THE BACKDROP FOR AN ETHICAL VIEW OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY.

USING HARDIN'S TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS, WE SHOW THAT AN IMPROPER OPENING AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT (INFOSPHERE) IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE A TRAGEDY OF THE DIGITAL COMMONS (TDC). IN THE COURSE OF THE ANALYSIS, WE EXPLAIN WHY ADAR AND HUBERMAN'S PREVIOUS USE OF HARDIN'S TRAGEDY TO INTERPRET CERTAIN RECENT PHENOMENA IN THE INFOSPHERE (ESPECIALLY PEER-TO-PEER COMMUNICATION) MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY SATISFACTORY. WE THEN SEEK TO PROVIDE AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THE TDC THAT AVOIDS THE POSSIBLE SHORTCOMINGS OF THEIR MODEL. NEXT, WE ANALYSE SOME PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY THE APPLICATION OF CLASSICAL ETHICS IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE TDC. IN THE CONCLUSION, WE OUTLINE THE KIND OF WORK THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AN ETHICAL APPROACH THAT MAY BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BUT AVOID THE TDC. © 2004 KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS.","DIPARTIMENTO DI FILOLOGIA CLASSICA E DI SCIENZE FILOSOFICHE, UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI LECCE, ITALY, INFORMATION ETHICS RESEARCH GROUP, COMPUTING LABORATORY, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;DIPARTIMENTO DI SCIENZE FILOSOFICHE, UNIVERSITÀ DEGLI STUDI DI BARI, ITALY, INFORMATION ETHICS RESEARCH GROUP, COMPUTING LABORATORY, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","GRECO, G.

PAUL G; STEGBAUER C,IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN YOUNG AND ELDERLY PEOPLE INCREASING?,FIRST MONDAY,FIRST MONDAY,REVIEW,NA,NA,"ELDERLY PEOPLE STILL PLAY A MINOR ROLE IN RESEARCH ON INFORMATION NEEDS AND USAGE PATTERNS OF INTERNET USERS. ONLINE RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY GROUPS LOOK OPTIMISTICALLY AT THE (ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL) POTENTIAL OF THE ACTIVE AND TECHNOLOGY-SKILLED ELDERLY; OTHER APPROACHES DEALING WITH THE SOCIAL APPROPRIATION OF TECHNOLOGY SEE OBSTACLES AND STRESS THE DANGERS OF AN INCREASING DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN GENERATIONS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO REFER TO TAKEN FOR GRANTED NORMATIVE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE DISCOURSE, HIGHLIGHTING DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF THE INTERNET. USING THE CONCEPT OF TECHNOLOGICAL GENERATIONS WE LOOK AT FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEARNING OF YOUNG AND ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE GERMAN CONTEXT. WE USE SURVEY MATERIAL AND FIELD IMPRESSIONS WE GAINED IN VARIOUS TECHNOLOGY RELATED STUDIES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ""TWO WORLDS APART"" ASSUMPTION (YOUNG VS. ELDERLY PEOPLE) IS TOO SIMPLISTIC. FACTORS LIKE GENDER, EDUCATION AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS STILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR ACCEPTANCE AND DIFFUSION OF A TECHNOLOGY. THE DIFFUSION RATE AMONG THE ELDERLY IS INCREASING, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND THE FIGURES OF THE YOUNG USERS. CULTURAL PREPARATIONS AND EASY ACCESS MODES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE ELDERLY, WHO COULD MAKE USE OF LATECOMER ADVANTAGES. INFORMAL LEARNING AND PEER GROUP SUPPORT WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR THE DIFFUSION OF THE INTERNET AMONG THE ELDERLY. IN OUR CONCLUSIONS WE LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC SOCIAL STATUS OF THE ELDERLY COHORT, WHICH MAKES A COMPARISON WITH OTHER SOCIAL GROUPS VERY DIFFICULT.","SOZIOLOGISCHES FORSCHUNGSINSTITUT GÖTTINGEN, GERMANY;UNIVERSITY OF FRANKFURT, GERMANY",NA,"BINGHAM N, 1999, DOI 10.1068/d170655; BINGHAM N, 1999; BLAU P, 1984; BURKART R, 1998; COSSE M, 2003; DOLATA U, 2003; DOMATHOB J, 1996; DÜSSELDORP M, 1998; ERKERT T, 1998; FRINDTE W, 2001; GERSHUNY J, 2002; GIDDENS A, 1991; GRUBAUER F, 1998; GURAK L, 1996; HORSTMANN R, 1991; JÄCKEL M, 1994; KIELHOLZ A, 1999; KONRAD W, 1999; KORENMAN J, 1996; KÜHN K, 1999; LARSEN R, 1993; LAUFFER J, 1996; LAZARSFELD P, 1982; LÜHRS R, 2004; MALONE T, 1998; MARKUS M, 1987, DOI 10.1177/009365087014005003; MARQUET P, 1999; MÜNNICH M, 2001; NEUSEL A, 1999; NORMAN D, 1998; CONTEXT A, 2001; OCHEL J, 2003; ÖSTLUND B, 2003; PAUL G, 1989; PAUL G, 2004; PISA E, 2002; ROBINSON J, 2002; ROESLER R, 1997; ROGERS E, 1983; ROSENMAYR L, 2001; ROST M, 1997; SACKMANN R, 1994; SAXER U, 1987; SCHÖNBERGER K, 2000; SCHULZE E, 2003; SCHWARZ N, 1998; SPROULL L, 1991; STADELHOFER C, 1999; STEGBAUER C, 2001; TULLY C, 2003; TULLY C, 2000; WERLE R, 1995; WETZSTEIN T, 1996; WINKLER G, 2002; WOLF C, 1997; ZERDICK A, 1999; ZWICK M, 2000",36,2005,NA,2-S2.0-27944464580,SCOPUS,SOZIOLOGISCHES FORSCHUNGSINSTITUT GÖTTINGEN;UNIVERSITY OF FRANKFURT,NOTREPORTED,NA,"PAUL G, 2005, FIRST MONDAY","PAUL G, 2005, FIRST MONDAY",GERMANY;GERMANY,10.5210/fm.v10i10.1286,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-27944464580&DOI=10.5210%2FFM.V10I10.1286&PARTNERID=40&MD5=916BA88002D32D3FDCD8624553587A4C,NA,NA,FIRST MONDAY,NA,SCO

PROSPECT.,REVIEW,NA,NA,"THE 1990S SAW THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ERA FOR MOST INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. THE RISE OF NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES MEANT THE START OF A PERIOD OF VERY RAPID CHANGES THAT COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED THE DAILY LIFE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE. BUT WHILE THESE DEVELOPMENTS BROUGHT WITH THEM ACTUAL PROGRESS AND HOPES OF FURTHER ADVANCES IN MANY FIELDS (E.G. COMMUNICATIONS, MEDICINE, EDUCATION), THEY ALSO HAD THE EFFECT OF LEAVING SOME PEOPLE BEHIND. AS PATRICK COHENDET AND LUCY STOJAK ARGUE HERE, THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOCIETY HAS INDEED MARGINALIZED SOME GROUPS IN EUROPE, AND THIS ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" (HERE MEASURED MAINLY IN TERMS OF USE OF THE INTERNET) COULD WELL BECOME MORE SERIOUS IF NOTHING IS DONE TO IMPROVE MATTERS. THE AUTHORS BEGIN BY DEFINING WHAT IS MEANT BY ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"", DISTINGUISHING TECHNOLOGICAL (BASICALLY QUANTITATIVE) CONSIDERATIONS FROM A SOCIO-ECONOMIC APPROACH (TAKING ACCOUNT OF QUALITATIVE ASPECTS, SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO USE TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS QUANTITATIVE ONES), WHICH IS THE ONE THEY PREFER. THEY THEN PRESENT A TYPOLOGY OF USERS (AND NON-USERS) OF THE INTERNET, SHOWING THE INEQUALITIES LINKED TO SOCIAL CLASS, GEOGRAPHY, AGE, ETC. AS THE AUTHORS EMPHASIZE, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO NARROW THIS DIVIDE IF THE EUROPEAN UNION IN FUTURE IS TO ACHIEVE ITS AIM OF BECOMING ""THE MOST COMPETITIVE KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY IN THE WORLD""; THIS MUST BE DONE IN ORDER TO PREVENT A WIDENING OF THE GAP BETWEEN THE OLDER AND NEWER MEMBERS OF THE EU, AND MORE GENERALLY BETWEEN DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS AND ISOLATED AREAS; AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION GIVEN AN AGEING POPULATION, AS OLDER PEOPLE TEND TO BE LESS COMPUTER-LITERATE. MOREOVER, IT IS ALL TOO CLEAR THAT SIMPLY HAVING THE INFRASTRUCTURES FOR ACCESS TO THE MASS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET IS NOT ENOUGH; PEOPLE MUST ALSO BE ABLE TO SORT OUT THIS INFORMATION, THEN UNDERSTAND AND ASSIMILATE IT. IN OTHER WORDS, FOR A TRULY KNOWLEDGE-BASED SOCIETY TO DEVELOP THERE NEEDS TO BE A GENUINE EFFORT TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. LASTLY, THE ARTICLE PROPOSES A SERIES OF POLICY MEASURES GEARED TO NARROWING THE DIVIDE, STARTING BY INSTALLING THE NECESSARY DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURES ACROSS THE WHOLE OF EUROPE AND PROVIDING UNIVERSAL BROADBAND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, JUST LIKE ACCESS TO THE TELEPHONE IN THE PAST.","BETA, UNIV.

I HAVE USED DATA FROM THE EUROBAROMETER FOR THE YEAR 2003 FOR MY ANALYSIS.THE MAJOR CONCLUSION IS THAT IN SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES EXTENSIVE GENDER INEQUALITY CAN BE OBSERVED IN ACCESS TO THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES. THESE INEQUALITIES ARE MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE GROUP OF WOMEN WITH LOW EDUCATIONAL LEVELS AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT INTEGRATED INTO THE LABOUR MARKET. THE GAPS CAN PARTLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FAMILY-BASED CULTURE THAT CHARACTERIZES SOUTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHERE WOMEN HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN CONFINED TO THE PRIVATE ENVIRONMENT OF THE FAMILY, THUS LIMITING THEIR OPPORTUNITY FOR INTEGRATION INTO THE LABOUR MARKET AND TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

POLICY,ARTICLE,COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; CONSUMPTION; FINLAND; GENERATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION; SOCIAL CHANGE,NA,"PURPOSE – THIS ARTICLE COMPARES CONSUMPTION DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POPULATION GROUPS IN THE FIELDS OF THE TRADITIONAL AND NEW INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINMENT. THE INTEREST IS TO ESTIMATE TO WHAT EXTENT TRADITIONAL INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENDITURE AND EXPENDITURE ON THE NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DISPLAY SIMILAR STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – THE DATA USED IS THE FINNISH EXPENDITURE SURVEY DATA FROM 1998 (N=4359) AND 2001-2002 (N=5495) PROVIDED BY THE STATISTICS FINLAND. THE INFORMATION AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSUMPTION IS STUDIED BY USING PURCHASING COSTS OF BOOKS AND MAGAZINES, TELEVISION LICENSE AND PAY CHANNEL COSTS, VIDEO RENTALS, AND OPERATING COSTS OF PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICES. THE DIFFERENCES BY POPULATION GROUPS ARE ANALYSED ACCORDING TO THE RESPONDENT'S LEVEL OF EDUCATION AND INCOME, TYPE OF HOUSEHOLD, RESPONDENT'S AGE AND GENDER, AND PLACE OF RESIDENCE. FINDINGS – THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DIFFERENCES CONCERNING BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND ESPECIALLY PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICES HAVE INCREASED IN THE 21ST CENTURY. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – THE CONCLUSIONS PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE ARE CONNECTED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES DURING AND AFTER THE PRODUCT CONSOLIDATION IN FINLAND. IN THIS REGARD IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT THE EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS WAS RESTRICTED TO THE USE OF VARIABLES INCLUDING DIFFERENT OPERATING COSTS AND TO A SHORT TIME FRAME IN ONE EUROPEAN COUNTRY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CONSUMPTION DISPARITIES DISPLAY THE SAME STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE REALMS OF BOTH TRADITIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (BOOKS AND MAGAZINES) AND NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (PHONE AND INTERNET SERVICES). DESPITE THE FACT THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS APPARENTLY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE, GROWING DISPARITIES ARE DISPLAYED BY BOTH EDUCATION AND INCOME.

THE SECOND PART OF THE ARTICLE ANALYSES, AS A CASE STUDY, THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS MARKET OF LATVIA, A COUNTRY THAT ENTERED THE EUROPEAN UNION IN MAY 2004, AND WHERE, GIVEN ITS CONDITIONS, MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ESSENTIAL TOOLS FOR THE INCREASE IN BROADBAND ACCESSES, AND MORE GENERALLY, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY.

THESE CHOICES ARE ANALYSED USING A DISCRETE CHOICE MODEL, WHICH REVEALS THAT SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE ADOPTION OF INTERNET SERVICES. PRICE ELASTICITY EFFECTS ALSO VARY BETWEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSEHOLDS: THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH MEMBERS WHO ARE WEALTHIER AND BETTER EDUCATED ARE FOUND TO BE LESS SENSITIVE TO THE PRICE OF INTERNET SERVICES THAN HOUSEHOLDS WHOSE MEMBER COME FROM THE OTHER END OF THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC SCALE.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE VALIDITY OF THAT CLAIM IN THE CASE OF THE ISLE OF MAN (IOM). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A NOMINALIST ONTOLOGY AND POSITIVIST EPISTEMOLOGY CHARACTERIZES THE UNDERPINNING RESEARCH PHILOSOPHY FOR THIS CASE STUDY. RESEARCH DATA CONSISTED OF SECONDARY CENSUS INSTRUMENTS AND PRIMARY DATA DERIVED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH A SAMPLE OF IOM CIVIL SERVANTS. FINDINGS THE FINDINGS WERE THAT DESPITE HAVING BETTER RESULTS IN TERMS OF THE CAUSES OF DIGITAL DIVIDE, THE IOM TRAILED THE UK LEVEL OF INTERNET ACCESS TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE. THIS RESULT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WISDOM OF BASING DIGITAL DIVIDE AND E-GOVERNMENT STRATEGIES ON TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE IOM IS A COMPARATIVELY SMALL ENTITY COMPARED TO THE UK. IN ADDITION, BASING THE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED ON IOM CIVIL SERVANTS ONLY MAY RESULT IN AN ELEMENT OF BIAS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS MANY GOVERNMENTS INVEST CONSIDERABLE SUMS OF MONEY ON THEIR DIGITAL DIVIDE AND E-GOVERNMENT PROGRAMMES WHICH MAY BE MISDIRECTED IF THEY ARE ADDRESSING THE WRONG CAUSES OF IT.

HOWEVER, THIS DIVIDE IS NOT RESTRICTED TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD; WITH THE DIVIDE ALSO PREVALENT WITHIN THE UK, AGAIN PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF INTERNET ACCESS. A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION IS THAT WHILE THE UK AND MANY OF ITS CITIZENS REAP THE BENEFITS THAT THE INTERNET BRINGS, AREAS ARE LEFT EVEN DEEPER IN A STATE OF FINANCIAL EXCLUSION FROM MAINSTREAM BANKING FACILITIES. AS MORE PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CONVENIENCE THE INTERNET CAN BRING TO MANAGING FINANCIAL AFFAIRS, THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS IDENTIFIED A NEED FOR LESS BRANCHES AND STAFF. FROM THEIR UNDERSTANDABLE PERSPECTIVE IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO CLOSE UNPROFITABLE, HIGH RISK BRANCHES.

THREE DATA-GATHERING ACTIVITIES WERE CONDUCTED IN THE UK LOCAL AREAS OF HILLINGDON AND MEDWAY. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATE THAT BY EMPLOYING THE DIFFUSION THEORY OF KING ET AL., THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES ARE REDUCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

THE FOCUS IS ON E-DEMOCRACY; THAT IS, TO WHAT EXTENT LOCAL DEMOCRACY IS ENHANCED BY FACILITATING ONLINE POLITICAL COMMUNICATION. WHAT FORMS OF POLITICAL OR DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE ARE MADE POSSIBLE AND/OR CATALYZED BY THE FORMS OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATION ON THESE WEB SITES? THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT WHEN ONLINE POLITICAL COMMUNICATION IS OBTAINABLE, THE CENTER OF ATTENTION IS INFORMATION PROVISION RATHER THAN ONLINE INTERACTIVITY AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. CONSEQUENTLY, THE NORWEGIAN MUNICIPALITIES PRIMARILY USE THEIR WEB SITES TO STIMULATE ONE OF DAHL'S CLASSIC DEMOCRATIC IDEALS, NAMELY ENLIGHTENED UNDERSTANDING. THE SECOND IDEAL, MEANS FOR EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION, IS NOT PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED. SEVERAL HYPOTHESES ON WHAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THE VARIATION ARE ALSO TESTED. FOUR FINDINGS EMERGED AS PARTICULARLY INTERESTING: FIRST, COMMUNICATION NEEDS AND OVERALL RESOURCES EXPLAINED MUCH OF THE VARIATION.

ECON. SOC.,ARTICLE,ARAB WORLD; DEVELOPMENT; DIGITAL DIVIDE; HUMAN CAPITAL; ICT; INTERNET; REVENUE,NA,"THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT ACCESS TO ICTS IS LIMITED IN THE ARAB WORLD AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THE REGION SUFFERS FROM A ""DOUBLE DIGITAL DIVIDE"". THE FIRST DIVIDE SEPARATES THE ARAB GULF MONARCHIES, WHICH ARE MORE ECONOMICALLY-ABLE AND ADVANCED WITH RESPECT TO ICTS, FROM THE REST OF THE ARAB WORLD, WHERE ACCESS TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES REMAINS A CHALLENGE. THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A REFLECTION, ESSENTIALLY, OF DEEPER INEQUALITIES OF REVENUES AND DIFFERENCES OF HUMAN CAPITAL BETWEEN THESE TWO SUB-REGIONS. EMPIRICAL RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT INCOME (REPRESENTED AS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT -GNP PER CAPITA) SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE DIFFUSION OF ICTS (CONNECTION TO INTERNET) WHILE HUMAN CAPITAL DOES NOT. THE SECOND DIVIDE - WHICH NOW EXISTS BETWEEN THE ARAB NATIONS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD, IN PARTICULAR THE OECD COUNTRIES - BASICALLY EMANATES FROM THE INSUFFICIENCY OF INFRASTRUCTURES, OFTEN PROHIBITIVE COSTS OF ICTS, LACK OF LOCAL CREATION OF CONTENTS, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, AND UNEQUAL CAPACITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE, AT BOTH ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LEVELS FROM ACTIVITIES WITH HIGH INTENSITY OF INFORMATION, WHICH EFFECTIVELY POSTPONE THE ASSIMILATION OF ICTS BY ARAB COUNTRIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARAB SOCIETY OF INFORMATION. LASTLY, ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ICT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARAB WORLD, THIS PAPER ALSO SHOWS THAT ICTS ARE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA BUT AT THE SAME TIME POSE CHALLENGES TO BE FACED IN TERMS OF RISK MANAGEMENT INCURRED FROM THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT IN ARAB COUNTRIES BECAUSE OF THIS TECHNOLOGICAL "" REVOLUTION"". © 2008 LAVOISIER, PARIS.

A NOVEL STOCHASTIC APPROACH FOR THE CALCULATION OF BS BLOCK-EDGE MASK (BEM) OUT-OF-BLOCK (OR BASELINE) LIMITS IS PRESENTED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT, FOR A TYPICAL BS IN-BLOCK EIRP OF 59 DBM/(10 MHZ) OR GREATER, THE FRACTION OF LOCATIONS IN WHICH A DTT RECEIVER WOULD SUFFER UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF INTERFERENCE DOES NOT IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH A REDUCTION IN THE BS BEM BASELINE EIRP LIMIT BELOW 0 DBM/(8 MHZ). THIS IS DUE TO THE FINITE FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY OF THE DTT RECEIVERS. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT FOR IN-BLOCK EIRPS BELOW 59 DBM, THE BASELINE EIRP LIMIT SHOULD BE REDUCED PROPORTIONATELY IN ORDER FOR THE DTT LOCATION FAILURE RATE TO BE BROADLY INDEPENDENT OF THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK DEPLOYMENT GEOMETRY.","OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS (OFCOM), LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;AGENCE NATIONALE, DES FRÉQUENCES (ANFR), BREST, FRANCE;EUROPEAN BROADCASTING UNION (EBU), GENEVA, SWITZERLAND;EUROPEAN BROADCASTING UNION (EBU), GENEVA, SWITZERLAND","KARIMI, H.

A NOVEL STOCHASTIC APPROACH FOR THE CALCULATION OF BS BLOCK EDGE MASK (BEM) OUT-OF-BLOCK (BASELINE) LIMITS IS PRESENTED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT, FOR A TYPICAL BS IN-BLOCK EIRP OF 59 DBM/(10 MHZ) OR GREATER, THE FRACTION OF LOCATIONS IN WHICH A DTT RECEIVER WOULD SUFFER UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF INTERFERENCE DOES NOT IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH A REDUCTION IN THE BS BEM BASELINE EIRP LIMIT BELOW 0 DBM/(8 MHZ). THIS IS DUE TO THE FINITE FREQUENCY SELECTIVITY OF THE DTT RECEIVERS. IT IS ALSO SHOWN THAT FOR IN-BLOCK EIRPS BELOW 59 DBM, THE BASELINE EIRP LIMIT SHOULD BE REDUCED PROPORTIONATELY IN ORDER FOR THE DTT LOCATION FAILURE RATE TO BE BROADLY INDEPENDENT OF THE COMMUNICATION NETWORK DEPLOYMENT GEOMETRY.

WE FIRST DEFINE SEVERAL STAGES OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS, WHICH WE CHARACTERIZE BY MEANS OF CONTINGENCY TABLES OR CROSS TABULATIONS. ONE OF OUR FIRST FINDINGS IS THAT MOST COUNTRIES FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATH OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT, AND ONE THAT HAS A STRONG CORRELATION WITH SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: HIGHER LEVELS OF WEALTH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, EDUCATION AND THE EXISTENCE OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURES ALMOST ALWAYS COINCIDE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER, WE ALSO FIND OUTLYING ECONOMIES THAT FOLLOW THEIR OWN DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT STRUCTURE: LEAPFROGGERS. WE THEN PERFORM BINOMIAL LOGISTIC ANALYSIS TO FIND OUT THE REASONS OF BEING A DIGITAL LEADER OR LAGGARD. BESIDES THE USUAL SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS CAUSING HIGHER OR LOWER DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT LEVELS, WE ALSO FIND THAT GOVERNMENTS CAN ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF PUBLIC POLICIES THAT FRAME AND FOSTER THE INFORMATION SOCIETY - SUCH AS GOVERNMENT PRIORITIZATION OF ICT AND ASSIGNING A HIGH IMPORTANCE TO ICT IN GOVERNMENT VISION OF THE FUTURE - AND ESTABLISHING AN APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC INCENTIVE REGIME.

HERB U,"SOCIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING: OPEN ACCESS, SCIENCE, SOCIETY, DEMOCRACY, AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE",FIRST MONDAY,FIRST MONDAY,ARTICLE,NA,NA,"CLAIMS FOR OPEN ACCESS ARE MOSTLY UNDERPINNED WITH A. SCIENCE-RELATED ARGUMENTS (OPEN ACCESS ACCELERATES SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION); B. FINANCIAL ARGUMENTS (OPEN ACCESS RELIEVES THE SERIALS CRISIS); C. SOCIAL ARGUMENTS (OPEN ACCESS REDUCES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE); D. DEMOCRACY-RELATED ARGUMENTS (OPEN ACCESS FACILITATES PARTICIPATION); AND, E. SOCIO-POLITICAL ARGUMENTS (OPEN ACCESS LEVELS DISPARITIES). USING SOCIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS AND NOTIONS, THIS ARTICLE FOCUSES STRONGLY ON PIERRE BOURDIEU'S THEORY OF (SCIENTIFIC) CAPITAL AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN ACCESS, MICHEL FOUCAULT'S DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF OPEN ACCESS FOR THE CONCEPT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. BOURDIEU'S THEORY OF CAPITAL IMPLIES THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN ACCESS DEPENDS ON THE LOGIC OF POWER AND THE ACCUMULATION OF SCIENTIFIC CAPITAL. IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON SLOGANS DERIVED FROM HAGIOGRAPHIC SELF-PERCEPTIONS OF SCIENCE (E.G., THE ACCELERATION OF SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION) AND SCIENTISTS (E.G., THEIR WILL TO SHARE THEIR INFORMATION FREELY). ACCORDING TO BOURDIEU'S THEORY, IT IS CRUCIAL FOR OPEN ACCESS (AND ASSOCIATED CONCEPTS LIKE ALTERNATIVE IMPACT METRICS) TO UNDERSTAND HOW SCIENTISTS PERCEIVE ITS POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON EXISTING PROCESSES OF CAPITAL ACCUMULATION AND HOW OPEN ACCESS WILL AFFECT THEIR DEMAND FOR STATUS. FOUCAULT'S DISCOURSE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT OPEN ACCESS MAY INTENSIFY DISPARITIES, SCIENTOCENTRISM AND ETHNOCENTRISM. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CONCEPTS FROM THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCES (POPPER, KUHN, FEYERABEND) AND THEIR IMPLICIT CONNECTION TO THE CONCEPT OF OPEN ACCESS ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER.","SAARLAND UNIVERSITY STATE LIBRARY, GERMANY","HERB, U.; SAARLAND UNIVERSITY STATE LIBRARYGERMANY; EMAIL: U.HERB@SULB.UNI-SAARLAND.DE","BJÖRK B, 2004; BOURDIEU P, 2002; BOURDIEU P, 1998; BOURDIEU P, 1997; BRAUN T, 2005; DONG P, 2005, DOI 10.1186/1742-5581-2-7; FEYERABEND P, 1975; FOUCAULT M, 1972; FRÖHLICH G, 1998; FRÖHLICH G, 1996; FRÖHLICH G, 1995; HABERMAS J, 1984; HAIDER J, 2007, DOI 10.1108/00012530710817636; HAIDER J, 2006; HAIDER J, 2005; HAIDER J, 2006, DOI 10.1108/03074800610702570; HESS T, 2007; KILEY R, 2006; KUHN T, 1970; PACKER A, 2007; PAPIN-RAMCHARAN J, 2006, DOI 10.5210/fm.v11i6.1332; POPPER K, 1992; SWAN A, 2005",16,2010,NA,2-S2.0-77953552923,SCOPUS,SAARLAND UNIVERSITY STATE LIBRARY,NOTREPORTED;SAARLAND UNIVERSITY STATE LIBRARYGERMANY;NOTREPORTED,NA,"HERB U, 2010, FIRST MONDAY","HERB U, 2010, FIRST MONDAY",GERMANY,10.5210/fm.v15i2.2599,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-77953552923&DOI=10.5210%2FFM.V15I2.2599&PARTNERID=40&MD5=B0A9C9533DC38C52E46017F0323F553B,NA,NA,FIRST MONDAY,NA,SCO

IT IS BASED ON A PAPER PRESENTED AT THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INFORMATION SOCIETY E-SOCIETY CONFERENCE, 10-13 MARCH 2011, SPAIN (PARYCEK ET AL., 2011). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – THE INTERPRETATION FOLLOWS THE RESULTS OF A STUDY CONDUCTED IN 2009 AND 2010 IN SCHOOL COMPUTER LABS. THE STUDY DESIGN INCLUDES AN ONLINE SURVEY, A QUESTIONNAIRE AND A CLOZE TEST. FINDINGS – THE RESULTS GIVE EVIDENCE THAT A DIGITAL DIVIDE IN AUSTRIA EXISTS EVEN AMONG TEENAGERS, IN PARTICULAR IN RELATION TO GENDER, SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS AND SCHOOL TYPE. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – AS THE SURVEY WAS DONE WITH 14-YEAR-OLD PUPILS, THE RESULTS ARE LIMITED TO THIS AGE GROUP. HOWEVER, THE TARGET GROUP ENABLES RESEARCHERS TO RELATE THE RESULTS TO THE MAIN TWO SCHOOL TYPES IN AUSTRIA, AS PUPILS ATTEND EITHER OF THESE SCHOOLS AT THIS AGE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – THE FINDINGS OF THE SURVEY WERE COMMUNICATED TO THE FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR EDUCATION, ARTS AND CULTURE OF AUSTRIA.

THE FAIRLY LARGE AMOUNT OF SPECTRUM THAT WILL BE FREED UP IN THE ANALOG TV SWITCH-OFF IS KNOWN AS THE DIGITAL DIVIDEND. MANY EU COUNTRIES HAVE DECIDED TO PARTIALLY ALLOCATE THESE FREQUENCIES, THROUGH MARKET MECHANISMS, TO MOBILE USE, BUT A LARGE FRACTION OF THE DIVIDEND IS SUPPOSED TO REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF BROADCASTERS. AN EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT OF THE SPECTRUM REQUIRES THAT THE USE OF THIS RESOURCE SHOULD BE SUPPORTED THROUGH APPROPRIATE INCENTIVE POLICIES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A TECHNO-ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO EVALUATE THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF USING A SPECTRUM PORTION WITHIN THE DIGITAL DIVIDENDS' BANDWIDTHS, FOR EXAMPLE AROUND 800900 MHZ, FOR BOTH DVB-T AND UMTS SERVICES, SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THE EXTRAORDINARY RISE IN THE USE OF MOBILE BROADBAND IN THE EUROPEAN CONTEXT.

ON THE AFRICAN CONTINENT IN PARTICULAR, THIS DIVISION HAS RESULTED IN A GAP BETWEEN THE KNOWLEDGE GENERATION AND ITS TRANSFORMATION INTO TANGIBLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS PAPER PROPOSES SOME FUNDAMENTAL APPROACHES FOR A SUSTAINABLE TRANSFORMATION OF DATA INTO KNOWLEDGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPROVING THE PEOPLE'S QUALITY OF LIFE. ITS MAIN STRATEGY IS BASED ON A GENERIC DATA SHARING MODEL PROVIDING ACCESS TO DATA UTILISING AND GENERATING ENTITIES IN A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY ENVIRONMENT. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE GREAT POTENTIALS IN USING UNSUPERVISED AND SUPERVISED MODELLING IN TACKLING THE TYPICALLY PREDICTIVE-IN-NATURE CHALLENGES WE FACE. USING BOTH SIMULATED AND REAL DATA, THE PAPER DEMONSTRATES HOW SOME OF THE KEY PARAMETERS MAY BE GENERATED AND EMBEDDED IN MODELS TO ENHANCE THEIR PREDICTIVE POWER AND RELIABILITY.

SPECTRUM POLICY IS PARAMOUNT AS SPECTRUM IS A SCARCE RESOURCE ALLOCATED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES. HENCE, WHEN ALLOCATING SPECTRUM AND DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL USE OF SPECTRUM, THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION IN MOBILE MARKETS. MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, ESPECIALLY THE GROWING MOBILE BROADBAND AND MOBILE DATA BUSINESS, USE DIFFERENT SPECTRUM BANDS (TYPICALLY 800 MHZ, 900 MHZ, 1800 MHZ, 2100 MHZ AND 2600 MHZ). THE PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DIFFERENT BANDS VARY; THIS HAS AN IMPACT NOT ONLY ON COSTS FOR NETWORK ROLLOUT BUT ALSO ON THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE SPECTRUM, WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN THE PRICES ACHIEVED IN ALLOCATION PROCEEDINGS SUCH AS AUCTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, THE IMPACT OF SPECTRUM ALLOCATION ON THE NETWORK COST IS ANALYZED. THE ACCESS NETWORK COSTS ARE CONSIDERED BASED ON DIFFERENT SPECTRUM ALLOCATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND COMPARED TO THE ACQUISITION COSTS OF SPECTRUM. BASED ON ECONOMIC MODELING AND PREVIOUS RESEARCH, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPECTRUM BELOW 1 GHZ AND ABOVE 1 GHZ ARE CONSIDERABLE. AS LONG AS THESE DIFFERENCES ARE REFLECTED IN THE PRICES, NO OUTCOMES ON COMPETITION EXIST. AS SPECTRUM THOUGH IS ALLOCATED AND ADMINISTERED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, THIS IS NOT ON ALWAYS THE CASE, WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO DISTORTED COMPETITION. HENCE, THE FINDING OF THE STUDY IS THAT THE PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPECTRUM IS A FACTOR TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN ALLOCATING SPECTRUM DUE TO ITS EFFECT ON NETWORK COSTS AND HENCE, EVENTUALLY COMPETITION PROBLEMS DUE TO ASYMMETRIC ALLOCATION. © 2012 ELSEVIER LTD.

MOHAMED NOUR S,OVERVIEW OF THE USE OF ICT AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SUDAN,CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMICS,CONTR. ECON.,ARTICLE,NA,COMPUTER; EDUCATION; INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; LITERACY; MOBILE COMMUNICATION; RURAL AREA; URBAN AREA; URBANIZATION; SUDAN,"THIS CHAPTER PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE USE OF ICT AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SUDAN AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO ENHANCE EQUALITY IN THE USE OF ICT IN SUDAN. OUR FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FINDINGS IN THE INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE ON THE INCIDENCE AND THE MAIN REASONS FOR THE INCIDENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION AND FILL THE GAP IN THE SUDANESE LITERATURE, A NOVEL ELEMENT IN OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE SUDANESE LITERATURE WE USE RECENT SECONDARY DATA AT THE MACRO LEVEL TO DISCUSS THE USE OF ICT AND THE INCIDENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SUDAN AND WE PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS BY INVESTIGATING AND COMPARING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR DIFFERENT MODES OF ICT IN SUDAN. OUR RESULTS CONFIRM THE SEVENTH HYPOTHESIS IN CHAP. 1 ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USES OF ICT (MOBILE, COMPUTER AND INTERNET) AND THE OCCURRENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS IN TERMS OF OWNERSHIP, USE, SPENDING, AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE AND PURPOSES OF USES OF MOBILE, COMPUTER AND INTERNET DEFINED BY REGION (GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION), MODE OF LIVING, GENDER, AGE AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL IN SUDAN. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT THE OBSERVED DISPARITIES IN THE USE OF ICT AND DIGITAL DIVIDE IMPLIES THAT ICT ADDS A NEW DIMENSION TO THE ALREADY EXISTING AND LONGSTANDING CHALLENGES OF INEQUALITIES AND DISPARITIES IN SUDAN THAT HAS BEEN WELL-DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE AS WE EXPLAINED IN CHAP. 2. WE FIND THAT THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT FACTORS THAT HINDERED THE USE OF COMPUTER AT HOME AND THE USE OF INTERNET ARE THE LACK OF ELECTRICITY THAT HINDERED THE USE OF COMPUTER AND THE NON AVAILABILITY OF THE INTERNET SERVICE THAT HINDERED THE USE OF THE INTERNET IN RURAL AREAS NEARLY TWICE HIGHER THAN IN URBAN AREAS. WE FIND THAT HOME IS THE MOST COMMONLY PLACE FOR USING THE INTERNET, ARABIC IS THE MOST WIDELY USED LANGUAGE FOR USING THE INTERNET AND MOBILE CELLULAR TELEPHONE IS THE MOST WIDELY USED MEAN OR FOR USING THE INTERNET. THE USE OF MOBILE CELLULAR TELEPHONE IS MORE THAN 14 TIMES HIGHER THAN FIXED TELEPHONE. WE FIND POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USE OF COMPUTER AND INTERNET AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AND NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USE OF COMPUTER, INTERNET AND MOBILE AND AGE. OUR FINDINGS IMPLY INCONCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE USE OF MOBILE AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND BETWEEN THE USE OF COMPUTER, MOBILE AND INTERNET AND PROFESSIONAL LEVELS. WE FIND POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE USE OF ICT AND NET ENROLMENT RATE IN PRIMARY EDUCATION, LITERACY RATE, PER CAPITA INCOME AND RATE OF URBANIZATION AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE USE OF ICT AND POVERTY GAP RATIO. OUR RESULTS IN THIS CHAPTER CONFIRMS THE SEVENTH HYPOTHESIS IN CHAP. 1 ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE USE OF ICT AND THE INCIDENCE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE DEFINED BY AGE AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL IN SUDAN.

TIME USE RES.,ARTICLE,INTERNET USE; LEISURE; TIME ALLOCATION,NA,"THIS PAPER EXAMINES WHETHER THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET IN GENERAL AND OF SPECIFIC WEBSITES (LEISURE, IMPROVING HUMAN CAPITAL AND OBTAINING GOODS AND SERVICES). IT USES A UNIQUE DATASET WHICH COVERS THE ENTIRE CLICKSTREAM OF ALMOST 20,000 INTERNET USERS IN THE FIVE LARGEST EU ECONOMIES DURING 2011. OUR MAIN FINDING IS THAT, FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, THE INCOME-BASED DIGITAL DIVIDE IN INTERNET USE AT HOME HAS BEEN REVERSED. LOW-INCOME INTERNET USERS SPEND MORE TIME ON THE INTERNET AT HOME THAN HIGH-INCOME USERS ON ALL TYPES OF WEBSITES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF AN EDUCATION-BASED DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE USE OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND GOODS & SERVICES WEBSITES. TERTIARY EDUCATION HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TIME SPENT ON LEISURE WEBSITES AND A POSITIVE EFFECT ON TIME SPENT ON HUMAN CAPITAL AND GOODS & SERVICES WEBSITES. USING QUANTILE REGRESSIONS, WE FIND THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF INCOME AND THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF EDUCATION FOR HUMAN CAPITAL AND GOODS & SERVICES WEBSITES HOLD FOR THE ENTIRE CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THESE ONLINE ACTIVITIES. MOREOVER, THESE EFFECTS ARE STRONGER FOR MORE INTENSIVE INTERNET USERS.

IN EUROPE, ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF THE POPULATION IS NOW REGULARLY USING THE INTERNET. BUT THE PUSH TOWARDS AN INFORMATION SOCIETY ALSO HAS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PARTAKE IN IT FALL FURTHER BEHIND IN THAT THEY CANNOT UTILIZE ONLINE SERVICES. BRIDGING DIGITAL DIVIDES IS THEREFORE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN CREATING AN INCLUSIVE SOCIETY AND TO REAP THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS THEREOF. THIS IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FOR INSTANCE, DESPITE PROGRESS MADE IN THE SUPPLY OF PUBLIC SECTOR INFORMATION AND SERVICES ONLY 10% OF EUROPE'S GOVERNMENT WEBSITES ARE FULLY ACCESSIBLE TODAY, ACCORDING TO A STUDY CARRIED OUT FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC).

MOOC, ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT HAVE EMERGED FROM THE COMBINATION OF E-LEARNING COURSES AND SOCIAL NETWORKS MODELS, HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO MANY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMES. SINCE MOOC ARE A RELATIVELY NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGY, THIS PAPER IS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE ITS CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FROM THE REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND THE STATISTICS SHOWN FOR MAJOR PLATFORMS. IN LINE WITH THE LITERATURE, FOUR FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED AND MEASURED, NAMELY, EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE DESIGN, DROPOUT RATES, UNIVERSAL SCOPE, AND BUSINESS STRATEGY. A SAMPLE OF 35 MOOC PLATFORMS WITH MORE THAN 7000 COURSES WAS USED TO REVIEW THE PROPOSED ANALYTICAL FACTORS. THE TWO AREAS THAT APPEAR TO BE MOST CRITICAL ARE LOW INTERACTIVITY AND A BUSINESS STRATEGY DESIGNED WITHOUT ADEQUATE PARTICIPATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL COMMUNITY.","DEPARTAMENTO DE DIDÁCTICA GENERAL, ESPECÍFICA Y TEORÍA DE LA EDUCACIÓN, UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN, CAMPUS DE VEGAZANA, S/N, LEÓN, 24071, SPAIN;DEPARTAMENTO DE DOCUMENTACIÓN, UNIVERSIDAD PAUL VALÉRY MONTPELLIER 3, ROUTE DE MENDE, MONTPELLIER CEDEX 5, 34199, FRANCE",NA,"AVILA P, 2001; BRESLOW L, 2013; BROWN J, 1989, DOI 10.3102/0013189x018001032; BROWN J, 2008; CARON P, 2013; CHEN Y, 2007; CROSS S, 2013; DERYCKE A, 2013; DZIORNY M, 2007; ESPOSITO A, 2012; FENN J, 2007; FREITAS S, 2007; GARCÍA A, 2002; GROS B, 2002; KHALIL H, 2013; KIZILCEC R, 2013; KOHLER F, 2013; KOP R, 2008, DOI 10.19173/irrodl.v9i3.523; KOP R, 2011, DOI 10.19173/irrodl.v12i3.882; KRICHEN J, 2007, DOI 10.1145/1324302.1324330; MAK S, 2010; MCAULEY A, 2010; MCLELLAN H, 1997; NORVIG P, 2012; PARR C, 2013; PRENSKY M, 2010; TEPLECHUK E, 2013",32,2014,NA,2-S2.0-85034754449,SCOPUS,UNIVERSIDAD DE LEÓN;,NOTREPORTED,NA,"POY R, 2014, REV IBERICA SIST TECNOL INF","POY R, 2014, REV IBERICA SIST TECNOL INF",FRANCE;SPAIN,10.4304/risti.e1.105-118,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85034754449&DOI=10.4304%2FRISTI.E1.105-118&PARTNERID=40&MD5=C662450746FEFBC09A5D8B36FDF00CCD,NA,NA,ASSOCIACAO IBERICA DE SISTEMAS E TECNOLOGIAS DE INFORMACAO,NA,SCO

ELDER VOLUNTEERS TENDED TO USE DFBNET MORE OFTEN THAN YOUNGER VOLUNTEERS. THE TIME SPENT ON VOLUNTEER WORK CORRELATES POSITIVELY WITH THE INTENSITY OF USING DFBNET. THIS CORRELATION CONTINUES TO HOLD WHEN THE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF OTHER CONTROL VARIABLES IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.IMPLICATIONS: THE RESULTS ARE USEFUL FOR SPORTS ASSOCIATIONS AND SPORTS CLUBS TO DEVELOP INTERNET-BASED TOOLS THAT HELP TO STRUCTURE THE COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR VOLUNTEERS. THE RESULTS INFORM ABOUT WHICH GROUPS OF VOLUNTEER WORKERS USE INTERNET-BASED TOOLS, TO WHAT EXTENT THEY USE THEM, AND WHAT CONNECTION EXISTS BETWEEN INTERNET USE AND THE LENGTH OF TIME SPENT ON VOLUNTEER WORK. © 2014 © 2014 EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION FOR SPORT MANAGEMENT.","ECONOMICS OF SPORT, INSTITUTE FOR SPORT SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF SAARLAND, SAARBRÜCKEN 66041, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, HELMUT SCHMIDT UNIVERSITY, HAMBURG 22043, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, HELMUT SCHMIDT UNIVERSITY, HAMBURG 22043, GERMANY","EMRICH, E.; ECONOMICS OF SPORT, INSTITUTE FOR SPORT SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF SAARLAND, SAARBRÜCKEN 66041, GERMANY; EMAIL: E.EMRICH@MX.UNI-SAARLAND.DE","ALLMANN B, 2004; BAUERNSCHUSTER S, 2010; BREUER C, 2011; BREUER C, 2009; BUCY E, 2000, DOI 10.1162/108118000568967; COLEMAN J, 1988; CONEUS K, 2010; CZAJKA S, 2010; CZERNICH N, 2011; DAUGS R, 2005; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DIMAGGIO P, 2001; EMRICH E, 2013; EMRICH E, 2001; FAIRLIE R, 2004, DOI 10.2202/1538-0645.1263; FLATAU J, 2012; FRANZEN A, 2003, DOI 10.1046/j.0023-5962.2003.00224.x; GEHRKE B, 2008; GERHARDS M, 2004; GOLDFARB A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2007.05.001; GRAJCZYK A, 2001; GRANOVETTER M, 1973; GREENE W, 2003; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HUNGERFORD H, 2010; KIRCHMAIR R, 2006; KORUPP S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/esr/jci030; KRAUT R, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1540-4560.00248; KRINGS B, 2006; KROSS E, 2013; KUBICEK H, 2003; LIEBOWITZ S, 2011; MIDDLETON C, 2010; NÄSI M, 2012, DOI 10.1007/s10433-011-0210-8; ONO H, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.t01-1-8401007; ONO H, 2005, DOI 10.1525/sop.2005.48.1.105; PÉNARD T, 2010, DOI 10.2753/jei0021-3624440301; RULLANG C, NA; SABATINI F, 2013; SCHLEIFE K, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2009.11.003; SHAH D, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004005; STADELHOFER C, 2000, DOI 10.1007/s003910070059; STEINFELD C, 2008; VALENZUELA S, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01474.x; VAN EIMEREN B, 2011",8,2014,NA,2-S2.0-84902789794,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF SAARLAND;HELMUT SCHMIDT UNIVERSITY;HELMUT SCHMIDT UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF SAARLAND;NOTREPORTED,NA,"EMRICH E, 2014, EUR SPORT MANAGE Q","EMRICH E, 2014, EUR SPORT MANAGE Q",GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY,10.1080/16184742.2014.897737,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-84902789794&DOI=10.1080%2F16184742.2014.897737&PARTNERID=40&MD5=55AB035CDCB980DEDC14FBA04BEA67EC,NA,NA,ROUTLEDGE,NA,SCO

IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE BARRIERS TO SOCIAL AND LABOR EXCLUSION IT WAS ELABORATED A SURVEY RELATING WITH THE USE AND IMPACT OF ITC IN SOCIAL AND LABOR EXPERIENCES OF RURAL WOMEN. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT RURAL WOMEN ARE AWARE OF THE KEY ROLE PLAYED FOR ITC ON THEIR WAY TO ACHIEVE THE PARTICIPATION ON DECISION MAKING PROCESS AS WELL AS IN SOCIAL LIFE AND LABOR. THE MAIN BARRIERS TO THE INTERNET PENETRATION IN WOMEN SOCIAL LIFE WERE EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND INCOME. FROM AN INDIVIDUAL POINT OF VIEW, THE EXISTENCE OF NON-USERS WAS EXPLAINED BY A COMBINATION OF ACCESS PROBLEMS, LACK OF ICT SKILLS OR RATHER NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS ITC.

INF. COMMUN. ETHICS SOC.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE(S); INEQUALITIES; INFORMATION SOCIETY,NA,"PURPOSE – THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO CREATE A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, BASED ON A STRUCTURED LITERATURE REVIEW, TO ANALYZE THE DIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE AND HELP FIND SOLUTIONS FOR IT.ADIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE EXISTS BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRMENTS AND THOSE WITHOUT IMPAIRMENTS. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT IMPAIRMENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO OWN A COMPUTER OR HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION THAN ARE PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRMENTS. HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE IS SEEN IN RELATION NOT ONLY TO ACCESS BUT ALSO TO ACCESSIBILITY AND USE. FOR PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRMENTS, NEW TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS OFFER SOLUTIONS FOR EVERYDAY CHALLENGES, SUCH AS FINDING INFORMATION, COMMUNICATING WITH OTHERS AND USING ELECTRONIC SERVICES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – FOR THIS STUDY, 4,778 CONFERENCE AND JOURNAL PUBLICATIONS WERE SYSTEMATICALLY ANALYZED. FINDINGS – A NUMBER OF KEY FINDINGS EMERGED. THIS FIELD IS RELATIVELY NEW, AND THE LITERATURE IS HIGHLY FOCUSED ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF THE DIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE, WITH TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETAL ATTRIBUTES BEING THE CORE SUB-ATTRIBUTES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL. THE PREVIOUS LITERATURE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY STUDY THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FINANCIAL SITUATION OF INDIVIDUALS; RATHER, THE PREDOMINANT FOCUS WAS ON THE HAVE-NOTS AND COUNTRIES WITH LOW INCOME POTENTIALS. FURTHERMORE, MOTIVATION REVEALS A COMPELLING CASE WITHIN THE DIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE SUBSET.

THIS IS EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THEIR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES AND THUS TO HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON THE DIGITAL OUTCOMES (OR SERVICES) EXPERIENCED. IN CONTRAST, THIS STUDY IS ANCHORED IN AN ALTERNATIVE SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC AND POSITS THAT VIEWING THE DIVIDE FROM A SERVICE PERSPECTIVE MIGHT BE BETTER SUITED TO THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WHERE THERE IS A HUGE DIVIDE ACROSS SOCIETAL SEGMENTS IN ACCESSING BASIC SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTHCARE AND EDUCATION. THIS RESEARCH VIEWS THE PREVAILING DIFFERENCES IN THE LEVEL OF SERVICES CONSUMED BY DIFFERENT POPULATION SEGMENTS (SERVICE DIVIDE) AS THE KEY ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED BY INNOVATIVE DIGITAL TOOLS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE STUDY POSITS THAT INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) CAN BE LEVERAGED TO BRIDGE THE SERVICE DIVIDE TO ENHANCE THE CAPABILITIES OF SERVICE-DISADVANTAGED SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY. BUT SUCH SERVICE DELIVERY REQUIRES AN INNOVATIVE ASSEMBLY OF ICT AS WELL AS NON-ICT RESOURCES. BUILDING ON CONCEPTS FROM SERVICE-DOMINANT LOGIC AND SERVICE SCIENCE, THIS PAPER AIMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SUCH SERVICE INNOVATION EFFORTS CAN BE ORCHESTRATED. SPECIFICALLY, ADOPTING A PROCESS VIEW, TWO INDIAN ENTERPRISES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED SUSTAINABLE TELEMEDICINE HEALTHCARE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS FOR THE RURAL POPULATION IN INDIA ARE EXAMINED. THE STUDY TRACES THE CONFIGURATIONS OF THREE INTERACTIONAL RESOURCES-KNOWLEDGE, TECHNOLOGY, AND INSTITUTIONS-THROUGH WHICH VALUE-CREATING USERCENTRIC OBJECTIVES OF INCREASING GEOGRAPHICAL ACCESS AND REDUCING COST ARE ACHIEVED. THE THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH UNEARTHING AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THE THREE INTERACTIONAL RESOURCES WERE ORCHESTRATED FOR SERVICE-CENTRIC VALUE CREATION IN DIFFERENT COMBINATIVE PATTERNS AS RESOURCE EXPLOITATION, RESOURCE COMBINATION, AND VALUE REINFORCEMENT. THE ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALS THE THREE DISTINCT STAGES OF SERVICE INNOVATION EVOLUTION (IDEA AND LAUNCH, INFANCY AND EARLY GROWTH, AND LATE GROWTH AND EXPANSION), WITH A DISTINCT SHIFT IN THE DOMINANT RESOURCE FOR EACH STAGE. THROUGH AN INDUCTIVE PROCESS, THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIES FOUR KEY ENABLERS FOR SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING THESE ICT-ENABLED SERVICE INNOVATIONS: OBSESSIVE CUSTOMER EMPATHY, BELIEF IN THE TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER OF ICT, CONTINUOUS RECURSIVE LEARNING, AND EFFICIENT NETWORK ORCHESTRATION.","DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HEC PARIS, 1 RUE DE LA LIBÉRATION, JOUY EN JOSAS CEDEX, 79351, FRANCE;DEPARTMENT OF MARKETING, INDIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT BANGALORE, BANNERGHATTA ROAD, BANGALORE, 560 076, INDIA",NA,"AGARWAL R, 2009, DOI 10.1287/isre.1080.0194; ARMSTRONG C, 1999, DOI 10.1287/isre.10.4.304; AVGEROU C, 2005, DOI 10.1007/0-387-25588-5_15; BAMBERGER P, 2008, DOI 10.5465/amj.2008.34789630; BARRETT M, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-09768-8_1; BRAA J, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148796; CHAKRABORTY S, 2010, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00225; CHING C, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0042085905276389; COLLIS D, 1995; COVA B, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2007.07.005; DE VRIES E, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2006.05.006; DEV C, 2005; DEWAN S, 2010, DOI 10.1287/isre.1080.0219; DEWAN S, 2005; DREZE J, 2013; DUTTA S, 2010; EISENHARDT K, 1989; ELLINGER A, 2002, DOI 10.1002/j.2158-1592.2002.tb00014.x; GALLAN A, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s11747-012-0307-4; GALLOUJ F, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0048-7333(97)00030-9; GOVINDRAJAN V, 2010; GEORGE G, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2012.01048.x; HSIEH J, 2008, DOI 10.2307/25148830; HSIEH J, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0256; JOHNS G, 2006, DOI 10.5465/amr.2006.20208687; KAUFFMAN R, 2005; KHANNA T, 1997; KHANNA T, 2010; KIRSCH L, 2004, DOI 10.1287/isre.1040.0036; KRISHNA S, 2003; KUMAR A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61884-3; LAMBKIN M, 1989; LEFF N, 1978; LIANG H, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148781; LYYTINEN K, 2008, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2008.50; MADON S, 2004; MADON S, 2005, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000576; MAGLIO P, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s11747-007-0058-9; MAIR J, 2007; MARKUS L, 1988; MISCIONE G, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148797; NEWMAN M, 1992, DOI 10.2307/249578; OBORN E, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1110.0372; ORDANINI A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1094670510385332; PARSONS A, 1991, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000002530; PATEL V, 2011, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(10)62044-2; PRAHALAD C, 2004; PURVIS R, 2001, DOI 10.1287/orsc.12.2.117.10115; RADJOU N, 2012; RADJOU N, 2012; RAI A, 2006, DOI 10.1287/isre.1060.0108; RANGAN V, 2009; REILLY K, 2001; SARKER S, 2012, DOI 10.2307/41410419; SEN A, 1985; SEN A, 1988, DOI 10.1016/s1573-4471(88)01004-6; SEN A, 1989; SHAH D, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1094670506294666; SHARMA R, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036548; SHETH J, 2000; SHETH J, 2000, DOI 10.1177/0092070300281006; SILVA L, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148794; SPENCE M, 1973, DOI 10.2307/1882010; SPOHRER J, 2008, DOI 10.3401/poms.1080.0027; SPOHRER J, 2007, DOI 10.1109/mc.2007.33; SRIVASTAVA S, 2013, DOI 10.1109/mitp.2013.102; TEO T, 2006; VARGO S, 2004, DOI 10.1509/jmkg.68.1.1.24036; VARGO S, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s11747-007-0069-6; VARGO S, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.emj.2008.04.003; VENKATESH V, 2013, DOI 10.1287/isre.1110.0409; VINEKAR A, 2011, DOI 10.1108/17554191111132215; WALSHAM G, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148793; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; YIN R, 1994; ZAHAY D, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.00117315.2004.02338.x; ZHU K, 2004, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2004.11045794",159,2015,NA,2-S2.0-84944892440,SCOPUS,DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;INDIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT BANGALORE,NOTREPORTED,NA,"SRIVASTAVA SC, 2015, MIS QUART MANAGE INF SYST","SRIVASTAVA SC, 2015, MIS QUART MANAGE INF SYST",FRANCE;INDIA,10.25300/misq/2015/39.1.11,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-84944892440&DOI=10.25300%2FMISQ%2F2015%2F39.1.11&PARTNERID=40&MD5=FE82FFE5104C40AC5F9CD5130242BA51,NA,NA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,NA,SCO

ANN.,ARTICLE,BROADBAND; COMPETIVENESS; DIGITAL DIVIDE; ECONOMIC GROWTH,NA,"THE EXISTING VARIATION IN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE BETWEEN COUNTRIES IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL, DIFFUSION, AND USE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS INCREASINGLY DEPENDS ON BROADBAND AVAILABILITY AND THE ADOPTION, USE, AND SPEED OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. BROADBAND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET FOSTERS ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASES A COUNTRY'S GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES BECAUSE THEY CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE A LARGE DIGITAL DIVIDE, BOTH WITHIN COUNTRIES (BETWEEN REGIONS, URBAN AND RURAL AREAS, DIFFERENT VULNERABLE GROUPS, ETC.) AND WITH EU COUNTRIES. THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO ANALYSE THE CURRENT LEVEL AND DYNAMICS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES USING THE BROADBAND ACHIEVEMENT INDEX (BAI), THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA)-BASED MODEL, THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS INDEX (GCI), THE CORRUPTION PERCEPTION INDEX (CPI), AND CROSS-COUNTRY METHODOLOGY. THIS PAPER MEASURES AND COMPARES WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES' CURRENT LEVEL OF BROADBAND ADOPTION AND THEIR POSITION ON THE EVOLUTIONARY PATH TOWARDS CLOSING THE EXISTING ECONOMIC AND DIGITAL GAP WITH EU COUNTRIES. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CALCULATED BAI DATA VALUES, GCI, AND CPI SHOWS THAT WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES BELONG TO THE 'LAGGARD' GROUP REGARDING THEIR BROADBAND ACHIEVEMENT AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. THE VALUES OF THE CALCULATED BAI SUB-INDEXES IN THIS PAPER INDICATE THE STRONG AND WEAK SIDES OF THE CORRESPONDING ASPECTS OF BROADBAND TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION AND GIVE DIRECTIONS FOR SETTING FURTHER PRIORITIES FOR POLITICAL INTERVENTION, NOT ONLY IN THE BUILDING OF INFORMATION SOCIETY BUT ALSO IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS OF WESTERN BALKAN COUNTRIES.","UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE, FACULTY OF ECONOMICS, SERBIA","MITROVIĆ, D.; UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE, SERBIA; EMAIL: DJORDJEM@EKOF.BG.AC.RS","BADASYAN N, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.09.004; BERTSCHEK I, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2012.11.002; CHERCHYE L, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s11205-006-9029-7; CHERCHYE L, 2008; CLARK M, 2003; COLOMBO M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2012.11.001; CZERNICH N, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2011.02420.x; FABRITZ N, 2013; FUSCO E, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ejor.2014.10.017; GOLANY B, 1989, DOI 10.1016/0305-0483(89)90029-7; GRUBER H, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.06.007; HATEFI S, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.08.014; HOWARD P, 2009, DOI 10.1080/01972240902848948; HÜSING T, 2004; JUNG J, 2014; KOLKO J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jue.2011.07.004; KONGAUT C, 2014; KOUTROUMPIS P, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.07.004; MITROVIC D, 2012; PIATKOWSKI M, 2002; QIANG C, 2009; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; VIDOLI F, 2013; ZHOU P, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.10.018; ZHOU P, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.12.020; WHITACRE B, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.05.005",10,2015,NA,2-S2.0-84959545761,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE,NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE;NOTREPORTED,NA,"MITROVIĆ D, 2015, ECON ANN","MITROVIĆ D, 2015, ECON ANN",SERBIA,10.2298/eka1507095m,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-84959545761&DOI=10.2298%2FEKA1507095M&PARTNERID=40&MD5=0730854ABA471C83F55B3A6ACAB457EB,NA,NA,UNIVERSITY OF BELGRADE,NA,SCO

A PAPER-BASED SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH TEACHERS AND HEAD-TEACHERS FROM RANDOMLY SAMPLED 17 BASIC SCHOOLS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN GHANA. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADOPTED FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR CAPACITY BUILDING – UNESCO AND EU RUBRICS FOR MEASURING ICT IN EDUCATION; AND EXPLORED NINE DIGITAL CULTURE COMPONENTS INCLUDING TDL. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING K-MEANS CLUSTERING, CORRELATION ANALYSIS, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS, AND INDEPENDENT-SAMPLES T-TEST. THE SCHOOLS WERE CLUSTERED BASED ON SDC COMPONENTS INTO TWO DD GROUPS; THE PRINCIPAL INFLUENCING FACTORS WERE TEACHERS’ DIGITAL LITERACY AND ICT RELATED POLICY DOCUMENTS. THE SCHOOL GROUPS PARTICULARLY DIFFERED BASED ON WHETHER THEY NOT ONLY HAD THE DIGITAL LITERACY COMPETENCES, BUT ALSO APPLIED THESE COMPETENCES IN THEIR TEACHING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN SCHOOLS. WE ARGUE THAT IN SPITE OF TRAINING FOR TDL, MANY SCHOOLS STILL LACK OTHER DIGITAL CULTURE COMPONENTS, AND THIS MAY HINDER THEM IN APPLYING ICT IN THEIR SCHOOLS. © SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND 2015.","SCHOOL OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, TALLINN UNIVERSITY, CET NARVA MNT 29, TALLINN, 10120, ESTONIA;SCHOOL OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, TALLINN UNIVERSITY, CET NARVA MNT 29, TALLINN, 10120, ESTONIA","QUAICOE, J.S.; SCHOOL OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, CET NARVA MNT 29, ESTONIA; EMAIL: PAASANNI@TLU.EE","FU J, 2013; MURRAY M, 2014; MARKAUSKAITE L, 2006; GALLARDO-ECHENIQUE E, 2015; CORDELL R, 2013, DOI 10.15760/comminfolit.2013.7.2.150; TONDEUR J, 2009, DOI 10.1080/03055690902804349; FYKSEN S, 2011; QUAICOE J, 2015, DOI 10.1109/istafrica.2015.7190518; ENGEN B, 2009; AL-ZAIDIYEEN N, 2010; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; VAN DIJK J, 2008; VAN DIJK J, 2012, DOI 10.3233/978-1-61499-057-4-57; MNDZEBELE N, 2013; GUDMUNDSDOTTIR G, 2010; AMENYEDZI W, 2011; ACQUAH B, 2012; BOADU G, 2014; BOAKYE K, 2008; MCKENNEY S, 2013, DOI 10.3402/rlt.v21i0.17374",7,2015,NA,2-S2.0-84955296571,SCOPUS,TALLINN UNIVERSITY;TALLINN UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;SCHOOL OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES;NOTREPORTED,NA,"QUAICOE JS, 2015, COMMUN COMPUT INFO SCI","QUAICOE JS, 2015, COMMUN COMPUT INFO SCI",ESTONIA;ESTONIA,10.1007/978-3-319-28197-1_16,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-84955296571&DOI=10.1007%2F978-3-319-28197-1_16&PARTNERID=40&MD5=73FA7FF7F26C8F202F661887A62AD283,NA,NA,SPRINGER VERLAG,NA,SCO

IT DOES SO BY COMPARING THE EFFECT OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL STATUS (ESCS) ON THE DIGITAL SKILLS OF CHILEAN STUDENTS COMPARED WITH MATHEMATICS AND LANGUAGE. THIS COMPARISON IS MADE USING NATIONAL STANDARDIZED TESTS. THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF A GROUP OF VARIABLES MEASURING STUDENT ESCS WAS COMPARED BOTH AS A WHOLE AND SEPARATELY USING MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE MARGINAL EFFECT OF ESCS AS A WHOLE ON STUDENTS' DIGITAL SKILLS WAS EQUAL TO THE EFFECT ON MATHEMATICS AND GREATER THAN THE EFFECT ON LANGUAGE. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PARENTS' LEVEL OF EDUCATION WAS THE MOST RELEVANT FACTOR OF ESCS FOR EXPLAINING STUDENT PERFORMANCE ON THE DIGITAL TEST, MORE SO THAN FOR MATHEMATICS AND LANGUAGE. THESE FINDINGS CHALLENGE THE BELIEF THAT THE INTERNET WOULD REDUCE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INEQUALITIES IN NEW GENERATIONS. INSTEAD, THEY REVEAL THAT THE GAP AMONG CHILEAN STUDENTS TENDS TO PERPETUATE OR WIDEN WHEN COMPARING PERFORMANCE IN MATHEMATICS AND LANGUAGE WITH PERFORMANCE IN THE DIGITAL DOMAIN. AT THE SAME TIME, BY COMPARING NATIONAL TEST RESULTS, THIS PAPER OFFERS EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF A SECOND DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, A CONCEPT WHICH IS WIDELY DISCUSSED AT A THEORETICAL LEVEL BUT WITH LITTLE EMPIRICAL SUPPORT TO DATE. © 2014 ELSEVIER LTD.","CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND PRACTICE (CEPPE), PONTIFICIA UNIVERSIDAD CATÓLICA DE CHILE, CAMPUS SAN JOAQUÍN, AV.

A ROBUST MULTI-METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN PROVIDES FOR A LITERATUREDERIVED FRAMEWORK TO BE REFINED IN LIGHT OF OMAN-BASED CASE STUDIES AND PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH. FINDINGS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OF ENQUIRY INDICATE THAT STRONG INFLUENCERS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ACCEPTANCE FOR ARAB GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS AND CITIZENS ARE LEGISLATION AND BROADBAND AVAILABILITY. ON THE ORGANISATION SIDE, FINANCIAL, POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL. ON THE CITIZEN SIDE, DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES CONCERNING THE HIGH COST OF SERVICES AND LACK OF SOCIAL MEDIA AWARENESS AND SKILLS, PLUS TWO UNIQUELY ARAB CONCERNS (CRITICISM CULTURE AND DIALOGUE CULTURE) STRONGLY INFLUENCE CITIZEN ACCEPTANCE OF GOVERNMENT-LED SOCIAL MEDIA INITIATIVES.

AS SUCH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE AND PLACES THAT ARE LARGELY LEFT OUT OF DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY. THIS VISUALISATION LOOKS AT THESE IN TERMS OF INTERNET PENETRATION (I.E. THE SHARE OF THEIR POPULATION THAT HAVE “USED THE INTERNET (FROM ANY LOCATION) IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS” (SOURCE: UN 2015)). THE MAP HIGHLIGHTS ALL TERRITORIES THAT EITHER HAVE INTERNET PENETRATION BELOW 10%, OR FOR WHICH NO DATA FROM THE WORLD BANK EXISTS. A LACK OF DATA CAN EXIST FOR SEVERAL REASONS, FOR EXAMPLE: SOME OF THESE TERRITORIES ARE STATISTICALLY GROUPED TOGETHER WITH BIGGER ENTITIES, NO DATA HAVE BEEN COLLECTED OR INFERRED, OR THE TERRITORIES LACK WIDESPREAD RECOGNISED STATEHOOD. THE MAP ULTIMATELY HIGHLIGHTS AN ARCHIPELAGO OF LAND WHOSE POPULATION IS MOSTLY CUT OFF FROM THE INTERNET. THIS ARCHIPELAGO OF DISCONNECTION HAS ITS CENTRE OF GRAVITY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA WHERE 28 COUNTRIES HAVE INTERNET PENETRATION RATES BENEATH THE 10% THRESHOLD WE APPLIED.

WITH THE ADVANCE OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY, THE PHENOMENON OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY HAS RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION. THIS STUDY EXTENDED RESEARCH ON DIGITAL INEQUALITY TO THE FIELD OF MOBILE BUSINESS. THE PAPER AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN THE USE OF MOBILE BUSINESS SUPPORTING FEATURES IN CHINA. TO ADDRESS THIS, AN EMPIRICAL STUDY WITH 258 SUBJECTS WAS CARRIED OUT. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT PERCEIVED EASE OF USE HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE USE OF MOBILE BUSINESS SUPPORTING FEATURES, WHILE PERCEIVED RISK HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE USE OF MOBILE BUSINESS SUPPORTING FEATURES. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED BY PERCEIVED RISKS, WHILE SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE UTILITARIAN MOTIVATIONS. © SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING SWITZERLAND 2016.","DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, TRONDHEIM, NORWAY;SCHOOL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, ZHONGNAN UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS AND LAW, WUHAN, CHINA","GAO, S.; DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE, NORWAY; EMAIL: SHANGGAO@IDI.NTNU.NO","GAO S, 2015; BUHTZ K, 2014; DIMAGGIO P, 2004; DIMAGGIO P, 2001; KATZ J, 2002; HARGITTAI E, 2001; MOSSBERGER K, 2003; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; CHAUDHURI A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.07.001; RICE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5; JUNG J, 2001, DOI 10.1177/009365001028004006; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; GAO S, 2011, DOI 10.3233/mis-2011-0110; GAO S, 2014, DOI 10.3233/mis-130176; WU J, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2004.07.001; PAVLOU P, 2003, DOI 10.1080/10864415.2003.11044275; GAO S, 2011, DOI 10.1109/icmb.2011.31; GAO S, 2014; GAO S, 2014; HAUGSTVEDT A, 2012, DOI 10.1109/ismar.2012.6402563; ENGEL J, 1973; GEFEN D, 2000; GAO S, 2015; CHILDERS T, 2002; HSIEH J, 2008, DOI 10.2307/25148830; GAO S, 2010, DOI 10.1109/icmb-gmr.2010.51; FEATHERMAN M, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s1071-5819(03)00111-3; SCHECHTER L, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s11166-007-9017-6; MCLEOD J, 1990, DOI 10.2307/2137170; NORRIS P, 2001; ANESHENSEL C, 1992; KLINE P, 1993; IACOBUCCI D, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.jcps.2009.09.003; BENTLER P, 1992, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.400",0,2016,NA,2-S2.0-84962660849,SCOPUS,NORWEGIAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;ZHONGNAN UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS AND LAW,NOTREPORTED;DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCE;NOTREPORTED,NA,"GAO S, 2016, LECT NOTES INF SYS ORGAN","GAO S, 2016, LECT NOTES INF SYS ORGAN",CHINA;NORWAY,10.1007/978-3-319-30133-4_14,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-84962660849&DOI=10.1007%2F978-3-319-30133-4_14&PARTNERID=40&MD5=09A0D2521C0566FA5BE96F7B8B19BDE6,NA,NA,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,NA,SCO

AS A RESULT, NEW PUBLIC PARTICIPATION GIS METHODS FOR ENGAGING LARGE GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE EMERGED. ONE SUCH METHOD IS GEO-QUESTIONNAIRE, AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE WITH MAPPING CAPABILITIES, WHICH HAS BEEN USED TO ELICIT GEOGRAPHIC DATA IN VARIETY OF TOPICS AND GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEXTS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS TWO RECENT CASES, IN WHICH GEO-QUESTIONNAIRES HAVE BEEN USED IN POLISH CITIES TO OBTAIN PUBLIC INPUT ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND DEVELOPMENT PREFERENCES IN LOCAL LAND USE PLANNING.

IN BOTH CASES, THE USE OF THIS SPECTRUM COULD REDUCE THE ROLLOUT COSTS OF A RADIO ACCESS NETWORK (RAN) BASED ON LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) TECHNOLOGY. THE PERCEIVED VALUE OF 700 MHZ IS PRESENTED IN THIS ARTICLE AS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP (TCO) OF DEPLOYING THE NETWORK WITH AND WITHOUT THIS SPECTRUM. HOWEVER, THE ROLLOUT COSTS CAN DIFFER GREATLY AMONG MNOS IF THEY PREVIOUSLY HOLD DIFFERENT SPECTRUM PORTFOLIOS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE SUB-1 GHZ FREQUENCIES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY REVEAL THAT AN MNO NOT HOLDING THE ADDITIONAL 2×10 MHZ AT 800 MHZ, WOULD PERCEIVE 62% MORE VALUE OF 2×10 MHZ AT 700 MHZ, THAN AN MNO THAT DOES HOLD 2×10 MHZ AT 800 MHZ. IN ADDITION, THE VALUE OF THIS SPECTRUM COMES LARGELY FROM URBAN AREAS, WHERE NETWORKS ARE STRONGLY CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED.

BUT AS THE SUPPLY OF ONLINE SERVICE DELIVERY HAS IMPROVED, THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO USE THEM ALSO RISE. AS LEADING COUNTRIES ARE NOW PURSUING VARIOUS ""DIGITAL BY DEFAULT"" POLICIES, VULNERABLE SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION RISK FALLING FURTHER BEHIND IN ACCESSING SOCIO-ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. ACCESS TO ICTS REMAINS A KEY HURDLE TO E-GOVERNMENT USAGE AROUND THE WORLD AND THIS IS NOT ONLY A CHALLENGE TO EMERGING MARKETS. TO THE CONTRARY, IT IS PRECISELY IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES WHERE LARGE PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION IS MOVING ONLINE THAT THE RISK MAY BE GREATEST. DIGITAL DIVIDES THEREFORE POSE A THREAT TO BOTH SOCIAL INCLUSION BROADLY AND ELECTRONIC INCLUSION (E-INCLUSION) MORE SPECIFICALLY. A FORWARD-LOOKING FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO PRIORITIZE VARIOUS DIVIDES FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IS NEEDED.

IN THIS CONTEXT, TO UNDERSTAND BETTER THE ACTOR-TO-ACTOR CONNECTIONS, INTERACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIP NETWORKS, THIS STUDY RELIES ON A SYSTEMS THINKING PERSPECTIVE BY DEFINING THE OPENNESS DEGREE OF THE SYSTEMS AND THE GOVERNANCE OF THE COMMUNICATION FLOWS THAT DERIVE AS A CONSEQUENCE. THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH ADOPTED, ALBEIT OF A HEURISTIC TYPE, REFERS TO THE POSITIVE METHOD IN THAT, STARTING FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORICAL DESCRIPTIVE LITERATURE AND NON-FICTION, IT INTENDS TO FORMULATE VERY PRECISE FUTURE SCENARIOS. THE SYSTEMIC INTERPRETATION, IN THE LIGHT OF THE CONSTRUCTIVIST PARADIGM, ALLOWS US TO SUBVERT THE TRADITIONAL EXPLANATORY REPORT ‘OBJECT–INFORMATION–OBSERVER’, PLACING THE OBSERVATION FUNCTION AT THE BASE OF THE EXPLANATORY CHAIN: ‘OBSERVER–INFORMATION–OBJECT’. THE PROSPECT'S CHANGE IS RELEVANT BECAUSE EVERY PHENOMENON IN THE EYES OF THE OBSERVER IS A CONSTRUCT. THE PRESENT WORK SHEDS LIGHT ON THE BIRTH OF A NEW PRODUCTION MODE BASED ON COLLABORATIVE AND DECENTRALIZED MODELS, REFERRED TO AS ‘WEAPONS OF MASS COLLABORATION’. BASED ON THESE CHANGES, ENTERPRISE 2.0 DEVELOPS. THE USER–CONSUMER TAKES ON A NEW LOOK AND ACQUIRES AN ACTIVE, FLUID AND GROWING POWER. THIS REVEALS THAT INNOVATION CAN COME, AND INDEED DOES COME, FROM BELOW, FROM THE SAME SKILLED USERS WHO INCREASINGLY THIN THE LINE BETWEEN PROFESSIONALS AND AMATEURS. REGARDING SOME PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS, THIS STUDY SHOWS ORGANIZATIONS OF ANY TYPE THE BENEFITS OF THE NEW ECONOMIC PARADIGM, LEVERAGING THE PARTNERSHIP TO CUT COSTS AND ACCELERATING THE PACE OF INNOVATION. ANOTHER INFLUENTIAL IMPLICATION TO MACRO- AND MICRO-ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES IS THE TRANSITION FROM AN ECONOMY OF SCALE TO ONE OF FLEXIBILITY AND BREADTH.

AT THE SAME TIME, THERE EXISTS A DIGITAL DIVIDE AFFECTING VULNERABLE OR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS: STUDENTS OF FOREIGN ORIGIN AND STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS. IT IS NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY HOW INEQUALITY CAN BE OVERCOME TO REACH THE OBJECTIVES SET BY THE UNITED NATIONS REGARDING SUSTAINABLE FORMS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATION AND TO FOSTER MORE INCLUSIVE AND EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES. IN THIS RESEARCH WITH STUDENTS AGED 12-16, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ESTABLISH PROFILES ACCORDING TO GENDER, SOCIAL CLASS, ETHNIC BACKGROUND AND EDUCATIONAL SPECIAL NEEDS. WE USED A MIXED METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN, APPLYING A QUESTIONNAIRE TO 2734 STUDENTS FROM 15 CENTRES AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES. WE MADE A DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL ANALYSIS (SPSS PROGRAM) AND A QUALITATIVE DATA CONTENT ANALYSIS SUPPORTED BY THE ""MAXQDA"" PROGRAM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT, ALTHOUGH MOST STUDENTS HAVE INTERNET ACCESS, STUDENTS OF FOREIGN ORIGIN AND STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS USE THIS RESOURCE LESS FREQUENTLY. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR GENDER. LIKEWISE, SOCIAL DIVIDE HAS AN IMPACT ON THE LEARNING POTENTIAL OF THE INTERNET. SOME PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVEMENT ARE PROVIDED, FROM THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SCHOOL, WITH A VIEW TO IMPROVING SOCIO-EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION IN SOCIETIES IN SEARCH OF A MORE SUSTAINABLE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT. © 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.","DEPARTAMENTO DE DIDÁCTICA Y ORGANIZACIÓN ESCOLAR, FACULTAD DE EDUCACIÓN, UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA, CAMPUS DE ESPINARDO, MURCIA, 30100, SPAIN;DEPARTAMENTO DE DIDÁCTICA Y ORGANIZACIÓN ESCOLAR, FACULTAD DE EDUCACIÓN, UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA, CAMPUS DE ESPINARDO, MURCIA, 30100, SPAIN;DEPARTAMENTO DE DIDÁCTICA Y ORGANIZACIÓN ESCOLAR, FACULTAD DE EDUCACIÓN, UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA, CAMPUS DE ESPINARDO, MURCIA, 30100, SPAIN","PAGÁN, F.J.B.; DEPARTAMENTO DE DIDÁCTICA Y ORGANIZACIÓN ESCOLAR, SPAIN; EMAIL: PAGAN@UM.ES","PHILLIPPI A, 2011; ESCUDERO J, 2013; ESCUDERO J, 2013; GARCÍA J, 2015; ROS A, 2017; LOZANO J, 2015; ARRIAZU R, 2015; MARTÍN J, 2016; LEIVA J, 2010, DOI 10.1174/113564010790935240; COLÁS BRAVO M, 2013; PÉREZ G, 2013; NAVARRO J, 2006; HAßLER B, 2016, DOI 10.1111/jcal.12123; BIAGI F, 2013, DOI 10.1111/ejed.12016; PÉREZ ESCODA A, 2017; COLÁS P, 2018; LEUNG L, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0736-5853(02)00019-9; TUTEN T, 2014; COLÁS P, 2013; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; PRENSKY M, 2001; PRENSKY M, 2004; GÓMEZ P, 2014; BALLESTA J, 2008; GARRIDO-LORA M, 2016; LIVINGSTONE S, 2014; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/08838150802437396; LIVINGSTONE S, 2005; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808089415; LIVINGSTONE S, 2008; LIVINGSTONE S, 2012; GARMENDIA M, 2016; SABATER C, 2015; ALONSO-RUIDO P, 2015; VITERI A, 2017; MOYA A, 2002",8,2018,NA,2-S2.0-85054964670,SCOPUS,UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA;UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA;UNIVERSIDAD DE MURCIA,NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"PAGÁN FJB, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY","PAGÁN FJB, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.3390/su10103703,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85054964670&DOI=10.3390%2FSU10103703&PARTNERID=40&MD5=58B96BE55B6C28EED3FE3A4627BD7A08,NA,NA,MDPI,NA,SCO

THIS CHAPTER HIGHLIGHTS AND DISCUSSES SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES-AS WELL AS SOME CHALLENGES-WITH REGARD TO CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION AND NEW MEDIA IN FORMAL EDUCATION. DIGITAL MEDIA, FOR EXAMPLE, OFFER A VARIETY OF POSSIBILITIES OF ENHANCING INTERACTIVITY AND OF VOICING ONE'S OPINION. ADDITIONALLY, CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION CAN MAKE USE OF THESE TOOLS BY ALLOWING FOR A ""TESTING"" AND ""TRYING OUT"" OF POLITICAL ACTION WITHIN THE SMALL SCALE. STILL, DIGITAL MEDIA IN CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION ALSO BEAR SOME CHALLENGES THAT EDUCATORS SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPECTATION THAT ALL STUDENTS-AS THE SO-CALLED DIGITAL NATIVES-ARE COMPETENT IN USING DIGITAL MEDIA, MAY REPRODUCE FURTHER EXCLUSIONS FOR GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO OR (YET) HAVE THE COMPETENCIES OF USING THESE NEW TOOLS. ONE MAJOR FUNCTION OF CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION THEREFORE IS TO AIM FOR THE INCLUSION OF ALL GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND TO MAKE USE OF ALL OPTIONS TO REACH LEARNERS BY THE MEANS OF NEW MEDIA.

THIS IS MAINLY CAUSED BY THE FIRST AND SECOND DIGITAL DIVIDEND BANDS (700 MHZ AND 800 MHZ) IN WHICH A DOMINANT PART OF UHF SPECTRUM HAS BEEN RELEASED FOR LTE MOBILE BROADBAND COMMUNICATION. STUDIES IN THIS FIELD DOMINANTLY FOCUS ON THE EVALUATION OF THE DVB-T2 SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AFFECTED BY LTE WITH DIFFERENT CHANNEL BANDWIDTHS. HENCE, THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE ROBUSTNESS OF THE LTE-DOWNLINK (LTE-DL) SYSTEM INFLUENCED BY DVB-T2 SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR FIXED TV RECEPTION. IN PARTICULAR, DIFFERENT TRAFFIC LOADS, SIGNAL BANDWIDTHS, M-QAM MODULATIONS AND POSSIBLE IN-PHASE/QUADRATURE (IQ) ERRORS ARE CONSIDERED WHICH HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE LTE-DL SYSTEM. THE RESULTS FROM LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS ARE EVALUATED BY THE ERROR VECTOR MAGNITUDE (EVM) AND CARRIER-TO-INTERFERENCE RATIO (C/I) OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. THE MAIN OUTPUTS OF THIS RESEARCH ARTICLE ENABLE TO REVEAL PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT LTE-DL SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS IN THE 800 MHZ BAND.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR OTHER DIGITAL RESOURCES AND INFRA-STRUCTURE, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA RESOURCES ARE DISTRIBUTED RELATIVE TO HEALTH NEED. METHODS: TO EXAMINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA RESOURCES RELATIVE TO HEALTH NEEDS, WE ASSEMBLED COVERAGE AND QUALITY METRICS FOR COMMERCIAL GEOCODING, NEIGHBOURHOOD CHARACTERISATION, AND TRAVEL TIME CALCULATION RESOURCES FOR 183 COUNTRIES. WE DEVELOPED A COUNTRY-LEVEL, COMPOSITE INDEX OF COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA QUALITY/AVAILABILITY AND EXAMINED ITS DISTRIBUTION RELATIVE TO AGE-STANDARDISED ALL-CAUSE AND CAUSE SPECIFIC (FOR THREE MAIN CAUSES OF DEATH) MORTALITY USING TWO INEQUALITY METRICS, THE SLOPE INDEX OF INEQUALITY AND RELATIVE CONCENTRATION INDEX. IN TWO SUB-NATIONAL CASE STUDIES, WE ALSO EXAMINED GEOCODING SUCCESS RATES VERSUS AREA DEPRIVATION BY DISTRICT IN EASTERN REGION, GHANA AND LAGOS STATE, NIGERIA. RESULTS: INTERNATIONALLY, COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA RESOURCES WERE INVERSELY RELATED TO ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN EXAMINING MORTALITY DUE TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA RESOURCES FOR CALCULATING PATIENT TRAVEL TIMES WERE MORE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED RELATIVE TO HEALTH NEED THAN RESOURCES FOR CHARACTERISING NEIGHBOURHOODS OR GEOCODING PATIENT ADDRESSES. COUNTRIES SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA HAVE COMPARATIVELY HIGH COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA AVAILABILITY DESPITE HIGH MORTALITY, WHILST COUNTRIES SUCH AS SOUTH KOREA HAVE COMPARATIVELY LOW DATA AVAILABILITY AND LOW MORTALITY. SUB-NATIONALLY, EVIDENCE WAS MIXED AS TO WHETHER GEOCODING SUCCESS WAS LOWEST IN MORE DEPRIVED DISTRICTS. CONCLUSIONS: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST GLOBAL ANALYSIS OF COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA RESOURCES IN RELATION TO HEALTH OUTCOMES. IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS SOUTH AFRICA WHERE THERE IS HIGH MORTALITY BUT ALSO COMPARATIVELY RICH COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA, THESE DATA RESOURCES ARE A POTENTIAL RESOURCE FOR EXAMINING HEALTHCARE UTILISATION THAT REQUIRES FURTHER EVALUATION. IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS SIERRA LEONE WHERE THERE IS HIGH MORTALITY BUT MINIMAL COMMERCIAL GEOSPATIAL DATA, ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS OPEN DATA USE ARE NEEDED IN QUANTIFYING PATIENT TRAVEL TIMES, GEOCODING PATIENT ADDRESSES, AND CHARACTERISING PATIENTS' NEIGHBOURHOODS. © 2018 THE AUTHOR(S).","GHANA HEALTH SERVICE, KIBI GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, ACCRA, GHANA, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT, HIGHFIELD, SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT, HIGHFIELD, SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT, HIGHFIELD, SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT, HIGHFIELD, SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT, HIGHFIELD, SOUTHAMPTON, SO17 1BJ, UNITED KINGDOM","WRIGHT, J.; GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: J.A.WRIGHT@SOTON.AC.UK","ROTH S, 2016; CAMPBELL O, 2006, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69381-1; SHAW N, 2012, DOI 10.4258/hir.2012.18.2.88; ROSU A, 2016, DOI 10.1111/cag.12262; EDWARDS S, 2014, DOI 10.1111/tgis.12052; SHARMA D, 2016, DOI 10.22605/rrh3640; CHU S, 2015; NNOAHAM K, 2010, DOI 10.1093/pubmed/fdq025; GRUBESIC T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.08.017; PETERSEN J, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10109-010-0113-9; HILBERT M, 1986; BISHOP I, 2000; WILLIAMS S, 2014, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2013.846157; GROCHENIG S, 2014; BARRINGTON-LEIGH C, 2017, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0180698; HART J, 1971; MCLEAN G, 2015, DOI 10.3399/bjgp15x687829; TANSLEY G, 2017; CHAVEHPOUR Y, 2017, DOI 10.1093/heapol/czw172; WRIGHT J, 2006; REGIDOR E, 2004; ANDERSON R, 1997, DOI 10.1097/00001648-199701000-00007; AANENSEN D, 2018; WRIGHT G, 2009; ANUOLUWAP B, 2018; ROBISON K, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00315.x; BILLON M, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10290-009-0045-y; MAKANGA P, 2016; FERGUSON W, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s12942-016-0037-9; AL-TAIAR A, 2010, DOI 10.1186/1476-072x-9-38; STRESMAN G, 2014; BELETSKY L, 2016; MAO H, 2015, DOI 10.1140/epjds/s13688-015-0053-1; WEEKS J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10708-007-9098-4; RIBEIRO A, 2014; MAZUMDAR S, 2008, DOI 10.1186/1476-072x-7-13; RAY N, 2008, DOI 10.1186/1476-072x-7-63; CHAMMARTIN F, 2013; NGWIRA B, 2007; DAVIS C, 2011; JONES G, 2015; NAGENDRA N, 2016, DOI 10.1080/14777622.2016.1244759; OJO A, 2010; AGGREY-KORSAH E, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6732-4_7; ZANDERBERGEN P, 2009; ALBUQUERQUE J, 2016; GIVONI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0263775816652899",6,2018,NA,2-S2.0-85047480036,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON,NOTREPORTED;GEOGRAPHY AND ENVIRONMENT;NOTREPORTED,NA,"DOTSE-GBORGBORTSI W, 2018, INT J HEALTH GEOGR","DOTSE-GBORGBORTSI W, 2018, INT J HEALTH GEOGR",UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM;UNITED KINGDOM,10.1186/s12942-018-0134-z,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85047480036&DOI=10.1186%2FS12942-018-0134-Z&PARTNERID=40&MD5=34E9DA1AC7C04ACC0C84C11A7B643E0D,NA,NA,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.,GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM; ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL; UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON,SCO

ECON.,CONFERENCE PAPER,DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL EXCLUSION; GREECE; INTERNET NON-USE,NA,"DURING THE LAST DECADE, THE INTERNET TAKE-UP RATE IN GREECE AMONG INDIVIDUALS IS MUCH LOWER COMPARED WITH THE EU AVERAGE. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES ISSUES OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN GREECE, BY ANALYZING MICRO-DATA FROM THE EUROSTAT ICT SURVEY ON HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUALS IN 2012. IT AIMS TO QUANTIFY AND EXPLAIN THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS (EMPLOYMENT STATUS, GENDER, AGE, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, COUNTRY OF CITIZENSHIP, FAMILY STATUS, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT), IN THE DECISION TO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME AND USE THE INTERNET. THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AGE, INCOME, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, FAMILY STATUS, COUNTRY OF CITIZENSHIP AND TYPE OF LOCALITY ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS DETERMINING INTERNET ACCESS AND INTERNET USE. THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON FOR NOT HAVING INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME IS THE LACK OF SKILLS, WHILE LOWER EDUCATED PEOPLE FACE MANY DIFFERENT BARRIERS TO ENGAGE WITH THE INTERNET. GREEK NON-USERS ARE A LARGE AND SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED HETEROGENEOUS GROUP.

ALTHOUGH IT HAS A GLOBAL REACH, STILL MORE THAN THREE BILLION PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE WEB, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM LIVE IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH, OFTEN IN RURAL REGIONS, UNDER LOW-RESOURCE CONDITIONS AND WITH POOR INFRASTRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THE NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE SHARING, CONTENT CREATION AND APPLICATION SERVICE PROVISIONING IS NO LESS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN THIS PAPER WE DESCRIBE THE KASADAKA PLATFORM THAT SUPPORTS EASY CREATION OF LOCAL-CONTENT AND VOICE-BASED INFORMATION SERVICES, TARGETED AT CURRENTLY 'UNCONNECTED' POPULATIONS AND MATCHING THE ASSOCIATED RESOURCE AND INFRASTRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS. THE KASADAKA PLATFORM AND ESPECIALLY ITS VOICE SERVICE DEVELOPMENT KIT SUPPORTS THE FORMATION OF AN ECOSYSTEM OF DECENTRALIZED VOICE-BASED INFORMATION SERVICES THAT SERVE LOCAL POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES.

PERSONALITY WAS DEFINED FROM THE FIVE FACTOR MODEL OF PERSONALITY IN TERMS OF OPENNESS, CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, EXTRAVERSION, AGREEABLENESS, AND NEUROTICISM, WHILE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS WERE DEFINED AS GENDER, AGE AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS (E.G. INCOME AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT). THE RESULTS FROM A LARGE, REPRESENTATIVE SWEDISH SAMPLE (N = 1,694) SHOW THAT GLOBAL INTERNET USAGE CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A HIGH DEGREE OF EXTRAVERSION, YOUNG AGE AND HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. OUR FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOME PREVIOUS STUDIES, BUT IN CONTRAST WITH OTHERS. WE DISCUSS CONTRASTING RESULTS IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT STUDY DESIGNS, CULTURES AND TIME PERIODS OF INTERNET DEVELOPMENT. THE RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF THE “RICH GET RICHER MODEL” AND DIGITAL DIVIDES, AND WHAT BROADER IMPLICATION OUR FINDINGS MIGHT HAVE FOR SOCIETY. THE STUDY MAY HELP FACILITATE OUR UNDERSTANDING REGARDING FUTURE CHALLENGES IN THE INTERNET DESIGN. © SPRINGER NATURE SWITZERLAND AG 2018.","UNIVERSITY OF SKÖVDE, SKÖVDE, SWEDEN, UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN","ROOS, J.M.; UNIVERSITY OF SKÖVDESWEDEN; EMAIL: MAGNUS.ROOS@HIS.SE","AKMAN I, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2009.12.007; AMICHAI-HAMBURGER Y, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(01)00034-6; BALLER S, 2016; BAUMEISTER R, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00051.x; BUSELLE R, 1999; CHAMORRO-PREMUZIC T, 2012; CHAUDHURI A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2005.07.001; CHAYKO M, 2017; COSTA P, 1992; COSTA P, 1995, DOI 10.1207/s15327752jpa6401_2; DAVIDSSON P, 2017; DIENER E, 1999; DONAT E, 2009; FARAG S, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01441640500158496; FEIST J, 2009; GARDNER J, 2001; GIGNAC G, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.069; GOLDBERG L, 1990, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1216; GOSLING S, 2003; HEMPHILL J, 2003, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.58.1.78; JACKSON L, 2003; JOHN O, 1990; JONES S, 2009; JONIER R, 2012; KOTLER P, 2009; KRAUT R, 2002; LANDERS R, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.06.001; LARSEN R, 2005; LIN C, 1998, DOI 10.1080/08838159809364436; LOUNSBURY J, 2003, DOI 10.1177/1069072703254501; MARK G, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.03.060; MCELROY J, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148821; MOCNIK D, 2010; NACHMIAS R, 2000, DOI 10.2190/2xlg-fqqj-1y65-9k2e; NORMAN D, 2004; PARK G, 2015; RAMMSTEDT B, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.jrp.2006.02.001; SCHUMACHER P, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(00)00032-7; SMITH P, 2008; SOTO C, 2011, DOI 10.1037/a0021717; TUTEN T, 2001; ULVAEUS B, 1980; VALKENBURG P, 2005, DOI 10.1177/1461444805052282; VERNERSDOTTER F, 2015; WITT E, 2011; YBARRA M, 2008, DOI 10.1093/her/cyl062; ZHANG Y, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.02.006; ZYWICA J, NA",2,2018,NA,2-S2.0-85057086103,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF SKÖVDE,NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF SKÖVDESWEDEN;NOTREPORTED,NA,"ROOS JM, 2018, COMMUN COMPUT INFO SCI","ROOS JM, 2018, COMMUN COMPUT INFO SCI",SWEDEN,10.1007/978-3-030-02846-6_1,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85057086103&DOI=10.1007%2F978-3-030-02846-6_1&PARTNERID=40&MD5=D165FB06C6FCF34401CA6D4DC3397CE6,NA,NA,SPRINGER VERLAG,NA,SCO

HENCE, WE CONCENTRATES ON STUDYING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FROM SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT – THE ONE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. PRIOR STUDIES INDICATE THAT THEIR POSSIBILITIES TO ACCESS AND USE INTERNET ARE LOWER THAN FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES. THIS GAP IS REFERRED AS DIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE. THIS STUDY EMPLOYS A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO ANALYSE DIGITAL DISABILITY DIVIDE IN TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED SOCIETY. OUR DATA IS RETRIEVED FROM A NATIONWIDE SURVEY, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED IN FINLAND DURING YEARS 2012–2015 BY NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND WELFARE.

AT AGBOGBLOSHIE, DESPITE THE INTENTIONS OF NATIONAL GHANAIAN REGULATIONS AND HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS, MOST E-WASTE IS UNTREATED OR CRUDELY PROCESSED VIA BURNING OR ACID BATHS. THESE PRACTICES RELEASE DIOXINS, FURANS, AND HEAVY METALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, INVARIABLY HARMING SCRAPYARD WORKERS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND THE GREATER URBAN COMMUNITY OF ACCRA. HOWEVER, THE SCRAPYARD ALSO PROVIDES A CRITICAL SOURCE OF LIVELIHOOD FOR SOME OF GHANA'S MOST POOR, VULNERABLE, AND UNSKILLED MIGRANTS. THE AIM AND OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO HUMANIZE THE CONUNDRUMS AND CHALLENGES THAT E-WASTE INVOKES IN PLACES SUCH AS GHANA. BASED ON EXTENSIVE AND ORIGINAL FIELD RESEARCH—INCLUDING EXPERT INTERVIEWS, COMMUNITY INTERVIEWS WITH SCRAPYARD WORKERS AND FAMILIES, AND NATURALISTIC OBSERVATION AT WASTE SITES AND OTHER PARTS OF THE E-WASTE SUPPLY CHAIN—THIS STUDY ASKS: WHAT BENEFITS HAS E-WASTE BROUGHT COMMUNITIES IN GHANA? WHAT RISKS HAS IT CREATED? AND, CRITICALLY, WHAT POLICIES NEED IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE E-WASTE MORE SUSTAINABLE? IT DOCUMENTS TEN OSTENSIBLE BENEFITS OF E-WASTE ALONGSIDE TEN VERY REAL AND GROWING RISKS. THEN, IT IDENTIFIES A CONCERT OF FIFTEEN DIFFERENT POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS FOUR RESEARCH GAPS.

FOR THIS PURPOSE, CUSTOMER DATA FROM ALL PUBLIC SAVINGS BANKS IN GERMANY ARE LINKED WITH SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AT REGIONAL LEVEL. AS A RESULT, ATTRIBUTES CAN BE IDENTIFIED THAT PROMOTE A SO-CALLED INFORMATIONAL DIVIDE. THE RISK OF SUCH A DIVIDE IS COMPARATIVELY HIGH IN RURAL, SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS WITH A HIGH AVERAGE AGE OF THE POPULATION AND IN REGIONS WITH A RELATIVELY LOW AVERAGE FORMAL EDUCATION LEVEL. HERE, PEOPLE COULD LOSE ACCESS TO BASIC FINANCIAL SERVICES AS A BASIS FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AS A RESULT OF ONGOING DIGITISATION.

HOW HAVE THE INEQUALITIES IN THE USE OF INTERNET IN BRAZIL VARIED THROUGH TIME? METHODOLOGY: THE PAPER INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE PATTERN OF INTERNET ACCESS AND USE IN BRAZIL USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, DRAWING ON DATA FROM NATIONAL ICT SURVEYS BETWEEN THE YEARS 2000 AND 2019. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INCREASING ACCESS DO NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN A MORE EQUITABLE ADOPTION AND USE OF AVAILABLE ONLINE RESOURCES. THEY HIGHLIGHT A PERSISTENT “DIGITAL ELITE” CAPABLE OF A MORE SOPHISTICATED USE OF THE INTERNET. THE MAINTENANCE - AND EVEN THE INCREASE - OF DIFFERENCES IN THE USE OF INTERNET IS IN LINE WITH PART OF THE LITERATURE ON DIGITAL INCLUSION. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE STUDY UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS TO BETTER MEASURE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ALLOWING IT TO BE USED AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE IN BROADER ANALYSES OF INCOME INEQUALITY AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES, FOR INSTANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PERSISTENCE OF A ""SECOND LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE"" IN BRAZIL POINTS TO THE NEED FOR POLICIES THAT ADDRESS THE ""DIGITAL SKILLS GAP"" ENABLING THE REALIZATION OF THE INTERNET'S POTENTIAL TO EASE SOCIAL DISPARITIES.

INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES ARE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF PARTICIPATION OF OUR ELDERLY PEOPLE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY, ALLOWING ACCESS TO INFORMATION ALONG WITH SOCIAL, EDUCATIONAL OR CULTURAL INTERACTION. THE GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF OUR RESEARCH IS TO KNOW IF OVER THE YEARS DIGITAL COMPETITION INCREASES IN OLDER PEOPLE. TO DO THIS, WE WILL QUANTITATIVELY COMPARE THE BASIC DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN DIFFERENT BLOCKS IN A STUDY CARRIED OUT DURING 2017/2018 AND A NEW STUDY EXECUTED DURING 2018/2019. THE PARTICIPATING SAMPLE IS MADE UP OF THE STUDENTS OF THE PERMANENT OPEN TRAINING CLASSROOM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GRANADA (SPAIN). THE STATISTICAL SOFTWARE IBM SPSS® HAS BEEN USED TO PERFORM THE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS SHOW VARIATIONS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE ACADEMIC YEAR, BUT THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE ELDERLY. DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS NOT ACQUIRED THROUGH A TECHNOLOGICAL IMMERSION, IT IS NECESSARY TO LEARN TO LEARN, BUT THIS ABILITY IS LINKED TO AGE, FOR THIS REASON TRAINING AND EDUCATION WITH OLDER PEOPLE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THE UNIVERSITY MUST PROVIDE SPACES FOR REFLECTION AND TRAINING TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES THAT ARE PROMOTED DUE TO THE CONTINUED USE OF ICT. © 2020 UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE MINAS GERAIS.

THIS PARTICIPATION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE DEGREE OF EDUCATION, TRAINING AND EMPLOYABILITY, AND SO WOMEN BRING ADDED VALUE TO THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR AND NOT ONLY TO IT, BUT ALSO TO ALL SECTORS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, THROUGH THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO R&D AND INNOVATION. THE 17 GOALS ADOPTED IN AGENDA 21 CONSTITUTE A ROADMAP THAT AIMS TO INVOLVE ALL ACTORS AND IMPOSE GENDER EQUALITY IN EACH ONE OF THESE GOALS. IN THIS STUDY, WE COMPARE THE INNOVATION AND GENDER INDEX OF FOUR MEDITERRANEAN COUNTRIES (FRANCE, SPAIN, MOROCCO, AND ALGERIA) AND ANALYZE HOW SOME INDEXES RELATED WITH ""THE GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE"" AFFECT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG) 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 AND 10 ARE THE MOST INFLUENCED BY ICT AND THE GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE, AND THAT NONE OF THE COUNTRIES IN OUR STUDY HAVE ACHIEVED THEM, ALTHOUGH FRANCE AND SPAIN PRESENT A MODERATE TREND TOWARDS THEIR ACHIEVEMENT BY 2030, AND TO SUPPORT THIS STATEMENT, A MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION HAS BEEN PERFORMED AT A GLOBAL LEVEL FOR THE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE ALL OF THE INDICATORS' DATA AVAILABLE. THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT THE GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT AND THAT THE TECHNOLOGY DISPOSITION HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THEM. © 2020 BY THE AUTHORS.","DEPARTAMENTO DE ECONOMÍA DE LA EMPRESA, ESCUELA TÉCNICA SUPERIOR DE INGENIERÍA AGRONÓMICA, UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA, CARTAGENA, 30203, SPAIN;DEPARTAMENTO DE ECONOMÍA DE LA EMPRESA, ESCUELA TÉCNICA SUPERIOR DE INGENIERÍA AGRONÓMICA, UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA, CARTAGENA, 30203, SPAIN;DEPARTAMENTO DE ECONOMÍA DE LA EMPRESA, ESCUELA TÉCNICA SUPERIOR DE INGENIERÍA AGRONÓMICA, UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA, CARTAGENA, 30203, SPAIN;DEPARTAMENTO DE ECONOMÍA DE LA EMPRESA, ESCUELA TÉCNICA SUPERIOR DE INGENIERÍA AGRONÓMICA, UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA, CARTAGENA, 30203, SPAIN","KERRAS, H.; DEPARTAMENTO DE ECONOMÍA DE LA EMPRESA, SPAIN; EMAIL: HAYET.KERRAS@EDU.UPCT.ES","LÓPEZ V, 2002; HAMBURG I, 2019; CASTAÑO C, 2011; FOUNTAIN J, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0160-791x(99)00036-6; TOFFLER H, 1996; AZADNIA M, 2017; GALLIANO D, 2001, DOI 10.1068/a3423; ROGERS E, 2001, DOI 10.1177/135485650100700406; SANTOYO A, 2003; BATISTA M, 2014; BALLESTEROS F, 2002; LU M, 2001, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304; SINGH A, 2003; ROBLES J, 2010; BÜHRER S, 2006; WOLK R, 2004; GONZÁLEZ A, 2017; ANKER R, 1998; RUBIO F, 2008; SEGERMAN-PECK L, 1991; CASTAÑO C, 2002; PENG K, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2008.08.003; MEYSKENS M, 2009; GOLDIN C, 2019; BECKER G, 1975; JABBAZ M, 2019; SÁNCHEZ-VIDAL M, 2016; NKOSINGIPHILE T, 2018; BOTELLA C, 2019, DOI 10.3390/e21010030; CASTAÑO C, 2003; GILHOOLY D, 2005; TORRE-MARÍN G, 2011; RODHAIN F, 2005; CHRISTENSEN T, 2007; BREUIL H, 2008; FLIPO F, 2009; PETIT M, 2009; BORDAGE F, 2009; RODHAIN F, 2009; AIT-DAOUD S, 2011; MOZAS A, 2019; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10668-006-9065-0; FLIPO F, 2012; ESSER K, 1994; PORTER M, 2002; MARLON-RAUDALES C, 2017; ALI M, 2011; HENRY B, 2012; AWUOR F, 2013; GILMORE J, 2015; CAMPOS V, 2017; MOE C, 2006, DOI 10.2166/wh.2006.0043; SASTRE-CENTENO J, 2018, DOI 10.7203/ciriec-e.94.12109; MALUCK J, 2018, DOI 10.3389/fphy.2018.00134; FERNÁNDEZ-PORTILLO A, 2019, DOI 10.3390/su11226307; KOLK A, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jwb.2015.08.010; SOUSA M, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12030884; GARZÓN-CASTRILLON M, 2014; OKOKONDEM E, 2017; FAUCHEUX S, 2011; BATOOL R, 2019; ANDREOPOULOU Z, 2012; YIKUN X, 2007; ACILAR A, 2011; ZIMMERMAN F, 2011; GUPTA V, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusvent.2013.02.002; VILLATORO P, 2005; PIKETTY T, 2014; SAMUELSON P, 1974; WANG S, 2019, DOI 10.3390/su11092708; STIFUNG B, 2019; SRNKA K, 2004; SWAIDAN Z, 2008, DOI 10.2753/mtp1069-6679160203; DUTTA S, 2019; BANEGAS J, 2009; WOLFENSOHN J, 1995; SIMARD D, 1993; SLYKE C, 2010; ACEVEDO D, 2002; DRUMEA C, 2020; HERNÁNDEZ M, 2018",11,2020,NA,2-S2.0-85084634372,SCOPUS,UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA;UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA;UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA;UNIVERSIDAD POLITÉCNICA DE CARTAGENA,NOTREPORTED;DEPARTAMENTO DE ECONOMÍA DE LA EMPRESA;NOTREPORTED,NA,"KERRAS H, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY","KERRAS H, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.3390/su12083347,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85084634372&DOI=10.3390%2FSU12083347&PARTNERID=40&MD5=E8469D11B73F7913BB14B8F067CE1979,NA,NA,MDPI,NA,SCO

HOW CAN CINEMA-GOING MEMORIES ENCOURAGE CROSS-GENERATIONAL ENGAGEMENT? THIS ARTICLE PROPOSES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY USING THE ITALIAN CINEMA AUDIENCES RESEARCH PROJECT AS A CASE STUDY, AND SPECIFICALLY CINEMA-GOING MEMORIES AS INTANGIBLE CULTURAL HERITAGE (ERCOLE ET AL., 2016, CINEMA HERITAGE IN EUROPE: PRESERVING AND SHARING CULTURE BY ENGAGING WITH FILM EXHIBITION AND AUDIENCES. EDITORIAL. ALPHAVILLE: JOURNAL OF FILM AND SCREEN MEDIA, 11(SUMMER): 1-12. WEB. ISSN: 2009-4078). IT AIMS TO TACKLE THE DIFFICULTY OF ENGAGING THE OLDER GENERATION WITH THE DIGITAL WORLD, BY PROPOSING AND TESTING NEW WAYS TO RESOLVE IT. THROUGH A MIXED-METHODS ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH, THIS ARTICLE INVESTIGATES DIFFERENT STRATEGIES: THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS; A CROSSGENERATIONAL ACTIVITY INVOLVING HISTORYPIN, A DIGITAL, USER-GENERATED ARCHIVE OF CROWDSOURCED HISTORICAL MATERIAL; AN ONLINE DEDICATED ARCHIVE BUILT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE OLDER ADULTS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT. THESE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AIM NOT ONLY AT INCREASING DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT AMONG OLDER ADULTS, BUT ALSO AT FURTHERING YOUNGER GENERATIONS' INVOLVEMENT IN SHARED CULTURAL HERITAGE IN AN ONLINE CONTEXT. BY FOCUSING ON THE MEMORIES OF CINEMA-GOING IN 1950S ITALY, THE ARTICLE EXPLORES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. IT ALSO TESTS ANJA K.

IT THUS AIMS TO ANALYSE THE DIGITAL DIMENSION OF JOB SEGREGATION IN THE SPANISH LABOUR MARKET. INTERNET USE IS EXPLORED BOTH AS AN INDICATOR OF THE TYPE OF WORK CARRIED OUT AND, IN AGGREGATE TERMS, OF THE BROADER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LABOUR MARKET. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT A NEW SEGMENTATION OF THE LABOUR MARKET MIGHT BE EMERGING, BASED ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS OF JOBS. THE ARTICLE DRAWS ON DATA FROM A REPRESENTATIVE SPANISH POPULATION SURVEY ON HOW EMPLOYEES ACCESS AND USE THE INTERNET AT WORK. UNIVARIATE, BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO DESCRIBE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DIGITALISED LABOUR PRACTICES AND INDIVIDUAL SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AROUND A THIRD OF SPANISH WORKERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO USE THE INTERNET AT WORK. THIS POPULATION FALLS INTO TWO CATEGORIES: THE ‘ANALOGICAL PRECARIAT’, IN POOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND ‘TRADITIONAL ANALOGICAL LABOUR’, IN BETTER QUALITY TRADITIONAL JOBS. DIGITAL WORKERS CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO THREE GROUPS: THE ‘DIGITAL PRECARIAT’ (WITH A POOR ECONOMIC SITUATION); ‘TRADITIONAL DIGITAL LABOUR’ (MAINLY INVOLVED IN PRODUCTIVE DIGITAL TASKS); AND THE ‘INNOVATIVE CLASS’ (CARRYING OUT PRODUCTIVE AND COMMUNICATIVE DIGITAL TASKS). THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINING VARIABLE, IN RELATION BOTH TO GENERAL AND ADVANCED USES. YOUNG PEOPLE AND WOMEN ARE PROMINENT IN LESS COMPLEX USES OF THE INTERNET (THE DIGITAL PRECARIAT), WHICH ARE USUALLY RELATED TO LESS QUALIFIED JOBS.

THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF GRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY, A FOCUS GROUP WITH THE DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING RESPONDENTS AND THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS OF THE TRAINERS. THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE DIGITAL READING PROGRAM REINFORCED PERSONALLY SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOR TO DEAF AND HARD-OF-HEARING PERSONS. IT RESULTED IN HIGH MOTIVATION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COURSE CONTENT. THE TRAINING HELPED THE RESPONDENTS TO GET ORIENTED IN THE RAPIDLY CHANGING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ACQUIRE USEFUL ICT SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE TO MAKE MORE INFORMED CHOICES OF DIGITAL TOOLS IN FUTURE. THEY ALSO LEARNED ABOUT DIGITAL MEANS FOR VISUAL COMMUNICATION TO SUPPORT THEIR PERSONAL INTERACTION IN FUTURE.

THE PANDEMIC HAS MASSIVELY LAUNCHED TEACHING TOWARDS THE USE OF ICTS AND ONLINE EDUCATION. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ADAPTATION OF UNIVERSITY FACULTY TO THE MASSIVE USE OF ICTS AND EDUCATIONAL DIGITIZATION, AND THE PROMOTION OF SDG 4, WHICH ESTABLISHES TARGET 4.3, ENSURING ACCESS TO QUALITY UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. TO ACHIEVE THIS, A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY METHODOLOGY IS USED, IN WHICH THE RESULTS OF A VALIDATED SURVEY, ON A SAMPLE OF 245 TEACHERS FROM 32 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPANISH UNIVERSITIES, WERE ANALYZED. THE MAIN RESULTS CONSIST OF THE DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL REACTIONS AMONG PROFESSORS, FINDING THAT, ON THE ONE HAND, ICTS ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SKILLS, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW METHODOLOGICAL PROPOSALS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS IN ORDER TO REACH ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS. HOWEVER, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE USE OF ICTS CAUSED AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY, WORKLOADS, AND THE NEED FOR ONGOING TRAINING. THERE IS A NEED TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THE DIGITAL COMPETENCIES OF FACULTY PROFESSORS IN ORDER TO FAVOR ACCESS TO ICTS BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND, THUS, PROMOTE QUALITY EDUCATION WORLDWIDE. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

WE EXPLORE THE CHANGING NATURE OF INTERNET ACCESS BY FOCUSING ON SOCIAL PRACTICES THAT SHAPE THE POSITION AND ROLE OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES IN EVERYDAY INTERNET USE. DRAWING ON THE DOMESTICATION FRAMEWORK, THE STUDY USES DATA FROM QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH UK INTERNET USERS TO EXPLORE HOW TECHNOLOGIES ARE RE-DOMESTICATED. THREE PRACTICES ENCOMPASSING HOW INTERNET USERS DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN INTERNET ACCESS WERE IDENTIFIED: SPOTLIGHTING, DISTRIBUTING, AND MAKING DO. IN ADDITION, ORIENTATION, UNDERSTANDING, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATION INTERNET DEPENDENCIES WERE EXAMINED TO DETERMINE HOW INDIVIDUALS RELATE TO INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES. THE PRACTICES OF RE-DOMESTICATION REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN THE ROLE THAT INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES PLAY IN INDIVIDUALS' DAILY LIVES, AND DIFFERENCES IN THE AVAILABILITY OF OFFLINE RESOURCES. THE STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF INTERNET ACCESS, DEPENDING ON WHETHER ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS ARE SHAPED BY DIGITAL EXCLUSION OR CHOICE. © 2021 THE AUTHOR(S).

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY WOMEN'S MOTIVATION TO PARTICIPATE IN A DIGITAL INCLUSION EXPERIENCE, THEIR PROCESS OF ICT SKILLS ACQUISITION, WHETHER THEY APPLIED ICT INTO THEIR DAILY LIFE, AND WHETHER THIS APPLICATION TRANSLATED INTO BETTER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. WE FOUND THAT INTERNET AND ICT USAGE AMONG VULNERABLE WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS CASE STUDY TENDS TO FOCUS ON COVERING FAMILY NEEDS, LIKE HELPING CHILDREN WITH HOMEWORK OR MONITORING TEEN ACTIVITIES ONLINE, RATHER THAN COVERING THEIR OWN NEEDS. MOTIVATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COURSES WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REACHING INDEPENDENCE IN USAGE, SINCE MOST PARTICIPANTS DEPENDED ON OTHERS TO EXPLAIN TO THEM HOW TO USE THEIR COMPUTING DEVICES, WHICH WERE MOSTLY MOBILE. ALTHOUGH MOTIVATION WAS HIGH, DROPOUTS OCCURRED WITH AN AVERAGE OF THREE WOMEN MISSING EACH COURSE. WOMEN WHO FINISHED THE PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHED INDEPENDENCE AND AUTONOMY IN USAGE FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND NEEDS, NOT ONLY THOSE OF THEIR FAMILIES. LEARNING EXPERIENCES INCREASED WOMEN'S SELF-CONFIDENCE AND SELF-ESTEEM, EMPOWERING THEM TO ACCOMPLISH RELEVANT ICT USAGE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN PRIORITIES, SUCH AS ENHANCING THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES.

WE DEVELOPED AN ECONOMETRICS RESEARCH FRAMEWORK FOR INVESTIGATING FACTORS INFLUENCING SI ON A GLOBAL SCALE. WE FOUND THAT ICT VARIABLES, SUCH AS ICT ACCESS AND ICT BROADBAND NETWORK, POSITIVELY INFLUENCE SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PARAMETERS. DESPITE DIFFERENCES AMONG ECONOMIES IN TERMS OF ICTS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, ICTS ARE THE SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS OF SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. WE OBSERVED A GROWING DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG NATIONS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY AND THE EXPANSION OF DIGITAL COMMERCE, PARTICULARLY IN THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND AFRICA, A PHENOMENON IMPEDING SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION GROWTH. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT EMPIRICALLY INVESTIGATES THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE FROM SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION PERSPECTIVES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT TO TACKLE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES, POLICYMAKERS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES NEED TO PERFORM CONSTRUCTIVE EDUCATIONAL REFORM IN HIGHER EDUCATION CURRICULA, PARTICULARLY CONCERNING STEM PROGRAMS, WHICH SHOULD REFLECT THE NECESSARY SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES FOR DEPLOYING EMERGENT TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, ICT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PART OF A COUNTRY’S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY INVESTMENT IN THE BROADBAND NETWORKS REGARDED AS THE BACKBONE OF TO-DAY’S INNOVATION. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TOPIC, DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS BEEN ALSO EXTENSIVELY STUDIED, ALTHOUGH, HITHERTO, THERE IS NO PREVIOUS RESEARCH THAT WOULD HAVE LINKED THE CONCEPT TO ONLINE MEDIA. GIVEN THIS GAP IN THE LITERATURE, THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE ""MATURITY""OF ONLINE MEDIA IN 134 COUNTRIES BETWEEN 2007 AND 2016. MATURITY IS DEFINED ACCORDING TO THE LEVELS OF NATIONAL ONLINE MEDIA CONSUMPTION, DIVERSITY OF POLITICAL PERSPECTIVES PRESENTED IN NATIONAL ONLINE MEDIA, AND CONSENSUS IN REPORTING MAJOR POLITICAL EVENTS IN NATIONAL ONLINE MEDIA. THESE ASPECTS ARE EXPLAINED BY CONSIDERING EXPLANATORY FACTORS RELATED TO ECONOMY, INFRASTRUCTURE, POLITICS, AND ADMINISTRATION. ACCORDING TO THE EMPIRICAL RESULTS BASED ON A DYNAMIC PANEL DATA METHODOLOGY, VARIABLES REPRESENTING EACH ASPECTS ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE MATURITY OF NATIONAL ONLINE MEDIA. © 2021 ACM.","UNIVERSITY OF TURKU, FINLAND;UNIVERSITY OF TURKU, FINLAND",NA,"AKIMA H, 2020; ANDERSON W, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15228916.2011.588912; ARELLANO M, 1991; CLARKE J, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01296612.2006.11726825; COPPEDGE M, 2021; CROISSANT Y, 2008, DOI 10.18637/jss.v027.i02; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; DAWES S, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0163443714536842; GRISOLD A, 1996, DOI 10.1177/0267323196011004004; HALLIN D, 2004, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511790867; HUMPRECHT E, 2017; KARAR H, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0169796x19890758; KHAN M, 2014; LEWCZUK A, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s10602-020-09313-7; LISSITSA S, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1077699019837938; LOOY A, 2013; MILLER J, 2009, DOI 10.1177/1742766508101312; MORAIS E, 2012, DOI 10.1080/10919392.2012.696952; NEWMAN N, 2020; NICKELL S, 1981; NORRIS P, 2001; ODONGO A, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2910019.2910077; PICK J, 2007, DOI 10.1145/1235000.1235019; PICK J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2013.12.026; PUPPIS M, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0267323108096992; ROOY M, 1978; RUOHONEN J, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s11023-021-09566-7; RUOHONEN J, 2021, DOI 10.1109/icedeg52154.2021.9530996; RUOHONEN J, 2021; SACHDEVA N, 2015, DOI 10.1108/jices-10-2014-0050; SANDS P, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0306422019842095; SHEARLAW M, 2016; SIEBERT F, 1984; THORPE P, 1984, DOI 10.1177/016555158400800504; VARTANOVA E, 2012; WILLIAMSON O, 1991",0,2021,NA,2-S2.0-85122309376,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF TURKU;UNIVERSITY OF TURKU,NOTREPORTED,NA,"RUOHONEN J, 2021, ACM INT CONF PROC SER","RUOHONEN J, 2021, ACM INT CONF PROC SER",FINLAND;FINLAND,10.1145/3485768.3485815,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85122309376&DOI=10.1145%2F3485768.3485815&PARTNERID=40&MD5=F3779801D623981D10308DA21D51453D,NA,NA,ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY,ACADEMY OF FINLAND; STRATEGIC RESEARCH COUNCIL,SCO

USING SURVEY DATA FROM A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF U.S. PARTICIPANTS (N = 2,925) THAT WE COLLECTED DURING THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC, WE ANALYZED HOW SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, LIVING ARRANGEMENTS, AND INTERNET EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS RELATE TO INCREASES AND DECREASES IN VARIOUS DIGITAL COMMUNICATION METHODS. WE FIND THAT PEOPLE PRIVILEGED IN THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, THEIR INTERNET SKILLS AND ONLINE EXPERIENCES ARE MORE LIKELY TO INCREASE AND LESS LIKELY TO DECREASE DIGITAL COMMUNICATION DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATE HOW DIGITAL INEQUALITIES CAN PUT ALREADY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS AT GREATER RISK OF DIMINISHED SOCIAL CONTACT DURING A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

DURING THE COVID-19 EMERGENCY MOST STUDENTS' EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE MOVED FROM FACE-TO-FACE PHYSICAL CLASSROOM TO WEB-BASED ENVIRONMENTS WHICH EXPOSED DISPARITIES IN STUDENTS' DIGITAL RESOURCES AND COMPETENCE AND PLACED GREATER ATTENTION ON THE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE INEQUALITIES. DIGITAL COMPETENCE IS TYPICALLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO USE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE THEIR WORK, STUDY OR PERSONAL OBJECTIVES. BEING DIGITALLY COMPETENT IS SIGNIFICANT WITH REGARD TO AN INDIVIDUAL BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE THINGS THAT THEY VALUE, BUT IS ONLY PART OF AN OVERALL EVALUATION OF THEIR DIGITAL CAPABILITY. THIS PAPER ARGUES THAT IN ADDITION TO COMPETENCE, ASSESSMENT OF DIGITAL CAPABILITY SHOULD INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF A PERSON'S ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS ITS VALUE IN ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS. THIS PAPER IS A WORK IN PROGRESS EXPLORING FINDINGS DERIVED FROM RESEARCH EVALUATING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE STAFF CAPABILITY AND CONFIDENCE IN USING ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES AT EIGHT FE COLLEGES IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND. IN THIS RESEARCH STUDENTS UNDERTOOK SURVEYS THAT INCLUDED SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THEIR DIGITAL COMPETENCES FOLLOWING THE DIGCOMP MODEL, INFORMATION ON THEIR USE OF DIGITAL DEVICES AND HOME NETWORK RELIABILITY, AND EVALUATED THEIR ENJOYMENT OF AND CONFIDENCE IN USING ONLINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS CURRENT PAPER EXPLORES THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE SURVEYS. EVALUATION OF SURVEY DATA REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAD ACCESS TO SUITABLE DEVICES AND RELIABLE NETWORK CONNECTIONS AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN STUDENTS' ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO TAKE PART IN ONLINE LESSONS, THEIR SELF-ASSESSED COMPETENCE, AND THEIR CAPABILITY TO FULLY ENGAGE WITH AND SATISFACTION WITH ONLINE LEARNING.

IN ORDER TO REDUCE THESE INTERFERENCES, THIS WORK PRESENTS A NOVEL AND EFFICIENT BAND-STOP FILTER IMPLEMENTED USING MI-CROSTRIP TECHNOLOGY. THE FILTER, DESIGNED WITH RECTANGULAR SPLIT-RING RESONATORS ETCHED IN THE GROUND PLANE, PROVIDES A CUTOFF FREQUENCY ABOVE CHANNEL 48 (694 MHZ), A HIGH ROLL-OFF RATE OF 44 DB IN 56 MHZ AND A REJECTION BANDWIDTH OF 250 MHZ THAT COVERS THE UPPER UHF BAND OCCUPIED BY 4G AND 5G WITH REJECTION LEVELS CLOSE TO 35 DB. THE FILTER IS MANUFACTURED ENTIRELY OVER A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD WITHOUT LUMPED ELEMENTS TO REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS, FINE TUNING AFTER THE ASSEMBLY STAGE AND MAINTENANCE.

THEREFORE, WE APPLY THE DIGITAL INCLUSION LENS AND EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENTS ON RURAL SCHOOLS IN THE GERMAN CONTEXT. IN 2019, WE CONDUCTED 16 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH HEADS AND TEACHERS FROM RURAL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN BADEN-WURTTEMBERG AND LOWER SAXONY. WE FOUND THAT SMALLER RURAL SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY CAN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES AND CONCLUDE THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF SCHOOLS TO A DIGITAL-INCLUDED SOCIETY IS SUBJECT TO A GEOGRAPHICAL LOTTERY. THIS COULD EVENTUALLY INCREASE EXISTING RURAL–URBAN DIGITAL INEQUALITIES AND THESE FINDINGS ARE ALSO RELEVANT IN LIGHT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, FORCING A SUDDEN SWITCH TO DISTANCE LEARNING. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE PURPOSE IS TWOFOLD: (1) TO IDENTIFY THE THEORIES USED IN THE LITERATURE TO STUDY THE ADOPTION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND (2) TO IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS OF AND BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE LITERATURE REVIEW WAS BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF CONTRIBUTIONS PUBLISHED IN THE 1998–2019 PERIOD. THE SEARCH WAS BOTH AUTOMATED AND MANUAL, BROWSING THROUGH REFERENCES OF WORKS PREVIOUSLY FOUND VIA HIGH-QUALITY DIGITAL LIBRARIES. FINDINGS: DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS (DOIS) IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK IN THE LITERATURE REVIEWED, THOUGH IT IS OFTEN COMBINED WITH OTHER INNOVATION ADOPTION THEORIES. IN ADDITION, FARMS’ AND FARMERS’ TRAITS, TOGETHER WITH TECHNOLOGICAL FEATURES, PLAY A KEY ROLE IN EXPLAINING THE ADOPTION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: SO FAR, RESEARCH HAS POSITIONED THE DETERMINANTS OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION MAINLY WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE FARM. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: ON THE PRACTICAL LEVEL, THE EXTENSIVE DETERMINANTS’ REVIEW HAS POTENTIAL TO SERVE THE AIM OF POLICYMAKERS AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES, TO CLEARLY AND THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND ADOPTION DYNAMICS AND ELABORATE SPECIFIC STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH THEM.

WE PRESENT THE MAIN RESULTS OF THE IMPACT OF THIS ACTIVITY FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF N = 63 VOLUNTEERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN IT. USING STUDENT’S T-TEST FOR RELATED SAMPLES, THE DIFFERENCES IN VOLUNTEERS’ COMPETENCIES BEFORE (PRE-TEST) AND AFTER (POST-TEST) THE EXPERIENCE WERE TESTED, IN ORDER TO ANALYZE WHETHER THE ACTIVITY HAD ALSO EXERTED AN IMPACT ON THESE COMPETENCIES. MOREOVER, A CORRELATION ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED BETWEEN THE ITEMS FOR EVALUATING FAMILY PARTICIPATION BY THE VOLUNTEERS, VOLUNTEER SKILLS, AND TRAINING, WITH THE AIM OF TESTING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THOSE VARIABLES AS A RESULT OF PARTICIPATION IN THE EXPERIENCE. RESULTS SHOW THAT FAMILIES FOUND THAT ACCOMPANIMENT IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THEIR CHILDREN, MAKING THEM FEEL LOVED AND ACCOMPANIED. IN ADDITION, THE FAMILY ATMOSPHERE WAS IMPROVED, AS DID THE CHILDREN’S INTEREST IN READING. THIS MODE OF TRAINING LED TO GREATER INVOLVEMENT, MOTIVATION, AND INTEREST, THEREBY COMPLYING WITH A TRANSVERSAL AXIS OF THE PROCESS-COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

WE START BY POSITIONING ESPORTS IN THE DOMAIN OF SPORT TECHNOLOGY, INNOVATION, AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THEN, WE EXAMINE FOUNDATIONS OF THE ESPORTS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ECOSYSTEM, AND OUTLINE POTENTIAL LINKS TO DIGITAL MARKETING. WE INTERVIEWED NINE EXPERTS, REPRESENTING DISTINCT SPORT CLUBS, SPONSORS AND CONSULTING AGENCIES FROM GERMANY, WITH THE AIM OF GENERATING SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CHARACTERISTICS OF SPONSORING AND MARKETING OPERATIONS IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY, INCLUDING REASONS FOR ENTRY, CHOOSING RELEVANT MARKETING CHANNELS AND IMPLEMENTATION APPROACHES. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXAMINE MEASURES OF SUCCESS, PREVAILING RISKS AS WELL AS FUTURE PERSPECTIVES OF THE INDUSTRY. IN WRITING THIS PAPER, WE CONTRIBUTE TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NASCENT FIELD OF ESPORTS, SPECIFICALLY FROM A DIGITAL MARKETING PERSPECTIVE. A CENTRAL CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY IS THE ILLUSTRATION OF ESPORTS' VALUE FOR SPORT MARKETERS, WHILE SHEDDING LIGHT ON HOW DIGITAL MARKETING POTENTIAL CAN BE LEVERAGED ON AN OPERATIONAL LEVEL.

RESEARCHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED DEMOGRAPHIC, ATTITUDINAL FACTORS AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES RELATED TO INEQUALITIES IN ACCESS, SKILLS, AND ACTIVITIES OF INTERNET USE. WHILE THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR YEARS, STUDIES ABOUT THE DIGITAL INEQUALITIES RELATED TO THE USE OF SMARTPHONES BY OLDER ADULTS ARE STILL SCARCE, AND THEY RARELY HAVE UNDERTAKEN SOCIOCULTURAL COMPARISONS OF USAGE. THIS ARTICLE BUILDS ON AN ANALYSIS OF TRACKING DATA OF OLDER ADULTS’ (PP. 55–79) SMARTPHONE USE, TO EXPLORE DIGITAL INEQUALITIES AROUND TRADITIONAL AXES OF INEQUALITY AND SOCIOCULTURAL FACTORS THAT SHAPE OLDER ADULTS’ SMARTPHONE USE. IT ADDS A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE FOR UNDERSTANDING EMERGING INEQUALITIES RELATED TO SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXTS TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT DIFFERENCES CANNOT BE EXPLAINED SOLELY BY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, BUT ALSO POSSIBLY BY NATIONAL POLICIES AND CULTURE. PARTICULARLY, AGE, ON ITS OWN, IS NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES REPORTED. OLDER ADULTS ENGAGE IN A RANGE OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES ON THEIR SMARTPHONES, AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS ACROSS THE TRADITIONAL AXES OF INEQUALITIES DO NOT MIRROR EXACTLY THE DIFFERENCES FOUND IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON INTERNET USE.

THE WORK PRESENTED HERE SHOWS THAT THIS IDEA IS DEBATABLE. DATA FROM SPAIN, A COUNTRY WHERE DAILY INTERNET USERS ARE 75.9 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION, PROVE THAT THE GENDER GAP STILL EXISTS. THE PAPER EXPLORES IF THIS GAP CAN BE ENTIRELY EXPLAINED BY THE SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. WE BUILD A MICRO PANEL MODEL AND INCORPORATE A SET OF SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES (AGE, EDUCATION, INCOME, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, DIGITAL SKILLS, AND RESIDENT POPULATION) THAT ALLOW US TO ISOLATE THE EFFECTS OF GENDER ON THE DECISION TO BECOME A DAILY INTERNET USER. THE RESULTS CONCLUDE THAT THE INTERNET GAP IS A PHENOMENON WITH A SPECIFIC GENDER COMPONENT. OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL A WOMAN NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE PROBABILITY OF USING THE INTERNET. APPLYING A SIMILAR MODEL TO 15 INTERNET SERVICES, WE OBTAIN THAT GENDER IS ALWAYS SIGNIFICANT TO EXPLAIN THE LIKELIHOOD OF BEING A USER OF EACH SERVICE. HOWEVER, IN SOME SERVICES (7 OUT OF 15), THE EFFECT IS FAVORABLE TO WOMEN, AND FOR OTHER SERVICES (8), THE GENDER EFFECT FAVORS MEN.

OVER TIME, THIS CHALLENGE HAS BECOME A COMPLEX SOCIETAL ISSUE WITH DIRECT ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS IN MANY AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PHENOMENON IS CRUCIAL FROM THE LABOUR MARKET PERSPECTIVE, AT BOTH THE MACROECONOMIC AND MICROECONOMIC LEVELS. DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ONLINE BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE INCREASED RAPIDLY. THESE CHANGES HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED TO EXPLORE THE PROBLEMS OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND/OR THE UNSATISFACTORY DIGITAL SKILLS OF THE LABOUR FORCE MORE DEEPLY. OUR PAPER AIMS TO IDENTIFY HOW DIGITAL EXCLUSION IS MANIFESTED IN THE SLOVAK LABOUR MARKET AND HIGHLIGHT THE TENDENCIES THAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ACCENTUATED. IN THE ANALYSIS, WE USE AVAILABLE AGGREGATE-LEVEL AND INDIVIDUAL DATA CHARACTERISING THE SLOVAK LABOUR MARKET FROM THE MACRO-PERSPECTIVE, COMPARING IT TO THE OTHER EU MEMBER STATES. TO GAIN A MORE COMPOSITE PICTURE FROM THE MICROECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, WE USE ORIGINAL QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY DATA GAINED FROM MEDIUM-SIZED AND LARGE ENTERPRISES IN SLOVAKIA. ACCORDING TO OUR FINDINGS, THE PROPORTION OF INTERNET NON-USERS IN THE SLOVAK AND EUROPEAN POPULATIONS DECLINED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER, WE IDENTIFIED A RISK OF THE DURABILITY OF DIGITALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS OF THE POPULATION AMONG THOSE WHO ARE AT LEAST 55 YEARS OLD, THOSE WITH A LOW EDUCATION LEVEL, AND PEOPLE IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS.

DIGIT. HEALTH,ARTICLE,CANCER CARE; DIGITAL DIVIDE; INDIA; PANDEMIC; POLICY; TECHNOLOGY,NA,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED MAJOR DISRUPTIONS TO DELIVERY OF VARIOUS CANCER CARE SERVICES AS EFFORTS WERE PUT TO CONTROL THE OUTBREAK OF THE PANDEMIC. ALTHOUGH THE PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE INADEQUACIES OF THE SYSTEM BUT HAS ALSO LED TO EMERGENCE OF A NEW CANCER CARE DELIVERY MODEL WHICH RELIES HEAVILY ON DIGITAL MEDIUMS. DIGITAL HEALTH IS NOT ONLY RESTRICTED TO VIRTUAL DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION BUT HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS RANGING FROM SUPPORT TO CANCER SCREENING, EARLY AND MORE ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS TO INCREASING ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED CARE. THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE CHALLENGES IN THE ADOPTION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES TO DELIVER CANCER CARE SERVICES AND PROVIDES RECOMMENDATION FOR LARGE-SCALE ADOPTION IN THE INDIAN HEALTHCARE CONTEXT. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A SEARCH OF PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR FOR NUMEROUS TERMS RELATED TO ADOPTION OF DIGITAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES FOR CANCER CARE DURING PANDEMIC. WE ALSO ANALYZE VARIOUS SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL CHALLENGES—FROM INDIVIDUAL TO COMMUNITY, PROVIDER AND SYSTEMATIC LEVEL—FOR DIGITAL ADOPTION OF CANCER CARE SERVICE WHICH HAVE EXISTED PRIOR TO PANDEMIC AND LEAD TO DIGITAL INEQUALITIES. RESULTS: DESPITE ENCOURAGING BENEFITS ACCRUING FROM THE ADOPTION OF DIGITAL HEALTH KEY CHALLENGES REMAIN FOR LARGE SCALE ADOPTION. WITH RESPECT TO USER THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS AGE, LITERACY AND SOCIO-CULTURAL NORMS ARE THE MAJOR BARRIERS. THE KEY CHALLENGES FACED BY PROVIDERS INCLUDE REGULATORY ISSUES, DATA SECURITY AND THE INCONVENIENCE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITION TO A NEW SYSTEM. POLICY SUMMARY: FOR EQUITABLE DIGITAL HEALTHCARE, THE NEED IS TO HAVE A PARTICIPATORY APPROACH OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND URGENTLY ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ADEQUATELY. SHARING OF HEALTH DATA OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HOSPITALS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE INDIAN REGULATIONS AND DATA PROTECTION ACT, IS CRITICAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL HEALTH IN INDIA AND IT CAN GO A LONG WAY IN BETTER FORECASTING AND MANAGING CANCER BURDEN.

THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY THE FACILITATORS OF INCLUSION OF RURAL WOMEN IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, ADDRESSING THE SELF-DEFINITION OF THE LEVEL OF AUTONOMY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE MEDIA AND THE EXISTENCE OF DIFFERENCES IN THE PERCEPTION OF THESE FACILITATORS BASED ON AGE. TO DO THIS, WE START FROM A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH AND A DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGY BY APPLYING THE SIRWOP QUESTIONNAIRE TO A RANDOM SAMPLE OF 400 WOMEN (BETWEEN 15 AND 75 YEARS OLD) FROM RURAL SETTINGS LOCATED IN THE PROVINCE OF CÁCERES. THE RESULTS OBTAINED REVEAL DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTONOMY WHERE YOUNG WOMEN WITH MORE EDUCATION AND INCOME PRESENT BETTER TECHNOLOGICAL PERFORMANCE. ALSO, DIFFERENCES ARE OBSERVED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF ENABLERS FOR THE USE OF TECHNOLOGIES, SO YOUNG WOMEN HAVE GREATER SUPPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. IN GENERAL, THERE IS A POSITIVE PERCEPTION ABOUT THE FACILITATING ASPECTS OF DIGITAL INCLUSION, HIGHLIGHTING THE SUPPORT OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND BETTER ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGIES.

THE CHALLENGE IS TO INCLUDE WOMEN AS EQUAL PARTNERS IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, IN WHICH WIKIPEDIA IS DEVELOPING A CENTRAL ROLE AS THE MOST USED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE AMONG STUDENTS, PROFESSIONALS, AND MANY OTHER PROFILES.

HEALTH,REVIEW,COVID-19; DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL HEALTH; LITERACY; MISINFORMATION; VULNERABLE,NA,"BACKGROUND: PEOPLE FROM LOWER AND MIDDLE SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE AMONG THE WORST AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THUS EXACERBATING DISPARITIES AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. OBJECTIVE: TO DRAW A PORTRAIT OF E-SERVICES AS A DIGITAL APPROACH TO SUPPORT DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AMID THE COVID-19 INFODEMIC, AND IDENTIFY THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS FOR THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. METHODS: A SCOPING REVIEW WAS PERFORMED TO GATHER PUBLISHED LITERATURE WITH A BROAD RANGE OF STUDY DESIGNS AND GREY LITERATURE WITHOUT EXCLUSIONS BASED ON COUNTRY OF PUBLICATION. A SEARCH WAS CREATED IN MEDLINE (OVID) IN MARCH 2021 AND TRANSLATED TO MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, SCOPUS AND CINAHL WITH FULL TEXT (EBSCOHOST). THE COMBINED LITERATURE SEARCH GENERATED 819 MANUSCRIPTS. TO BE INCLUDED, MANUSCRIPTS HAD TO BE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH, AND PRESENT INFORMATION ON DIGITAL INTERVENTION(S) (E.G. SOCIAL MEDIA) USED TO ENABLE OR INCREASE DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (E.G. OLDER ADULTS, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE LIVING ON RESERVE). RESULTS: FIVE ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. VARIOUS DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY-ENABLING E-SERVICES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN DIFFERENT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IDENTIFIED E-SERVICES AIMED TO INCREASE DISEASE KNOWLEDGE, DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY AND SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE, HELP IN COPING WITH CHANGES IN ROUTINES AND PRACTICES, DECREASE FEAR AND ANXIETY, INCREASE DIGITAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS, DECREASE HEALTH LITERACY BARRIERS AND INCREASE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE IN SPECIFIC GROUPS. MANY FACILITATORS OF DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY-ENABLING E-SERVICES IMPLEMENTATION WERE IDENTIFIED IN EXPECTANT MOTHERS AND THEIR FAMILIES, OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH LOW-INCOME. BARRIERS SUCH AS LOW LITERACY LIMITED TO NO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE VIRUSES, MEDIUM OF CONTAMINATION, TREATMENT OPTIONS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISTRACTING AND BELIEVING IN MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION. POOR HEALTH LITERACY WAS THE ONLY BARRIER FOUND, WHICH MAY HINDER THE UNDERSTANDING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH NEEDS, ILLNESS PROCESSES AND TREATMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV/AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: THE LITERATURE ON THE TOPIC IS SCARCE, SPARSE AND IMMATURE. WE DID NOT FIND ANY LITERATURE ON DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY IN INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, THOUGH WE TARGETED THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW PAPERS WERE INCLUDED, TWO TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS WERE COVERED BY THE LITERATURE ON DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY-ENABLING E-SERVICES, NAMELY CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND CONDITIONS THAT ARE NEW TO THE PATIENTS. DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY CAN HELP IMPROVE PREVENTION AND ADHERENCE TO A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, IMPROVE CAPACITY BUILDING AND ENABLE USERS TO TAKE THE BEST ADVANTAGE OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE, THUS STRENGTHENING THE PATIENT’S INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH DECISIONS AND EMPOWERMENT, AND FINALLY IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES. THEREFORE, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PURSUE RESEARCH ON DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY AND DEVELOP DIGITAL PLATFORMS TO HELP SOLVE CURRENT AND FUTURE COVID-19-RELATED HEALTH NEEDS. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.","DEPARTMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, COLLEGE OF REHABILITATION SCIENCES, RADY FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA, CANADA, CENTRE ON AGING, UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA, CANADA, RIVERVIEW HEALTH CENTRE, CANADA;DEPARTMENT OF RESPIRATORY THERAPY, COLLEGE OF REHABILITATION SCIENCES, RADY FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA, CANADA;DEPARTMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, FACULTY OF HEALTH, CENTER OF EXPERTISE URBAN VITALITY, AMSTERDAM UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES, NETHERLANDS, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE FOR OLDER PEOPLE, PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE, AMSTERDAM UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTERS, VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT, NETHERLANDS;RESEARCH QUALITY MANAGEMENT SECTION, KING ABDULLAH INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER, KING SAUD BIN ABDUL-AZIZ UNIVERSITY FOR HEALTH SCIENCES, MINISTRY OF NATIONAL GUARD - HEALTH AFFAIRS, SAUDI ARABIA;NEIL JOHN MACLEAN HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY, UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA, CANADA;GRADUATE INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS, COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, TAIPEI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, TAIWAN, INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ICHIT), COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, TAIPEI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, TAIWAN","CHOUKOU, M.-A.; DEPARTMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, CANADA; EMAIL: AMINE.CHOUKOU@UMANITOBA.CA","PATIL U, 2021; SYED ABDUL S, 2021; KOR P, 2021; DADACZYNSKI K, 2021; CINELLI M, 2020; ISLAM M, 2020; BHATTACHARYA C, 2021; BERKMAN N, 2010; HARRIS K, 2019; VAN DER VAART R, 2017; NGUYEN L, 2021; VRDELJA M, 2021; NORMAN C, 2006, DOI 10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9; LEUNG A, 2021; CHANG B, 2004; CLARK B, 2018; BRACKEN-ROCHE D, 2017; ADAY L, 1994; DE GROOT N, 2019; ASSOCIATION W, 2009; GREENALL M, 2017; TANGCHAROENSATHIEN V, 2015; CLAESON M, 2008; JENNINGS B, 2016; SOOMRO K, 2020; GIULIANI M, 2020; JAFREE S, 2021; MARTINS VAN JAARSVELD G, 2020; ARKSEY H, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1364557032000119616; LEVAC D, 2010, DOI 10.1186/1748-5908-5-69; BRAMER W, 2016; OUZZANI M, 2016; NOWELL L, 2017; BRAUN V, 2006, DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; KING N, 2004; MOHER D, 2009; QUINN L, 2021; GUVEN D, 2020; PASADINO F, 2020; SAIBENE A, 2020; LI X, 2020; NORGAARD O, 2015; VAN TILBURG T, 2020; CHOUKOU M, 2021; SIXSMITH A, 2020; VOIGT-BARBAROWICZ M, 2020; WILDENBOS G, 2018; SYED-ABDUL S, 2013",13,2022,NA,2-S2.0-85125765009,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA;UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA;AMSTERDAM UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES;KING SAUD BIN ABDUL-AZIZ UNIVERSITY FOR HEALTH SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA;TAIPEI MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"CHOUKOU M-A, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH","CHOUKOU M-A, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH",CANADA;CANADA;CANADA;NETHERLANDS;SAUDI ARABIA;CHINA,10.1177/20552076221076927,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85125765009&DOI=10.1177%2F20552076221076927&PARTNERID=40&MD5=00B271F5C936D0AAB0BD13C2EE3BE6D8,NA,NA,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC.,SOCIETY FOR ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES; UNIVERSITY OF MANITOBA,SCO

MANAGE.,ARTICLE,DIGITAL DIVIDE; DIGITAL INCLUSION; DIGITAL INEQUALITY; DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION; DIGITALLY VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUPS; V4 COUNTRIES,NA,"THE V4 COUNTRIES HAVE ACHIEVED DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION DUE TO DISTINCTIONS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND HUMAN CAPITAL CHARACTERISTICS. THE SUCCESS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION CANNOT BE MEASURED SOLELY BY THE ACHIEVED LEVEL OF DIGITALIZATION; THE DISTRIBUTION OF FAVORABLE OUTCOMES OF INTERNET USE WITHIN A COUNTRY SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED. THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL SKILLS AND USAGE PATTERNS DIFFER AMONG SOCIAL GROUPS, THEREFORE CAPABILITY TO TRANSLATE INTERNET ACCESS AND USE TO TANGIBLE (OFFLINE) BENEFITS VARIES. THE AIM OF OUR PAPER IS TWOFOLD. FIRSTLY, WE QUANTIFY THE EXTENT OF THE DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN TERMS OF USAGE GAP IN THE V4 COUNTRIES. WE INDICATE THE DYNAMICS OF INEQUALITY BY COMPARING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH INEQUALITY BETWEEN THE YEARS 2015 AND 2019. SECONDLY, WE IDENTIFY SOCIOECONOMIC AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE CONNECTED TO DIFFERENCES IN INTERNET USAGE PATTERNS AND THEREFORE AFFECT THE CAPABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO BENEFIT FROM INTERNET USE. IN COMMON WITH OTHER STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN THE WESTERN WORLD, WE SHOW THAT INTERNET ACCESS AND POSSESSION OF FORMAL DIGITAL SKILLS ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF PROBABILITY OF BEING A DIGITAL BENEFICIARY; INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS, ESPECIALLY EDUCATION AND AGE, PREDICT THE PROBABILITY OF BEING A DIGITAL BENEFICIARY TO A HIGHER DEGREE OF ACCURACY. AS TO THE EXTENT OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY IN THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES, WE COME TO CONCLUSION THAT ALTHOUGH THE V4 COUNTRIES ARE RELATIVELY HOMOGENEOUS CONCERNING SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES, THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY AMONG THEM DIFFERS – HUNGARY BEING SOMEWHAT UNEQUAL AS COMPARED TO THE MOST EQUAL CZECHIA.

ALTHOUGH A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE SECOND-LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE WITH A FOCUS ON GENERAL INTERNET AND DIGITAL MEDIA USE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PATTERNS OF SMARTPHONE USE AND SMARTPHONE-RELATED SKILLS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THIS PAPER EXAMINES INEQUALITIES IN THE USE OF SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY BASED ON TWO NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES OF SMARTPHONE OWNERS COLLECTED IN GERMANY IN 2017 AND 2020. WE IDENTIFY SIX DISTINCT TYPES OF SMARTPHONE USERS BY CONDUCTING LATENT CLASS ANALYSES THAT CLASSIFY INDIVIDUALS BASED ON THEIR FREQUENCY OF SMARTPHONE USE, SELF-RATED SMARTPHONE SKILLS, AND ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT ON THEIR SMARTPHONE.

FOR INVESTIGATING THE FACTORS EXPLAINING WHETHER OLDER ADULTS USE THE INTERNET OR NOT, LOGISTIC REGRESSION HAS BEEN USED, WHICH REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE CARE IN THE COMPUTATION AND REPORTING OF REGRESSION MODELS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO ASSESS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE EXAMINING INTERNET USE AMONG OLDER ADULTS (AGED 55 +) ADDRESSES COMMONLY RECOMMENDED QUALITY CRITERIA FOR LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. WE CARRIED OUT A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN SCOPUS AND PUBMED FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES REPORTING THE APPLICATION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION, PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2010 AND 2020. THIRTY-SIX ARTICLES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION. WE EVALUATED THE ARTICLES FOR SIX ANALYTIC AND THREE DOCUMENTATION CRITERIA. EVERY ARTICLE DESCRIBED THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLES AND THEIR CODING. MOST STUDIES HAD SUFFICIENT EVENTS PER INDEPENDENT VARIABLE (83%), REPORTED POINT AND INTERVAL ESTIMATES OF EFFECT SIZES (81%), AND STATED THE FITTING PROCEDURE USED (81%). THE REPORTING RATES WERE LOWER FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF MODEL FIT (53%), CONSIDERATION OF INTERACTIONS (44%), AND TESTING FOR CONFORMITY WITH LINEAR GRADIENT (42%) AND COLLINEARITY (31%). THIS REVIEW PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE INSIGHTS INTO THE STATE OF ADOPTION OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. WE SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS FOR REPORTING ON THE STUDIES SPECIFIC TO OLDER ADULTS’ INTERNET USE, WHICH CAN PROMOTE THE ACCURATE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES AND THE INTEGRATION OF EVIDENCE FROM SINGLE STUDIES. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S).","INSTITUTE OF HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM, SCHWERZSTR. 35, STUTTGART, 70599, GERMANY;INSTITUTE OF HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM, SCHWERZSTR. 35, STUTTGART, 70599, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF DECISION AND INFORMATION SCIENCES, OAKLAND UNIVERSITY, 442 ELLIOTT HALL, ROCHESTER, MI  48309, UNITED STATES","LEUKEL, J.; INSTITUTE OF HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC MANAGEMENT, SCHWERZSTR. 35, GERMANY; EMAIL: JOERG.LEUKEL@UNI-HOHENHEIM.DE","BERNER J, 2019; LAM S, 2020; YU K, 2021; HARGITTAI E, 2018; CORREA T, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2018.1555270; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; QUAN-HAASE A, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1305428; SHMUELI G, 2010; HAIR J, 2018; GE W, 2010; PENG C, 1988; NORSTRÖM F, 2015; BAGLEY S, 2001; CONCATO J, 1993; HARRELL F, 2015; KLEINBAUM D, 2014; HOSMER D, 2000; MONGEON P, 2016; SINGH V, 2021; SPIRDUSO W, 2005; HIGGINS J, 2008; OTTENBACHER K, 2004; HARRELL F, 1985; HARRELL F, 1996; COURVOISIER D, 2011; KATZ M, 2003; RYAN T, 2008; HOSMER D, 1997; MILLER M, 1991; AUSTIN P, 2004; MOHER D, 2009; ALI-HASSAN H, 2020; ANDERBERG P, 2020; BERNER J, 2012; BERNER J, 2004; BERNER J, 2015; BURNS P, 2018; CHANG J, 2015; CHOI N, 2011; CHOI N, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2645; CROUCH E, 2019; ECHT K, 2011; FRIEMEL T, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; GALLISTL V, 2020; GAZIBARA T, 2016; GOUNOPOULOS E, 2020; HARGITTAI E, 2017, DOI 10.22230/cjc.2017v42n2a3176; HONG Y, 2003; KERÄNEN N, 2017; LESAUSKAITĖ V, 2019; LEUKEL J, 2020; LISSITSA S, 2015; PARK S, 2020; QUITTSCHALLE J, 2020; RÄSÄNEN P, 2016; RICHTER D, 2013; SEDRAK M, 2020; SEIFERT A, 2018; SEIFERT A, 2017; SHENG X, 2015; SIREN A, 2017; SUN X, 2020; WARING M, 2019; WEBER W, 2020; YOON H, 2020; HUNSAKER A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818787348; SALIVE M, 2013; ALI M, 2021; KALIL A, 2010; ZHANG Y, 2017; LIN M, 2013; WASSERSTEIN R, 2016; GREENLAND S, 2016; HEINZE G, 2017; PETROVČIČ A, 2022; QUAN-HAASE A, 2018; KELLEY K, 2003; HUI W, 2019",0,2022,NA,2-S2.0-85143582939,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM;UNIVERSITY OF HOHENHEIM;OAKLAND UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;NOTDECLARED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"LEUKEL J, 2022, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC","LEUKEL J, 2022, UNIVERS ACCESS INF SOC",GERMANY;GERMANY;USA,10.1007/s10209-022-00960-1,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85143582939&DOI=10.1007%2FS10209-022-00960-1&PARTNERID=40&MD5=7C780DD2700A07ECF6A2046CA3A73DCD,NA,NA,SPRINGER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS MEDIA DEUTSCHLAND GMBH,OAKLAND UNIVERSITY; BUNDESMINISTERIUM FÜR BILDUNG UND FORSCHUNG,SCO

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND THE SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES (ACCORDING TO DIGCOMP 2.1) ON THE EVALUATION OF THE PROSPECTS FOR BUILDING A DIGITAL ECONOMY BY UKRAINIAN CITIZENS, AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE PROCESSES OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ECONOMY BY STAKEHOLDERS. THE INFORMATION BASE OF THIS STUDY INCLUDED ONLINE SURVEY DATA, PROCESSED USING THE SPSS PACKAGE. FOUND REGULARITIES WERE VERIFIED USING STANDARD STATISTICAL PARAMETERS OF THE RELATIONSHIP. AT THE FIRST STAGE, THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL SKILLS ON THE JUDGMENTS, ATTITUDES, AND EXPECTATIONS OF RESPONDENTS ON THE PROSPECTS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN UKRAINE AND THE WORLD WAS FOUND. DEPENDING ON THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ICT, THE ARCHETYPES OF THE RESPONDENTS WERE DISTINGUISHED (OPTIMIST, PRAGMATIST, AGNOSTIC, RATIONALIST/CAUTIOUS PESSIMIST, AND SCEPTIC). THE SECOND STAGE INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL SKILLS ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE LIFE OF UKRAINIAN CITIZENS, NAMELY ON THEIR DAILY LIFE, ON THEM AS CONSUMERS AND AS WORKERS. IT WAS FOUND THAT A HIGHER LEVEL OF DIGITAL SKILLS CONTRIBUTES TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF RESPONDENTS’ EVERYDAY LIFE; THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF RESPONDENTS WHO USE INTERNET RESOURCES IN EVERYDAY LIFE. THE KEY CONCLUSIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS: 1) FOCUSED EFFORTS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL SKILLS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO AN INCREASE IN THE SHARE OF OPTIMISTIC AND PRAGMATIC ASSESSMENTS OF DIGITALISATION; 2) THE DETECTED DIGITAL GAP BETWEEN THE POSSESSION OF SKILLS AND THE NEED FOR THEM (2-3 TIMES) ACTUALISES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES AIMED AT OVERCOMING IT; 3) THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPACT OF THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL SKILLS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITIZENS AND SATISFACTION WITH THE PRODUCTS OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IS GROWING; 4) THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ECONOMY RADICALLY CHANGES ITS STRUCTURE, THE LANDSCAPE OF THE LABOUR MARKET, AND HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON EVERY CITIZEN. FOREMOST, THOSE WHO HAVE AN ELEVATED LEVEL OF DIGITAL SKILLS WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM DIGITALISATION.

AT THE TIME OF ITS INCEPTION, DIGITAL DETERMINANTS ONLY PLAYED A MINOR ROLE IN TACKLING INEQUITIES IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND WERE THEREFORE NOT SPECIFICALLY CONSIDERED. THIS HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED: FROM TODAY'S PERSPECTIVE, HEALTH INEQUITIES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON DIGITAL DETERMINANTS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SUGGEST ADAPTING THE DAHLGREN-WHITEHEAD MODEL TO REFLECT THESE DEVELOPMENTS. WE PROPOSE A MODEL THAT ALLOWS FORMULATING TESTABLE HYPOTHESES, INTERPRETING RESEARCH FINDINGS, AND DEVELOPING POLICY IMPLICATIONS AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE GLOBAL SPREAD OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. THIS MAY FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW LINE OF RESEARCH AND LOGIC MODELS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS IN THE DIGITAL AGE. USING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AS A CASE STUDY, WE ILLUSTRATE HOW THE DIGITIZATION OF ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE AFFECTS THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INEQUITIES IN THE DAHLGREN–WHITEHEAD MODEL. IN DOING SO, WE DELIBERATELY ARGUE FOR NOT INTRODUCING A SEPARATE DIGITAL SPHERE IN ITS OWN RIGHT, BUT FOR UNDERSTANDING DIGITIZATION AS A PHENOMENON THAT PERMEATES ALL LEVELS OF DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INEQUITIES. AS A RESULT, WE PRESENT A DIGITAL RAINBOW MODEL THAT INTEGRATES DAHLGREN AND WHITEHEAD'S 1991 MODEL WITH DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS TO IDENTIFY CURRENT HEALTH PROMOTION AND RESEARCH ISSUES WITHOUT CHANGING THE RAINBOW MODEL'S INITIAL STRUCTURE. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.","INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND NURSING, HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN, BREMEN, RESEARCH, GERMANY, LEIBNIZ SCIENCECAMPUS DIGITAL PUBLIC HEALTH BREMEN, BREMEN, GERMANY;LEIBNIZ SCIENCECAMPUS DIGITAL PUBLIC HEALTH BREMEN, BREMEN, GERMANY, INSTITUTE FOR PHILOSOPHY, UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN, BREMEN, GERMANY;INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND NURSING, HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN, BREMEN, RESEARCH, GERMANY, LEIBNIZ SCIENCECAMPUS DIGITAL PUBLIC HEALTH BREMEN, BREMEN, GERMANY;LEIBNIZ SCIENCECAMPUS DIGITAL PUBLIC HEALTH BREMEN, BREMEN, GERMANY, INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND NURSING RESEARCH, PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION, UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN, BREMEN, GERMANY","SCHÜZ, B.LEIBNIZ SCIENCECAMPUS DIGITAL PUBLIC HEALTH BREMEN, GERMANY; EMAIL: BENJAMIN.SCHUEZ@UNI-BREMEN.DE","DAHLGREN G, 2007; GRINDLE K, 2021; IBRAHIM H, 2021; WATTS G, 2020; DAHLGREN G, 2021; RICE L, 2019; BUCCI S, 2019; ROY J, 2022; ZOBAIR K, 2020; ERUCHALU C, 2021; KAZEVMAN G, 2021; AZZOPARDI-MUSCAT N, 2019; POOL J, 2020; WILLIAMS A, 2021; MORSE J, 2020; KALISCHKO T, 2021; BORLE P, 2021; FAIRBURN J, 2019; YAO R, 2022; BAUM F, 2014; HONEYMAN M, 2020; GUNASEKERAN D, 2022; NG B, 2021; HAYNES N, 2021; GRIFFITHS F, 2015; DE SANTIS K, 2021; WELCH V, 2016; ANDERSEN M, 2020; WHITEHEAD M, 1991; SOHN S, 2019; MASAELI N, 2022; YANG J, 2020; PATTERSON K, 2022; LIORET S, 2020; CHENG C, 2020; JAISWAL J, 2020; O’NEILL J, 2014; KONTOS E, 2012; ALVAREZ-GALVEZ J, 2020; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; MEDERO K, 2022; CHHIBBER A, 2021; FERGUSON J, 2020; DIDERICHSEN F, 2021; MAANI N, 2020; CINELLI M, 2020",0,2022,NA,2-S2.0-85139463906,SCOPUS,HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN;UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN;HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN;UNIVERSITY OF BREMEN,SCHÜZ;EMAIL: BENJAMIN.SCHUEZ@UNI-BREMEN.DE,NA,"JAHNEL T, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH","JAHNEL T, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH",GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY,10.1177/20552076221129093,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85139463906&DOI=10.1177%2F20552076221129093&PARTNERID=40&MD5=2FB48D4E384F8CEC2E6799BD8104EA12,NA,NA,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC.,BRITISH INSTITUTE OF PERSIAN STUDIES; LEIBNIZ-GEMEINSCHAFT,SCO

AGEING POPULATIONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY NEGLECTED DURING THE TURN TO DIGITALITY AND AI. IN THIS ARTICLE, THE CONCEPT OF AI AGEISM IS PRESENTED TO MAKE A THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION TO HOW THE UNDERSTANDING OF INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION WITHIN THE FIELD OF AI CAN BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE CATEGORY OF AGE. AI AGEISM CAN BE DEFINED AS PRACTICES AND IDEOLOGIES OPERATING WITHIN THE FIELD OF AI, WHICH EXCLUDE, DISCRIMINATE, OR NEGLECT THE INTERESTS, EXPERIENCES, AND NEEDS OF OLDER POPULATION AND CAN BE MANIFESTED IN FIVE INTERCONNECTED FORMS: (1) AGE BIASES IN ALGORITHMS AND DATASETS (TECHNICAL LEVEL), (2) AGE STEREOTYPES, PREJUDICES AND IDEOLOGIES OF ACTORS IN AI (INDIVIDUAL LEVEL), (3) INVISIBILITY OF OLD AGE IN DISCOURSES ON AI (DISCOURSE LEVEL), (4) DISCRIMINATORY EFFECTS OF USE OF AI TECHNOLOGY ON DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS (GROUP LEVEL), (5) EXCLUSION AS USERS OF AI TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES AND PRODUCTS (USER LEVEL).

THIS CHAPTER WILL PRESENT AND DISCUSS THE SOCIAL ASPECTS OF DIGITALIZATION IN TIMES OF COVID-19 FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. IN DOING SO, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE FOLLOWING TWO ASPECTS: (1) INTERACTION AND HANDLING OF DIGITAL INFORMATION PLACE MANY DEMANDS ON INFORMATION USERS AND ON THOSE WHO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. THIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE SINCE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED BY AN INFODEMIC. THIS IS WHERE DIGITAL HEALTH LITERACY COMES IN, WHICH IS THE ABILITY TO FIND, UNDERSTAND, ASSESS, AND APPLY DIGITAL INFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF HEALTH. (2) THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ON HEALTH-RELATED TOPICS IS SOCIALLY UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED IN SOCIETY—BOTH HORIZONTALLY (GENDER, AGE, MIGRATION, PLACE OF RESIDENCE) AND VERTICALLY (SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS).

HOWEVER, EVIDENCE FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE SHOWS THAT THE DIGITAL TRANSITION PROCESS HAS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF IMPLEMENTATION IN EU COUNTRIES. BASED ON THE DESI DATA WE ANALYZED THE EVOLUTION OF THE DIGITAL TRANSITION IN EU MEMBER STATES AND ANSWERED THE QUESTION WHICH MEMBER STATES ARE PERFORMING BEST IN TERMS OF DIGITIZATION AND WHICH ARE THE LEAST PERFORMING ONES, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MACRO-PERSPECTIVE REGARDING THE STRUCTURE OF THE DIGITALIZATION PROCESS. IN THE SECOND PART, THE ANALYSIS FOCUSES ON THE CURRENT TRENDS IN DIGITAL TRANSITION IN FINLAND, SWEDEN, ROMANIA AND BULGARIA, INCLUDING PANDEMIC PERIOD IN ORDER TO SEE ITS IMPACT. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN MEMBER STATES REGARDING THE LEVEL OF DIGITALIZATION. EACH DOMAIN OF DESI IS IMPORTANT, THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GOOD RESULTS IN TWO AREAS BUT HAVE POOR RESULTS IN THE OTHER THREE AND OVERALL THEY OBTAIN A LOW SCORE. THE PANDEMIC HAS SLOWED DOWN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITALIZATION POLICIES. HOWEVER, THERE IS A GOOD IMPROVEMENT REGARDING E-COMMERCE AREA AND NOT ONLY.

HOWEVER, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ADAPT TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS. THIS LEADS TO MARGINALIZATION OF AT-RISK GROUPS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE WIDENING OF THE SO-CALLED DIGITAL DIVIDE. METHODS: BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE, THREE DIMENSIONS HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED TO IDENTIFY THE LEVEL OF INCLUSION OF WEB PORTALS: THE PERCEPTION OF QUALITY, THE PERCEPTION OF USABILITY, AND THE IMPORTANCE ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR CONTENT. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN DATA ON EACH OF THESE DIMENSIONS, A STUDY WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE USER TEST METHODOLOGY AS A CENTRAL ELEMENT (IDENTIFYING AND EVALUATING 11 VULNERABLE GROUPS) AND, IN PARALLEL, A SURVEY OF THE GENERAL POPULATION AND HEURISTIC TESTS. RESULTS: A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE AT RISK OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION ARE NOT RECEIVING ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE DUE TO THE DIGITALIZATION OF THE SYSTEM AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SCARCELY INCLUSIVE HEALTH WEB PORTALS, WHICH POSE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS IN SERVICE PROVISION FOR THE 11 SELECTED COLLECTIVES. MEANWHILE, THE GENERAL POPULATION IS BEING INTRODUCED TO EHEALTH BENEFITS, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER DID NOT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF DIGITIZATION OR A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES. CONCLUSIONS: THE GENERAL POPULATION HAS A RELATIVELY POSITIVE PERSPECTIVE OF EHEALTH SERVICES, BUT ONLY A MINORITY OF THEM MAKE INTENSIVE USE OF THEM, AND THEY ARE NOT WIDESPREAD IN SPAIN AS A WHOLE. MEANWHILE, THE POPULATION AT RISK OF EXCLUSION LACKS THE SKILLS AND RESOURCES TO MAKE REAL USE OF EHEALTH, NEEDING “DIGITAL INTERMEDIARIES” FROM THE SOCIAL SPHERE TO ACHIEVE RESULTS. EHEALTH POLICIES ARE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PEOPLE WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF MARGINALIZATION, AGGRAVATING THEIR EXCLUSION AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.","DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, POLITICAL, SCIENCE AND ADMINISTRATION, AND PHILOSOPHY, UNIVERSITY OF VIGO, PONTEVEDRA, SPAIN;DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND SOCIOLOGY, FACULTY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE AND ADMINISTRATION, UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, SPAIN;DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, POLITICAL, SCIENCE AND ADMINISTRATION, AND PHILOSOPHY, UNIVERSITY OF VIGO, PONTEVEDRA, SPAIN","FERNÁNDEZ DA SILVA, Á.; DEPARTMENT OF SOCIOLOGY, SPAIN; EMAIL: ANGELA.FERNANDEZ@UVIGO.ES","CERNADAS A, 2020; COLOM C, 2020; NORRIS P, 2001; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; ANDREASSON K, 2015, DOI 10.1201/b17986; VARELA J, 2015; MENOU M, 2004; WILCHES-FLÓREZ O, 2017; GONZÁLEZ M, 2013; BORRELL C, 2008; BARRAL B, 2021; PÉREZ MD F, 2010; SEN A, 2001; WHITEHEAD M, 2006; SEN A, 1993; AUTRY A, 2011; ALMENARA J C, 2017; ARCAYA M, 2015; GORSKI P, 2005; WEI L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/15205431003642707; MARMOT M, 2012; SINGH G, 1969; TOLOSANA E, 2018; WESSELS B, 2013; TOBOSO M, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10676-010-9254-2; SALAMI B, NA; VÁZQUEZ Á, 2019; TRAVIESO J, 2008; LAZAR M, 2018; HALL A, 2015; CORSCADDEN L, 2019; MUELA A, 2020; SHEVCHUK O, 2018; VAN BOEKEL L, 2013; BEATTIE T, 2020; BAKER L, 2003; FERRER F, 2003; MARTÍNEZ-FRÍAS M, 1992; SERRANO MASCARAQUE E, 2009; PERURENA CANCIO L, 2013; BOULOS M, NA; CARRIÓN R, 2014; NEWMAN G, 2010; NIELSEN J, 1994; MAGUIRE M, 2001; BOUZAS-LORENZO R, 2013; KARKIN N, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2013.11.004; GARCÍA-LACALLE J, 2011; LÓPEZ-GIL J, 2010; ENCABO S, 2017; HASSAN Y, 2003; MORALES VARGAS A, NA; CODINA BONILLA L, 2016; MARCOS M, NA; FERNANDEZ A, 2011; WELLE DONKER-KUIJER M, 2010; BANGOR A, 2009; DUMAS J, 1999; GOODMAN KUNIAVSKY M, 2019; GANT J, 2002; NIELSEN J, 2006; MAHOU-LAGO X, 2016; LUCHENSKI S, 2018; LUPIÁÑEZ-VILLANUEVA F, 2010; FITZPATRICK S, 2013; FUNDACIÓN C, 2021; BAS-SARMIENTO P, 2015; LLOP-GIRONÉS A, 2014; MAYORGA C, 2012; BARRAL B, NA; PERONA I, 2019; DEL CAMPO S, 2021; MORGAN C, 2007; RODRÍGUEZ-PELLEJERO J, 2017; CALVO GARCÍA F, 2019; FUNDACIÓN F, 2014; DE LA RICA S, 2019; FUNDACIÓN F, 2019",0,2022,NA,2-S2.0-85136226171,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY OF VIGO;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA;UNIVERSITY OF VIGO,NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"FERNÁNDEZ DA SILVA Á, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH","FERNÁNDEZ DA SILVA Á, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH",SPAIN;SPAIN;SPAIN,10.1177/20552076221120724,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85136226171&DOI=10.1177%2F20552076221120724&PARTNERID=40&MD5=87607C8D80EDA4357144456DEF7D9DEB,NA,NA,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC.,MINISTERIO DE ECONOMÍA Y COMPETITIVIDAD,SCO

ASKED ON THEIR GENERAL PERCEPTION, 53.18% OF THE RESPONDENTS RATED THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE AS POSITIVE OR VERY POSITIVE, BUT ONLY 4.77% NEGATIVE OR VERY NEGATIVE. THE RESPONDENTS DENIED CONCERNS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, BUT STRONGLY AGREED THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MUST BE CONTROLLED BY A PHYSICIAN. OLDER PATIENTS, WOMEN, PERSONS WITH LOWER EDUCATION AND TECHNICAL AFFINITY WERE MORE CAUTIOUS ON THE HEALTHCARE-RELATED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE USAGE. CONCLUSIONS: GERMAN PATIENTS AND THEIR COMPANIONS ARE OPEN TOWARDS THE USAGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTHCARE. ALTHOUGH SHOWING ONLY A MEDIOCRE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, A MAJORITY RATED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HEALTHCARE AS POSITIVE. PARTICULARLY, PATIENTS INSIST THAT A PHYSICIAN SUPERVISES THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND KEEPS ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY. © THE AUTHOR(S) 2022.","DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY, SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY, JUELICH SUPERCOMPUTING CENTRE, FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY, SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY, SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY, SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY;SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY, DEPARTMENT OF ANESTHESIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF ANESTHESIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY;SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY, JUELICH SUPERCOMPUTING CENTRE, FORSCHUNGSZENTRUM JUELICH, GERMANY, FACULTY OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING, MECHANICAL, ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF ICELAND, ICELAND;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY, SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY;DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN, GERMANY, SMITH CONSORTIUM OF THE GERMAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS INITIATIVE, GERMANY","FRITSCH, S.J.; DEPARTMENT OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, GERMANY; EMAIL: SFRITSCH@UKAACHEN.DE","MCCRADDEN M, 2020; FAST E, 2017; KAPLAN A, 2019; MADDOX T, 2019; KULKARNI S, 2020; NOORBAKHSH-SABET N, 2019; LAURITZEN A, 2022; RICHARDSON J, 2021; MESKO B, 2020; SCOTT I, 2021; SUNARTI S, 2021; MAASSEN O, 2021; LAÏ M, 2020; CASTAGNO S, 2020; KLEINSINGER F, 2003; GUO Y, 2020; SECINARO S, 2021; SREEDHARAN S, 2020; YIN J, 2021; NAGENDRAN M, 2020; AGGARWAL R, 2021; LENNARTZ S, 2021; PALMISCIANO P, 2020; YORK T, 2020; YOKOI R, 2021; LONGONI C, 2019; PROMBERGER M, 2006; BIGMAN Y, 2018; SISK B, 2020; TRAN V, 2019; NELSON C, 2020; ESMAEILZADEH P, 2020; ESMAEILZADEH P, 2021; ZHANG Z, 2021; MEYER A, 2020; HAGGENMÜLLER S, 2021; PLOUG T, 2021; GAO S, 2020; ANDRADE C, 2020; THIEL R, 2019; KUHN A, 2016; HANSEN A, 2019; SHARMA A, 2021; PINTO DOS SANTOS D, 2019; HAAN M, 2019; LIYANAGE H, 2019; HENGSTLER M, 2016; PERNEGER T, 2015; RATTRAY J, 2007; BARTLETT J, 2001; HIBBARD J, NA; TENZER F, 2010; HEIDEL A, 2020; DE SANTIS K, 2021; ERNSTING C, 2017; RASCHE P, 2018; COOPER I, 2016; STÜRZ R, 2020; OH S, 2019; SCHEETZ J, 2021; GRUNHUT J, 2021; KUNDU S, 2021; CORNEJO MULLER A, 2020; SAFI S, 2019; ANTES A, 2021; MERKEL S, 2020; GRILL E, 2021; BÆRØE K, 2022; SMITH H, 2021; WGERKE S, 2020; SURESH H, 2021; VAN DE SANDE D, 2022; SUBRAMANIAN M, 2021",1,2022,NA,2-S2.0-85136180467,SCOPUS,UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY OF ICELAND;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN;UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL RWTH AACHEN,FRITSCH;NOTREPORTED;EMAIL: SFRITSCH@UKAACHEN.DE,NA,"FRITSCH SJ, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH","FRITSCH SJ, 2022, DIGIT HEALTH",GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;GERMANY;ICELAND,10.1177/20552076221116772,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85136180467&DOI=10.1177%2F20552076221116772&PARTNERID=40&MD5=5FFE67E1FFB89D75B62D4FCAD91CA4FE,NA,NA,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC.,BUNDESMINISTERIUM FÜR BILDUNG UND FORSCHUNG,SCO

IT CAN BE DEFINED AS A GAP BETWEEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS REGARDING THE ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES TO ICT AND THE INTERNET USE FOR DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES. THE GOAL OF THE STUDY IS TO IDENTIFY THE LINK BETWEEN THE REGIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN UKRAINE AND GENERALIZE INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES OF DIGITALIZATION PROMOTION IN LAGGING REGIONS. METHODOLOGICALLY, VARIOUS STATISTICAL METHODS (ANALYTICAL GROUPING, VARIATION, AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS) WERE USED. THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND AVAILABLE DATA FOR ASSESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE REFERRED TO THE STATE STATISTICAL SERVICE OF UKRAINE'S SURVEY ON INTERNET USERS IN UKRAINIAN REGIONS. THE STUDY REVEALED AN OVERALL SHRINK IN THE VARIATION COEFFICIENT OF THE SHARE OF INTERNET USERS (FROM 36.4% IN 2010 TO 10.2% IN 2019). HOWEVER, THE VARIATION COEFFICIENTS FOR THE SHARE OF INTERACTING WITH PUBLIC AUTHORITIES, READING ONLINE, AND E-MAILING PERSONS REMAIN SIGNIFICANT. FURTHERMORE, ANALYTICAL GROUPING OF REGIONS SUGGESTED THAT THE LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT INFLUENCED THE PENETRATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES INTO PUBLIC LIFE VASTLY, THOUGH SEVERAL UNACCOUNTED FACTORS ALSO EXISTED. FINALLY, THE PAPER EXAMINED INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES OF MANAGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. AS A RESULT, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PUBLIC POLICY (E.G., THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR LATE ADULTS AND ELDERLY, IMPROVED DIGITAL MAINTENANCE AND DIGITALIZATION PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS, PRICE EQUALIZATION FOR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, EQUAL INTERNET PROVISION IN DIFFERENT REGIONS, AND INVESTMENTS IN SERVICES DIGITALIZATION) WERE DEVELOPED. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S).","DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY, STATE ORGANIZATION 'INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND FORECASTING OF NASU,', UKRAINE;DEPARTMENT OF CUSTOMS AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF STATE FISCAL SERVICE OF UKRAINE (STATE TAX UNIVERSITY), UKRAINE;MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT, WYZSZA SZKOŁA EKONOMICZNO-HUMANISTYCZNA, POLAND;DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY, STATE ORGANIZATION 'INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND FORECASTING OF NASU,', UKRAINE;INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, KING DANYLO UNIVERSITY, UKRAINE","TSYPLITSKA, O.; DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY, UKRAINE","BEYNON-DAVIES P, 2007; CHAKRAVORTI B, 2020; CHMERUK G, 2018; DEINEKO L, 2020; DEINEKO L, 2020; DING C, 2022; GILLWALD A, 2018; HIDALGO A, 2020; KERRAS H, 2020; KOLODIZIEV O, 2018; KURODA R, 2019; LIM K, 2019; MWIN E, 2016; MYEONG S, 2014; NEAGU G, 2021; NEKRASOV V, 2018; PAGAN F J B, 2018; RAJNAI Z, 2017; SHEN F, 2020; SHIRAZI F, 2021; SONG Z, 2019; SRINUAN C, 2011; STOICIU A, 2011; THONIPARA A, 2020; ZHANG B, 2018; ZHAROVA L, 2019",0,2022,NA,2-S2.0-85129460508,SCOPUS,STATE ORGANIZATION 'INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND FORECASTING OF NASU;UNIVERSITY OF STATE FISCAL SERVICE OF UKRAINE (STATE TAX UNIVERSITY);STATE ORGANIZATION 'INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND FORECASTING OF NASU;KING DANYLO UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED,NA,"DEINEKO L, 2022, PROBL PERSPECT MANAGE","DEINEKO L, 2022, PROBL PERSPECT MANAGE",POLAND;UKRAINE;UKRAINE;UKRAINE;UKRAINE,10.21511/ppm.20(1).2022.29,HTTPS://WWW.SCOPUS.COM/INWARD/RECORD.URI?EID=2-S2.0-85129460508&DOI=10.21511%2FPPM.20%281%29.2022.29&PARTNERID=40&MD5=FB29D3A8626DF4A216421A0698427112,NA,NA,LLC CPC BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES,NA,SCO

IN EFFECT, THE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE SECTOR POSE AN EVEN GREATER CHALLENGE TO ACHIEVE EQUALIZING THE ROLE OF WOMEN TO THAT OF MEN IN THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR. THE LIMITATION OF THE FEMALE GENDER TO TRAINING AND EMPOWERMENT PREVENTS THEM FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A WORLD FREE OF HUNGER AND MALNUTRITION, WHICH IS ONE OF THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDG).

IT IS JUSTIFIED THAT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS CAUSED BY COVID-19 IN 2020 LEVELED THE EFFORTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN COUNTRIES. A WAY OUT OF THIS SITUATION IS SEEN IN OPERATING A POLICY OF MULTILATERALISM, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF STATES WITH DIGITAL LAGGING, AS WELL AS IN REFORMING THE SYSTEM OF WTO AGREEMENTS, WHICH SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEED TO EXPAND THE SPACE FOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY.
