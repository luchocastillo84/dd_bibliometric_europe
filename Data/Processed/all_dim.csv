GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES TO WIDEN PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION MEAN THAT STUDENTS FROM HITHERTO NON‐TRADITIONAL BACKGROUNDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE USING LIBRARIES THAN PREVIOUSLY. THAT THE MUCH DISCUSSED “DIGITAL DIVIDE” IS INDEED A REALITY, IS CONFIRMED BY THE AUTHOR’S OWN RECENT RESEARCH, “BARRIERS TO LIBRARIES AS AGENTS OF LIFELONG LEARNING”, CONDUCTED AT A UK UNIVERSITY AND TWO FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES. SOCIAL CLASS AND HOME ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ARE SHOWN AS DIVIDERS IMPACTING ON THE EXTENT OF USE OF ALL SERVICES OFFERED BY THE LEARNING RESOURCE CENTRE. IN THE EDUCATION OF FUTURE LIBRARIANS, THE NEED FOR GREATER SENSITIVITY TO CLIENT GROUP CHARACTERISTICS AND AN ENHANCEMENT OF GOOD INTERPERSONAL SKILLS IS INDICATED.","TEESSIDE UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","TEESSIDE UNIVERSITY,UNITED KINGDOM","LINE M, 1998, DOI 10.1108/eb051500; PHIPPS L, 2000, DOI 10.1080/136911800359419; LUNDEBERG J, 1995, DOI 10.1016/s0167-7799(00)88893-9; CROW B, 2000, DOI 10.1080/13621020050078096",8,2001,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1046505748,ISI,TEESSIDE UNIVERSITY,TEESSIDE UNIVERSITY,NA,"HULL B, 2001, NEW LIBRARY WORLD","HULL B, 2001, NEW LIBRARY WORLD",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/eum0000000006066,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1046505748,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE UK WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY. THE TARGETS SET BY GOVERNMENT ARE OFTEN VAGUE, AND FEW GOVERNMENTS SEEM TO HAVE ADDRESSED IN ANY THOUGHTFUL MANNER THE PROBLEMS CITIZENS MIGHT HAVE WITH USE OF TECHNOLOGY. AN APPROACH ALONG THE LINES OF ‘THIS IS BOUND TO HAPPEN’ RATHER THAN ‘WHAT SORT OF SOCIETY DO WE REALLY WANT?’ IS A COMMON FEATURE AMONGST ALL THE APPROACHES EXAMINED. THE RISKS OF ENHANCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE ALSO RARELY EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED. COMMENTS REGARDING GOOD INITIATIVES THAT OFFER MODELS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES TO ADOPT ARE MADE. THE EMERGENCE OF GOVERNMENT PORTALS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT. THESE PROVIDE THE FACILITY FOR PERSONALIZATION BY THE USER. THE NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT’S EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT ITS WEB SITES ARE USEFUL FOR CITIZENS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY SPELLING AND THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT’S USE OF MINORITY LANGUAGES ARE ALSO NOTEWORTHY.

CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IS REPRESENTED BY THE TECHNOLOGY OPTIMISTS' VIEW THAT THE DIVIDE IS CAUSED BY SOCIETAL BARRIERS TO INTERNET CONNECTIVITY SUCH AS LOW LEVELS OF EDUCATION, INCOME AND PROLIFERATION OF TECHNOLOGY. THE TECHNOLOGY PESSIMISTS DISAGREE THAT THESE BARRIERS CAUSE THE DIVIDE OR THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURE BY GOVERNMENT. THIS PAPER REPORTS ON A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE VALIDITY OF THE OPTIMISTIC POSITION. THE ISLE OF MAN (IOM) WAS SELECTED FOR THIS EVALUATION BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE, SOCIAL STABILITY, HIGH LEVELS OF EDUCATION AND INCOME AND ESTABLISHED E-GOVERNMENT PROGRAMME. THE PREMISE OF THE RESEARCH WAS THAT IF THE OPTIMISTIC VIEW IS CORRECT, LOWER OR SIMILAR BARRIERS TO THOSE FOUND IN THE UK SHOULD RESULT IN HIGHER OR SIMILAR LEVELS OF INTERNET ACCESS IN THE IOM. PRIME CAUSAL FACTORS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, AS PURPORTED BY THE OPTIMISTS, WERE FOUND TO MARGINALLY FAVOUR THE IOM. HOWEVER, THE TEST OF INTERNET ACCESS REVEALED THAT THE IOM TRAILED THE UK CONNECTIVITY LEVEL BY SOME 12% TO 14%, WHICH IS NOT AS EXPECTED FROM THE OPTIMISTIC VIEWPOINT. THIS UNEXPECTED OUTCOME COULD CONSTITUTE A DILEMMA FOR THE IOM GOVERNMENT IN ADOPTING AN APPROPRIATE STRATEGY TO E-GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND NARROWING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

MANY GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS NOW EITHER OWN OR SPONSOR ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES. THE AIMS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN CREATING E‐MARKETPLACES ARE OFTEN MOTIVATED BY REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. WHILST GOVERNMENT ENTITIES MAY THINK E‐MARKETPLACES ARE AN EFFECTIVE CHANNEL FOR IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENT POLICY, A NUMBER OF COMPLICATIONS CAN ARISE FROM THIS MODEL. DESPITE THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT MOTIVATION, A MAJOR ARGUMENT FOR E‐MARKETPLACE DEVELOPMENT BEING PUT FORWARD IS THE ECONOMIC ONE AND THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A NARROW VIEW OF THE E‐MARKETPLACE CONCEPT AND ONE, WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING AT LEAST, IS LIKELY TO RESTRICT ITS IMPACT.

A FRAMEWORK IS PRESENTED TO ASSIST IN ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF DIGITAL DIVIDES AND OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH, POLICY AND PRACTICE AFFECTED BY THE DESIGN AND USE OF BROADBAND INTERNET AND RELATED ICTS.","UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, UNITED KINGDOM;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNITED STATES;SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY, UNITED STATES;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,UNITED KINGDOM","WILLIAMS R, 1996, DOI 10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2; DUTTON W, 1992, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1992.tb00046.x; BLUMENTHAL M, 2001, DOI 10.1145/383034.383037; CLARK D, 2003, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.372260",48,2004,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1031322946,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,NA,"DUTTON WH, 2004, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","DUTTON WH, 2004, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY",UNITED KINGDOM; USA; USA,10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000007,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1031322946,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON AND WHAT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN THEM, CONSIDERING THE 150‐YEAR TIME DIFFERENCE IN THEIR OCCURRENCE? AS TIME PASSES, CAN INTERNET DEVELOPERS LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE RAILWAY INDUSTRY?   FINDINGS THE TWO INDUSTRIES HAVE A LOT OF COMMON. BOTH RAILWAYS AND THE INTERNET REPRESENT NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURES THAT CANNOT BE MANAGED JUST BASED ON BUSINESS MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES. AS BOTH ARE CONCERNED WITH TRAFFIC, EITHER THAT OF PHYSICAL GOODS OR OF MESSAGES, THE TWO INDUSTRIES ALSO SEEM TO HAVE A LOT IN TECHNICAL TERMS WHEN ONE TAKES A SUFFICIENTLY ABSTRACT POINT OF VIEW. THE MAIN MESSAGE IS THAT IN THE LONG TERM, THE RAILWAY REVOLUTION VANISHED AND THE INDUSTRY TURNED INTO A LOW PROFIT/INTEREST FIELD. THE INTERNET MIGHT FOLLOW THE SAME PATH.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER IN ITS CURRENT FORM IS BASED ON A LITERATURE REVIEW ONLY. ITS QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED WITH A DETAILED EMPIRICAL STUDY. OTHER SIMILAR INFRASTRUCTURE‐TYPE INDUSTRIES COULD ALSO BE INVOLVED.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE INTERNET, BUT THEY ARE LARGE‐SCALE ISSUES NEEDING CO‐OPERATION BETWEEN THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INTERNET. EXAMPLES ARE THOSE OF AVOIDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND CATERING FOR CRITICAL “LAST MILE” CONNECTIONS, AS WELL AS MANAGING THE DIVERSITY OF DIFFERENT STANDARDS.

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A BIBLIOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND DISTINGUISHED BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND FRENCH STUDIES. RESULTS: FOR A LONG TIME, THE (MOSTLY US) STUDIES HAVE BEEN MERELY DESCRIPTIVE. THE STUDIES HIGHLIGHT THAT THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH SEARCHES ON THE INTERNET ARE SIMILAR TO THE FACTORS UNDERLYING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. CONSUMER SEARCHES ARE DEEMED EFFICIENT ALTHOUGH SEARCH SKILLS ARE COMPARATIVELY BELOW STANDARD. ATTEMPTS ARE UNDERWAY TO SET UP TOOLS, CIRCULATE THEM WIDELY, AND ENSURE BETTER QUALITY INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET. HOWEVER, COMPREHENSION AND LITERACY ARE STILL ISSUES IN SOME SOCIAL GROUPS. REGARDING THE IMPACT ON CONSUMER HEALTH PER SE, A (POSITIVE) EFFECT OF THE INTERNET SEEMS TO EMERGE BUT RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONTINUED. CONCLUSION: MANY OF THE BEHAVIORS, USES OR LIMITS ADDRESSED IN THIS PAPER PERTAIN TO ANY INFORMATION SEARCH ON THE INTERNET BUT OTHER PROBLEMS OR DIFFERENCES ALSO OCCUR IN THE SPECIFIC AREA OF HEALTH. LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE NEEDED, SPECIFICALLY TO GAIN DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACTS WE HAVE ADDRESSED, WHILE ROLLING OUT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF USER PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES. SPECIFICALLY, THE CENTRAL ISSUE IS STILL TO DETERMINE HOW (AND FOR WHOM) THE INTERNET ALTERS INFORMATION SEARCH BEHAVIORS AND, IN FINE, TO WHAT EXTENT THIS AFFECTS HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND THE RECOURSE TO HEALTHCARE.","INSERM, FRANCE;SORBONNE UNIVERSITY, FRANCE;INSERM, FRANCE;SORBONNE UNIVERSITY, FRANCE","INSERM,FRANCE","KIRK S, 2003, DOI 10.1186/1472-6963-3-19; SKINNER H, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00455-0; EYSENBACH G, 2003, DOI 10.3322/canjclin.53.6.356; JOUBERT M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.04.022; COTTEN S, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.02.020; EYSENBACH G, 2002, DOI 10.1136/bmj.324.7337.573; KLEMM P, 2003, DOI 10.1097/00024665-200305000-00010; EYSENBACH G, 2004, DOI 10.1136/bmj.328.7449.1166; EYSENBACH G, 2000, DOI 10.1136/bmj.320.7251.1713; ZIEBLAND S, 2004, DOI 10.1136/bmj.328.7439.564; EYSENBACH G, 2004, DOI 10.1001/jama.291.24.2946; HARDEY M, 1999, DOI 10.1111/1467-9566.00185; BORZEKOWSKI D, 2001, DOI 10.1001/archpedi.155.7.813; EYSENBACH G, 2002, DOI 10.1001/jama.287.20.2691; FOX N, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.07.005; PETERSON M, 2003, DOI 10.1378/chest.123.2.452; NGUYEN H, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0010-4825(03)00046-5; BESSELL T, 2002, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-842x.2002.tb00912.x; BORZEKOWSKI D, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0193-3973(00)00065-4; PANDEY S, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00019-9; CASHEN M, 2004, DOI 10.1097/00005082-200405000-00010; NAHM E, 2004, DOI 10.1097/00024665-200411000-00007; HENWOOD F, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1467-9566.00360; KALICHMAN S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0738-3991(01)00134-3; SOUALMIA L, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2004.05.012; ANDERSON J, 2003, DOI 10.1023/a:1021061229743; GIVRON P, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.annrmp.2004.03.001; GRAY N, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s1054-139x(02)00616-x; CHRISTENSEN H, 2004, DOI 10.1136/bmj.37945.566632.ee; ZIEBLAND S, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.02.019; EYSENBACH G, 1999, DOI 10.1136/bmj.319.7220.1294; TATE D, 2003, DOI 10.1001/jama.289.14.1833; VULLIET-TAVERNIER S, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s1246-7391(02)83002-0; HÜFKEN V, 2004, DOI 10.1007/s00038-004-3149-0; MORAHAN-MARTIN J, 2004, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2004.7.497; ANDERSON J, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0894439303262671; PITTS V, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1363459304038794; LICCIARDONE J, 2001, DOI 10.2196/jmir.3.4.e31; HOUSTON T, 2002, DOI 10.2196/jmir.4.2.e7; FOGEL J, 2002, DOI 10.2196/jmir.4.2.e9; CLARKE G, 2002, DOI 10.2196/jmir.4.3.e14; DUTTA-BERGMAN M, 2003, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5.3.e21; KOO M, 2003, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5.4.e28; SKINNER H, 2003, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5.4.e32; PETERSON G, 2003, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5.4.e33; DUTTA-BERGMAN M, 2004, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.2.e15; ZENG X, 2004, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.2.e19; BIRRU M, 2004, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.3.e25; HART A, 2004, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.3.e36; WANTLAND D, 2004, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.4.e40; VERHEIJDEN M, 2004, DOI 10.2196/jmir.6.4.e44; NABARETTE H, 2002, DOI 10.3917/res.114.0249; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; HARGRAVE D, 2003; JEANNOT J, 2004; CALDERÓN J, 2004",53,2006,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HEALTH SERVICES AND SYSTEMS; HEALTH SCIENCES,PUB.1049918648,ISI,SORBONNE UNIVERSITY;SORBONNE UNIVERSITY,NOTREPORTED,NA,"RENAHY E, 2006, REVUE D'EPIDÉMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTÉ PUBLIQUE","RENAHY E, 2006, REVUE D'EPIDÉMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTÉ PUBLIQUE",FRANCE; FRANCE,10.1016/s0398-7620(06)76721-9,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1049918648,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE RAFT PROJECT WAS STARTED IN WESTERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES 5 YEARS AGO AND HAS NOW EXTENDED TO OTHER REGIONS OF AFRICA AS WELL (I.E. MADAGASCAR, RWANDA). A PROJECT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL TELE-MEDICINE NETWORK IN MALI WAS INITIATED IN 2001, EXTENDED TO MAURITANIA IN 2002 AND TO MOROCCO IN 2003. BY 2006, A TOTAL OF NINE COUNTRIES ARE CONNECTED. THE ENTIRE TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS BASED ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES FOR MEDICAL DISTANCE LEARNING AND TELE-CONSULTATIONS. THE RESULTS ARE A TELE-MEDICINE NETWORK THAT HAS BEEN IN PRODUCTIVE USE FOR OVER 5 YEARS AND HAS ENABLED VARIOUS COLLABORATION CHANNELS, INCLUDING NORTH-TO-SOUTH (FROM EUROPE TO AFRICA), SOUTH-TO-SOUTH (WITHIN AFRICA), AND SOUTH-TO-NORTH (FROM AFRICA TO EUROPE) DISTANCE LEARNING AND TELE-CONSULTATIONS, PLUS MANY PERSONAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND UNIVERSITIES. IT HAS ALSO UNVEILED A SET OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS: (A) THE LIMITED IMPORTANCE OF NORTH-TO-SOUTH COLLABORATIONS WHEN THERE ARE MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES OR THE SOCIO-CULTURAL CONTEXTS BETWEEN THE COLLABORATING PARTIES; (B) THE RISK OF AN INDUCED DIGITAL DIVIDE IF THE PERIPHERY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK; AND (C) THE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL MEDICAL CONTENT MANAGEMENT SKILLS. PARTICULARLY POINT (C) IS IMPROVED THROUGH THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES AS PROFESSIONALS FROM THE MEDICAL AND THE COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD ARE SHARING COURSES AND RESOURCES. PERSONAL EXCHANGES BETWEEN PARTNERS IN THE PROJECT ARE FREQUENT, AND SEVERAL PERSONS RECEIVED AN EDUCATION AT ONE OF THE PARTNER UNIVERSITIES. AS CONCLUSION, WE CAN SAY THAT THE IDENTIFIED RISKS HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DESIGNING LARGE-SCALE TELE-MEDICINE PROJECTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE MITIGATED BY FOSTERING SOUTH-SOUTH COLLABORATION CHANNELS, BY THE USE OF SATELLITE-BASED INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IN REMOTE AREAS, THE APPRECIATION OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND ITS PUBLICATION ON-LINE.

(2) THE VERY CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBILITY, IF TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND APPLIED RESPONSIBLY (HERE CALLED REFLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY) REQUIRES A PARTICIPATIVE APPROACH THAT CONTRADICTS THE TRADITIONAL TOP-DOWN APPROACH OF HEROIC MANAGEMENT.

THERE IS A RISK THAT MARGINALIZED GROUPS IN DEPRIVED AREAS MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM THE INFORMATION SOCIETY, BEING AFFECTED BY THE ‘DUAL DIGITAL DIVIDE’. THIS PAPER CONCERNS TWO COMMUNITY INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE DIGITAL AND SOCIAL INCLUSION IN A DISADVANTAGED AREA: A LOCAL NET AND AN IT-CAFÉ. A COMBINATION OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM A CASE STUDY IN A SUBURB OF STOCKHOLM IS USED TO EXAMINE THE TWO SCHEMES IN TERMS OF THEIR SUCCESS IN BRIDGING THE DUAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. DESPITE GOOD INTENTIONS, THE LOCAL NET, WITH ITS PROVISION OF HOME ACCESS TO LOCAL WEB PAGES, LARGELY FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS. IN CONTRAST, THE IT-CAFÉ, WITH ITS PUBLIC ACCESS TO ICTS, HAS INCREASED DIGITAL AND SOCIAL INCLUSION OF THOSE RESIDENTS WHO MAKE USE OF IT. SIX REASONS FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN SUCCESS BETWEEN THE TWO COMPUTER PROJECTS ARE IDENTIFIED: (1) TIMING, (2) MANAGEMENT, (3) COST, (4) SUPPORT AND TRAINING, (5) CONTEXT OF ACCESS AND (6) PROJECT FOCUS. THE PROVISION OF SUBSIDIZED PUBLIC ACCESS, THE INFORMAL FACE-TO-FACE COMPUTER SUPPORT AND TRAINING PROVIDED BY A LOCAL RESIDENT WORKING IN THE IT-CAFÉ, AND THE EASE WITH WHICH BOTH VIRTUAL AND PHYSICAL MEETINGS CAN BE SUPPORTED ARE FACTORS UNDERLYING THE SUCCESS OF THE IT-CAFÉ. THE PAPER CONCLUDES THAT ACCESS, SKILLS AND MOTIVATION ARE PREREQUISITES FOR A DIGITALLY INCLUSIVE SOCIETY. TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE (DUAL) DIGITAL DIVIDE IT IS VITAL TO HAVE PHYSICAL ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGIES, BUT ALSO TO HAVE THE SKILLS AND MOTIVATION TO USE THEM.","SÖDERTÖRN UNIVERSITY, SWEDEN;SÖDERTÖRN UNIVERSITY, SWEDEN;E-MAIL:, D.W.Q.TIMMS@STIR.AC.UK, SWEDEN","SÖDERTÖRN UNIVERSITY,SWEDEN","LIFF S, 2001, DOI 10.1080/713768550; DE CINDIO F, 2003, DOI 10.1080/714044686; CARROLL J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/714044685; MESCH G, 2003, DOI 10.1046/j.1535-6841.2003.00059.x; LIFF S, 2003, DOI 10.1177/14614448030053001; FERLANDER S, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00018-6; KAVANAUGH A, 2002, DOI 10.1002/9780470774298.ch11; KUBICEK H, 2002, DOI 10.1080/13691180210159274; WAKEFORD N, 2003, DOI 10.1177/14614448030053005; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; UOTINEN J, 2003, DOI 10.1177/14614448030053003; HAMPTON K, 2003, DOI 10.1080/714044688; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309490; BLANCHARD A, 1998, DOI 10.1177/089443939801600306; CRUMP B, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i12.1106; CASTELLS M, 2002, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199255771.001.0001; WELLMAN B, 2002, DOI 10.1002/9780470774298",18,2006,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1005544128,ISI,SÖDERTÖRN UNIVERSITY;SÖDERTÖRN UNIVERSITY,SÖDERTÖRN UNIVERSITY,NA,"FERLANDER S, 2006, INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY","FERLANDER S, 2006, INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY",SWEDEN,10.1080/13691180600630732,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1005544128,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

THE PURPOSE OF THIS CURRENT STUDY IS TO ARGUE THAT THE ADOPTION OF E‐BUSINESS PRACTICES HAS BENEFIT FOR SMALL GHANAIAN EXPORTERS' ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENT, AND BEGIN A FIRST‐LEVEL INVESTIGATION IN THAT REGARD.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS STUDY WAS EXPLORATORY AND FOCUSED ON A SAMPLE OF ACTIVE, NON‐TRADITIONAL EXPORTERS IN ACCRA. THIS SAMPLE REPRESENTED THE BEST TYPOLOGY OF SMALL EXPORT FIRMS IN GHANA THAT HAD BEEN REGULAR EXPORTERS FROM 2000‐2004. IN ALL, 60 FIRMS RESPONDED TO QUESTIONNAIRES ON E‐BUSINESS AND EXPORTING. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA WAS MAINLY BY MEANS OF DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS.   FINDINGS ONE‐WAY ANOVA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EXPORT FIRM INTERNATIONALIZATION (MEASURED BY EXPORT INTENSITY) HAS NO BEARING ON THE LEVEL OF E‐BUSINESS INVOLVEMENT OR PERCEPTIONS OF THE STRATEGIC VALUE OF E‐BUSINESS. HOWEVER, EXPORT FIRMS WHO WERE MORE INVOLVED IN E‐BUSINESS HAD A HIGHER PERCEPTION OF THE USEFULNESS OF E‐BUSINESS TO THEIR EXPORT OPERATION.

THIS PAPER GIVES A SHORT HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND SOME INSIGHT INTO THE PRESENT DIALECTIC PROCESS BETWEEN AUTONOMY AND THE UPCOMING ISSUE OF EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS. A RECENTLY CONDUCTED EVALUATION PROJECT IN CARINTHIA/AUSTRIA, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED AS REPRESENTATIVE FOR RELATED CURRENT STUDIES IN AUSTRIA, IS PRESENTED. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT. IT PERFECTLY FITS THE ONGOING SHIFT FROM INPUT ORIENTATION TO OUTPUT MEASURING. WHEREAS OTHER TRADITIONAL SUBJECTS AS (FOREIGN) LANGUAGES OR MATHEMATICS ARE BASED ON SOLID, HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED FUNDAMENTS, THE COMPARATIVELY NEW FIELD OF INFORMATICS AT SCHOOLS IS STILL LOOKING FOR STABLE FRAMEWORKS. CONSIDERING THE NEWEST DEVELOPMENTS, WE CAN BE OPTIMISTIC TO ACHIEVE A REASONABLE SOLUTION FOR IMPROVING INFORMATICS EDUCATION AT LOWER SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN AUSTRIA.

HOWEVER, RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THROUGH THE PAST TEN YEARS MORE AND MORE OLDER PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO LEARN HOW TO USE COMPUTERS AND, OF COURSE, HOW TO USE THE INTERNET. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE AND ANALYSE INTERNET USAGE AMONG SENIORS ON THE BASIS OF A CASE STUDY SHOWING THE ACTUAL SITUATION IN SLOVENIA. A SURVEY WAS CARRIED OUT AMONG SENIORS, THE PARTICIPANTS OF DIFFERENT THIRD AGE UNIVERSITY PROGRAMMES, BY USING A QUESTIONNAIRE, DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY. THIS PARTICULAR GROUP OF SENIORS WAS CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY LEAD MORE ACTIVE LIFESTYLE THAN AVERAGE SENIORS AND THE RESULTS SHOULD BE MORE RELEVANT. PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMMES MEANS THEY ARE EAGER TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS. IT WAS FOUND THAT AMONG THE SENIORS, THIRD AGE UNIVERSITY PARTICIPANTS, ONLY ONE THIRD WERE ACTIVE INTERNET USERS. IT WAS LESS THAN EXPECTED, AS SLOVENIA HAS QUITE HIGH INTERNET USAGE AMONG ITS CITIZENS. EDUCATION AND PARTLY AGE WERE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DEFINING INTERNET USE. PUBLIC LIBRARIES CAN PLAY A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OFFERING INFORMATION LITERACY COURSES, OFFERING SPACE AND OTHERS SERVICES TO THEM, BUT THIS WAS NOT CONFIRMED BY THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY. THE PAPER TRIED TO ESTABLISH THE SITUATION WITH A CASE STUDY IN SLOVENIA, A NEW EU MEMBER BUT ALSO ONE OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH THE GREATEST USE OF INTERNET AND WEB. DIGITAL DIVIDE, DIFFERENCES ALONG THE CRITERIA OF AGE, MIGHT BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ELSEWHERE. USE OF INTERNET AND WEB WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE WIDE‐SPREAD AND PROBLEMS WITH SOCIAL GROUPS LEFT OUT WILL BE MORE VISIBLE AND WILL HAVE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON EQUALITY OF ALL CITIZENS. SENIORS AS A SOCIAL GROUP ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE AND NEED HELP. LIBRARIES CAN AND MUST FIND NEW SERVICES WITH INITIATIVES THAT PROMOTE THE REDUCTION OF DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG AGE GROUPS.","UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA;UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA;UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA;UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA, SLOVENIA;NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY OF SLOVENIA, SLOVENIA","UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA,SLOVENIA","BAWDEN D, 2001, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000007083; KLOBAS J, 2001, DOI 10.1108/01435120110358943; LAURICH R, 2002, DOI 10.1108/01604950210447421; WALLIS J, 2005, DOI 10.1108/00242530510593407; SWINDELL R, 1995, DOI 10.1080/0360127950210505; VUORI S, 2005, DOI 10.1108/02634500510577474; WILLIAMS P, 1998, DOI 10.1108/03074809810217965; MEISCHKE H, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.hrtlng.2004.06.006; KARAVIDAS M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.012; HUBREGTSE S, 2005, DOI 10.1108/03074800510587363; MILLWARD P, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066",25,2006,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1003423499,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA;UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA;UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA;UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA;NATIONAL AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY OF SLOVENIA,UNIVERSITY OF LJUBLJANA,NA,"JUZNIC P, 2006, NEW LIBRARY WORLD","JUZNIC P, 2006, NEW LIBRARY WORLD",SLOVENIA; SLOVENIA,10.1108/03074800610677308,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1003423499,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

WHERE ISSUES OF E-DEMOCRACY ARE CONSIDERED, STUDIES GENERALLY HIGHLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES RATHER THAN MEASURING ANY ACTUAL CHANGES IN CITIZEN BEHAVIOUR. THIS STUDY EXAMINES CITIZENS’ PERCEPTIONS, ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOUR, SEEKING SPECIFICALLY TO EXPOSE WHETHER CITIZENS FEEL THAT E-GOVERNMENT ENHANCES DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION AND BRINGS THEM CLOSER TO GOVERNMENT AND THE MACHINERY OF THE STATE. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT STUDY WHICH SUGGEST THAT CITIZENS PERCEIVE SOME MODERATE VALUE IN USING E-GOVERNMENT AS A MEANS OF KEEPING THEMSELVES INFORMED AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE STATE, BUT LITTLE VALUE IN E-GOVERNMENT AS A TOOL OF DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION.","UNIVERSITY OF SURREY, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF SURREY, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY OF SURREY,UNITED KINGDOM","KOLSAKER A, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1470-6431.2004.00373.x; LING T, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1467-9299.00321; CAI S, 2003, DOI 10.1108/09604520310506568; LEE-KELLEY L, 2003, DOI 10.4018/jeco.2003100101; JOINT N, 2005, DOI 10.1108/00242530510583020; DOUGLAS A, 2003, DOI 10.1108/09604520310506540; KUO Y, 2004, DOI 10.1080/14783360410001681854; SZYMANSKI D, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0022-4359(00)00035-x; LINE M, 2003, DOI 10.1108/01435120310501059; HSU M, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2003.08.001; MEUTER M, 2000, DOI 10.1509/jmkg.64.3.50.18024; CAVANAUGH J, 2000, DOI 10.1002/ncr.89305; BARNES M, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1467-9299.00352; PICCOLI G, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.0011-7315.2004.02620.x; MAHRER H, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00184.x; BIASIOTTI M, 2004, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-24683-1_27; CHEN L, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.emj.2003.11.014; COLEMAN S, 2004, DOI 10.1080/1369118042000208870; JENSEN J, 2003, DOI 10.3233/ip-2003-0025; HOFF J, 2003, DOI 10.3233/ip-2003-0026",16,2006,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1043548300,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF SURREY;UNIVERSITY OF SURREY,UNIVERSITY OF SURREY,NA,"KOLSAKER A, 2006, NA","KOLSAKER A, 2006, NA",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1007/11823100_9,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1043548300,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

YET, WE ARGUE THAT BY USING TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS AN INCLUSION/EXCLUSION PROBLEM, IT WILL ALSO RESULT IN MOVING THE PROBLEM FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER. THE ARGUMENTS IN THIS PAPER HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY TWO EMPIRICAL STUDIES AROUND A UBIQUITOUS TECHNOLOGY, THE MOBILE PHONE.

SOCIAL INCLUSION FOR MOBILE ACCESS IS ALSO CLOSELY LINKED TO DEEPLY EMBEDDED STRUCTURES WITHIN SOCIETY, SUCH AS THOSE TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GENDER. TECHNOLOGY MAY BE CHANGING THESE STRUCTURES; INDEED, AGE MAY BE THE NEW GENDER. THE FAMILY OR SOCIAL UNIT MAY ALSO BE A USEFUL ENTITY TO CONSIDER IN THE EXCLUSION DEBATE.

FINDINGS THE DDIX SITUATES FOUR CITIZEN SEGMENTS IN TERMS OF INTERNET ACCESS AND USAGE – GENDER, AGE, EDUCATION AND INCOME. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL DIVIDES EVIDENT WITHIN THE WELSH REGION IN TERMS OF GENDER AND INCOME. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL DIVIDES IN TERMS OF AGE AND EDUCATION.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE DDIX AS FORMULATED CONSIDERS A LIMITED RANGE OF POSSIBLE DIMENSIONS, BOTH IN TERMS OF CITIZEN GROUPS AND INTERNET ACCESS AND USAGE. OTHER POSSIBLE DIMENSIONS FOR CONSIDERATION ARE DISCUSSED IN THE PAPER.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OUR APPLICATION OF A DDIX HAS BEEN USEFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING THE MULTI‐FACETED NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON WITHIN A REGIONAL CONTEXT. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED BOTH TO REFINE SUCH AN IMPORTANT INFORMATION SOCIETY METRIC AND TO APPLY IT IN FURTHER DOMAINS OF ANALYSIS.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER WILL BE OF INTEREST BOTH TO ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND POLICY‐MAKERS INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING AND MEASURING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.","CARDIFF UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","CARDIFF UNIVERSITY,UNITED KINGDOM","KOTTAK C, 1996, DOI 10.1177/089443939601400103; BECK E, 2004, DOI 10.1080/01972240490481009; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; LIFF S, 2004, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1308492; OLPHERT C, 2005, DOI 10.14236/ewic/ad2005.17",11,2007,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1017910211,ISI,CARDIFF UNIVERSITY;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,CARDIFF UNIVERSITY,NA,"BEYNON‐DAVIES P, 2007, JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","BEYNON‐DAVIES P, 2007, JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY",UNITED KINGDOM; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/13287260710817683,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1017910211,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS OF PUBLIC GOVERNANCE INCLUDING ROLES OF CITIZENS, ORGANISATIONS AND GOVERNMENT. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE VIEWS, ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF STAKEHOLDERS IN PROMOTING EGOVERNANCE, WITH A FOCUS ON COUNTRIES THAT ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPING THEIR ICT STRATEGIES.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY APPROACH IS USED BASED ON THE MALAYSIAN EXPERIENCE. A COMBINATION OF INTERVIEWS AND COMMENTS FROM QUESTIONNAIRES ARE USED TO EXAMINE GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS' VIEWPOINTS CONCERNING EGOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT.   FINDINGS WHILE THESE ARE PRELIMINARY, THE QUALITATIVE FINDINGS ARE INTENDED FOR REFLECTION, AS WELL AS, SUGGESTIONS FOR ACTION. THEY INCLUDE: CREATING ECITIZEN PARTNERSHIPS; NARROWING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE; FINDING CONSENSUS ON STRUCTURES AND ROLES IN AN EGOVERNMENT STRATEGY. THE DISCUSSION CALLS FOR COLLECTIVE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS AS PARTNERS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE SOCIAL INCLUSION.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE STUDY IS EXPLORATORY AND THE FINDINGS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS REPRESENTATIVE. HOWEVER, THEY INDICATE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. A SECOND MORE ROBUST EMPIRICAL STUDY IS ENVISAGED WITH MORE EMPHASIS ON APPLICATION OF STAKEHOLDER THEORY AND TECHNIQUES.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE DEBATE IS ABOUT COLLECTIVE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, ARGUING FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF EGOVERNANCE FOR THE NATIONAL GOOD WHICH PROMOTES CONCEPTS SUCH AS EDEMOCRACY AND ECOMMUNITY THROUGH STAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND PARTNERSHIP.","QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST, UNITED KINGDOM;QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST, UNITED KINGDOM;QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST, UNITED KINGDOM","QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST,UNITED KINGDOM","HUSTED B, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00583.x; WALSHAM G, 1995, DOI 10.1057/ejis.1995.9; KÖRNER K, 2005, DOI 10.1108/14720700510604788; GABLE G, 1994, DOI 10.1057/ejis.1994.12; REEKERS N, 1994, DOI 10.1057/ejis.1994.18; BUCHHOLZ R, 2004, DOI 10.1023/b:busi.0000033608.61005.1f; MATTEN D, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8608.2005.00382.x; MOON M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00196; WINDSOR D, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.2006.00584.x; BRYSON J, 2004, DOI 10.1080/14719030410001675722; TAN C, 2005, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2005010102; FREEMAN R, 2004, DOI 10.1287/orsc.1040.0066; LEE A, 1991, DOI 10.1287/orsc.2.4.342; KOLSAKER A, 2006, DOI 10.1504/eg.2006.010798; JONES T, 1995, DOI 10.2307/258852; JONES T, 1999, DOI 10.2307/259075; MYERS M, 1997, DOI 10.2307/249422",21,2007,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1029651035,ISI,QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST;QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST;QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST,QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY BELFAST,NA,"WONG K, 2007, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT","WONG K, 2007, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY & RELIABILITY MANAGEMENT",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/02656710710826199,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1029651035,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE EUROPEAN AND US RESEARCH STUDIES FOCUS ON ISSUES REGARDING THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) SOLUTIONS BY SMES AND DIGITAL DIVIDE PHENOMENA WHICH EXIST BETWEEN SMES AND LARGE CORPORATIONS. THE DATA COLLECTED DURING FACE‐TO‐FACE INTERVIEWS WITH SMES' OWNER–MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES FROM SPAIN, PORTUGAL, POLAND AND THE USA WERE USED FOR MAKING A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BASED ON DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL METHODS. ANALYZING THE BARRIERS THAT DISCOURAGE SMES FROM USING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) AND E‐BUSINESS SOLUTIONS IN THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES MADE IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE REASONS FOR SMES BEING ON THE “WRONG SIDE” OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE MAIN BARRIER TO BETTER UTILIZATION OF ICT AND E‐BUSINESS, AND THUS THE MAIN REASON WHY SMES FACE A DIGITAL DIVIDE, IS NOT SO MUCH THE LACK OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (“MATERIAL ACCESS” BARRIER) AS THE LACK OF PROPER KNOWLEDGE, EDUCATION AND SKILLED OWNER‐MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE (“SKILLS ACCESS” BARRIER). AS LONG AS EUROPEAN SMES DO NOT REALIZE THIS FACT, SO LONG WILL THE SCALE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN EUROPE CONTINUE TO GROW. THE MAIN LIMITATION OF THE APPROACH PRESENTED IN THIS PAPER IS RELATED TO THE SAMPLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SPAIN, PORTUGAL, POLAND AND THE USA. THIS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY OUT PRECISE COMPARATIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS. DESPITE THESE METHODOLOGICAL IMPERFECTIONS, IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PUT FORWARD CERTAIN RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE DIRECTIONS OF ACTIVITIES FOCUSING ON ENHANCING E‐BUSINESS ADOPTION IN SMES. THE MAIN CONCLUSION IS THAT THE ACTIONS AIMED AT BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SMES SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON OVERCOMING THE “SKILLS ACCESS” AND “USAGE ACCESS” BARRIERS WITHIN SMES, NOT THE MATERIAL ONES. THE COMPARISON OF THE WAY THESE PROBLEMS ARE PERCEIVED BY EUROPEAN AND US OWNER‐MANAGERS IS AN ADDED VALUE OF THE PAPER, WHICH BRINGS NEW CONTENT TO THE EXISTING DISCUSSION ON BARRIERS TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ICTS IN SMES. THIS APPROACH IS A STEP FORWARD IN ANALYZING THE DETERMINANTS AND THE MECHANISM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN SMES AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DIMINISH THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM.","UNIVERSITY OF ŁÓDŹ, POLAND","UNIVERSITY OF ŁÓDŹ,POLAND","CHESHER M, 2000, DOI 10.1145/333334.333338; FERLANDER S, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600630732; GRAHAM S, 2002, DOI 10.1080/00420980220099050; GÓMEZ BARROSO J, 2004, DOI 10.1007/s10209-004-0103-0; HOLLOWAY D, 2005, DOI 10.1080/13691180500146276; BEYNON‐DAVIES P, 2007, DOI 10.1108/13287260710817683; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; LUCCHETTI R, 2004, DOI 10.1023/b:sbej.0000027667.55821.53; CHINN M, 2006, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; STANDING C, 2004, DOI 10.1002/j.1681-4835.2004.tb00130.x; SCHLEIFE K, 2006, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.955759",85,2008,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS",PUB.1041044173,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF ŁÓDŹ,UNIVERSITY OF ŁÓDŹ,NA,"ARENDT L, 2008, JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","ARENDT L, 2008, JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY",POLAND,10.1108/13287260810897738,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1041044173,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ILLUSTRATIONS OF ARGUMENTS ARE BASED ON REVIEWS OF ACADEMIC LITERATURE, PROJECTS REPORTS, POLICY DOCUMENTS AND RESEARCH FINDINGS FROM THE PENCEIL PROJECT, AND ARE INFORMED BY CRITICAL THEORY. THE RESEARCH CONSISTED OF 47 SEMI‐STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND ACTION RESEARCH INVOLVING DESIGNING AN E‐LITERACY CURRICULUM AND RUNNING A COURSE BASED ON IT.   FINDINGS  A DISCOURSE OF MISSED OPPORTUNITIES AND “BEING LEFT BEHIND”, PRESENT IN POLICY STATEMENTS AND POPULAR MEDIA, LEADS TO OBJECTIFYING NON‐USERS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICT) AS “OTHERS”. THIS DISCOURSE IS OFTEN INTERNALISED BY NON‐USERS, BUT IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO POSITIVE ACTIONS, LEAVING SOME FEELING INADEQUATE. SO FAR INITIATIVES SEEKING TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAVE HAD MODERATE SUCCESS. TO RESPOND TO DIGITAL EXCLUSION WE NEED TO OPPOSE THE UNCHECKED SPREAD OF E‐SERVICES, AND HELP NON‐USERS OF ICT TO BECOME USERS OR (IF THEY CHOOSE TO) INFORMED “ REFUSNIKS ”. INITIATIVES AIMING TO FACILITATE PEOPLE'S SUSTAINABLE AND MEANINGFUL USE OF ICT OUGHT TO DRAW ON INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES. A CURRICULUM SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY LEARNERS' EXPERIENCES AND THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF NEEDS, AND GO BEYOND IT SKILLS.    RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER DOES NOT OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION, CONCENTRATING INSTEAD ON CHOSEN PROBLEMS AND ARGUMENTS. IT IS BASED ON THE UK EXPERIENCE, AND THUS MORE RELEVANT TO DEVELOPED RATHER THAN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER RAISES AWARENESS OF DIFFERENT ISSUES RELATED TO DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND WAYS OF ADDRESSING THEM.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER CALLS TO QUESTION CURRENT DISCOURSE AND INITIATIVES ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR LIMITATIONS. IT PRESENTS ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF RESPONDING TO DIGITAL EXCLUSION.","LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE, UNITED KINGDOM","LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE,UNITED KINGDOM","STROVER S, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309481; DEVINS D, 2002, DOI 10.1080/0034340022000012360; HOPKINS L, 2005, DOI 10.1080/01972240500253590; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0160-791x(02)00062-3; HADDON L, 2000, DOI 10.1177/1461444800002004001; CUSHMAN M, 2006, DOI 10.1007/0-387-34588-4_23; YU L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0961000606070600; KVASNY L, 2001, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_27; GORARD S, 2000, DOI 10.1080/713651571; KVASNY L, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600630740; LIVINGSTONE S, 2004, DOI 10.1080/10714420490280152; WARSCHAUER M, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0895904804266469; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; ADAM A, 2006, DOI 10.1108/09593840610689822; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309490; GOLDING P, 2001, DOI 10.1111/1468-0041.00196; KVASNY L, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00242.x; FEENBERG A, 1988, DOI 10.1007/978-1-349-19275-5_12; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; DUTTON W, 2005, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1327035; COMPAINE B, 2001, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001",26,2008,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1041681461,ISI,LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE,LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE,NA,"KLECUN E, 2008, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE","KLECUN E, 2008, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/09593840810896028,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1041681461,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

HOWEVER, VERY FEW EMPIRICAL STUDIES EXIST THAT EXPLORE HOW THESE MULTI-CHANNEL STRATEGIES SHOULD BE SHAPED. IN THIS ARTICLE WE TEST A NUMBER OF HYPOTHESES ON CITIZENS' CHANNEL USE BEHAVIOUR AND THE DETERMINANTS OF THIS BEHAVIOUR. FURTHER, WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CITIZENS WITH AND WITHOUT A PERSONAL COMPUTER. IN OUR CONCLUSIONS WE CALL FOR MULTI-CHANNEL STRATEGIES THAT DO NOT ONLY INCORPORATE THE FEATURES OF SERVICE CHANNELS AND THE FRONT—BACK OFFICE INTEGRATION, BUT ALSO DEAL WITH PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND TASK CHARACTERISTICS. FURTHER, DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES STILL INFLUENCE CHANNEL USAGE BY CITIZENS, SO IT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP ALL CHANNELS OPEN FOR CITIZENS. FINALLY, OUR STUDY REVEALS THAT MULTI-CHANNELLING IS A VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT ON WHICH RESEARCH IS STILL IN ITS INFANCY. POINTS FOR PRACTITIONERS • MULTI-CHANNEL MANAGEMENT MAY BENEFIT MOST FROM CHANNEL INTEGRATION. • CHANNELS HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT RENDER THEM SUITABLE FOR DIFFERENT (PARTS OF) SERVICES. • COMPUTER `HAVE-NOTS' STILL RELY ON TRADITIONAL SERVICE CHANNELS, SO THESE SHOULD REMAIN ACCESSIBLE.","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NETHERLANDS","BLACK N, 2002, DOI 10.1108/02652320210432945; LEE J, 2002, DOI 10.1108/08876040210427227; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; BALASUBRAMANIAN S, 2005, DOI 10.1002/dir.20032; REDDICK C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.003; CHEN Y, 2006, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2006010104; NOBLE S, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2004.10.005; KWAST M, 1997, DOI 10.1177/0003603x9704200405; DUGDALE A, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0020852305051687; THOMAS J, 2003, DOI 10.1093/jpart/mug010; DAFT R, 1986, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.32.5.554; REDDICK C, 2005, DOI 10.1300/j399v02n01_03; ALBA J, 1997, DOI 10.2307/1251788; CARLSON J, 1999, DOI 10.2307/257090; CARLSON J, 1994, DOI 10.5465/ambpp.1994.10344817; FULK J, 1990, DOI 10.4135/9781483325385.n6; DAFT R, 1983, DOI 10.21236/ada128980; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; ALBA J, 1997, DOI 10.1177/002224299706100303; AVERY R, 1997, DOI 10.17016/bulletin.1997.83-9",69,2008,"BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1042945103,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NA,"PIETERSON W, 2008, INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES","PIETERSON W, 2008, INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES",NETHERLANDS,10.1177/0020852307085736,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1042945103,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

AS DATA AND COMPUTING RESOURCES IN A VIRTUAL HOSPITAL ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER MANY SITES THE CONCEPT OF THE GRID SHOULD BE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER COMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND PLATFORMS. A PROMISING APPROACH IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURES FOR AN INVISIBLE GRID, HIDING COMPLEXITY FOR BOTH APPLICATION DEVELOPERS AND END-USERS. AN EXAMPLE OF A PROMISING MEDICAL APPLICATION OF GRID TECHNOLOGY IS THE REAL-TIME 3D-VISUALIZATION AND MANIPULATION OF PATIENT DATA FOR INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT PLANNING. GLOBAL NETWORKS AND THE USE OF COMPUTERS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES STIMULATE AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIRTUAL UNIVERSITIES FOR ELEARNING. ESPECIALLY REAL-TIME INTERACTIVE APPLICATIONS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN TAILORED AND PERSONALISED SERVICES. HOWEVER, IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST TECHNOLOGY TO MOVE FROM PURE E-LEARNING TOWARDS THE FULL EXPANSION OF UBIQUITOUS ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE (U-LEARNING).","CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN, GERMANY;CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN, GERMANY;CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN, GERMANY;CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN, GERMANY","CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN,GERMANY","GRASCHEW G, 2005, DOI 10.1007/11508380_1; PANDE R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.cursur.2003.07.009; HEINZLREITER P, 2003, DOI 10.1142/s0129626403001203",0,2008,CREATIVE ARTS AND WRITING; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; SCREEN AND DIGITAL MEDIA,PUB.1010161998,ISI,CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN;CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN;CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN;CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN,CHARITÉ - UNIVERSITY MEDICINE BERLIN,NA,"GRASCHEW G, 2008, NA","GRASCHEW G, 2008, NA",GERMANY,10.1007/978-3-540-69367-3_111,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1010161998,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE WHERE FLICKR'S REAL NOVELTY LIES, EXAMINING ITS FUNCTIONALITY AND ITS PLACE IN THE WORLD OF AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHY. SEVERAL OPTIMISTIC VIEWS OF THE IMPACT OF FLICKR SUCH AS ITS FACILITATION OF CITIZEN JOURNALISM, “VERNACULAR CREATIVITY” AND IN LEARNING AS AN “AFFINITY SPACE” ARE EVALUATED.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER DRAWS ON A WIDE RANGE OF SOURCES INCLUDING PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS WITH ITS DEVELOPERS, USER OPINIONS EXPRESSED IN FORUMS, TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS AND CONTENT ANALYSIS OF USER PROFILES AND ACTIVITY.   FINDINGS FLICKR'S DEVELOPMENT PATH PASSES FROM AN INNOVATIVE SOCIAL GAME TO A RELATIVELY FAMILIAR MODEL OF A WEB SITE, ITSELF DEVELOPED THROUGH INTENSE USER PARTICIPATION BUT LATER STABILISING WITH THE REASSERTION OF A COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE MEMBERSHIP. THE BROADER CONTEXT OF THE IMPACT OF FLICKR IS EXAMINED BY LOOKING AT THE INSTITUTIONS OF AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHY AND PARTICULARLY THE CODE OF PICTORIALISM PROMOTED BY THE CLUBS AND INDUSTRY DURING THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE NATURE OF FLICKR AS A BENIGN SPACE IS PREMISED ON THE WAY THE DEMOCRATIC POTENTIAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY IS CONTROLLED BY SUCH INSTITUTIONS. THE LIMITS OF OPTIMISTIC CLAIMS ABOUT FLICKR ARE IDENTIFIED IN THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SATISFY COMMERCIAL PURPOSES, CONTINUING DIGITAL DIVIDES IN ACCESS AND THE LOW INTERACTIVITY AND CRITICALITY ON FLICKR.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE FLICKR IS AN INTERESTING SOURCE OF CHANGE, BUT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF LONG‐TERM DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOBBY AND WIDER SOCIAL PROCESSES. BY SETTING FLICKR IN SUCH A BROAD CONTEXT, ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND THAT OF WEB2.0 MORE GENERALLY CAN BE FULLY ASSESSED.","UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD,UNITED KINGDOM","WHITEMAN J, 1990, DOI 10.1080/08109029008631872; MACHIN D, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1470357204045785; MARLOW C, 2006, DOI 10.1145/1149941.1149949; SCHWARTZ D, 1987, DOI 10.1080/08351818709389292; DAVIES J, 2006, DOI 10.2304/elea.2006.3.2.217; WATNEY S, 1984, DOI 10.1093/screen/25.1.67; COHEN K, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0163443705057675; KILBORN R, 1994, DOI 10.1177/0267323194009004003; SCHWARTZ D, 1986, DOI 10.1177/089124168601500202; WERRY C, 1999, DOI 10.5210/fm.v4i9.690; MEYER E, 2005, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1353879",32,2008,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1018302776,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD,UNIVERSITY OF SHEFFIELD,NA,"COX AM, 2008, ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT","COX AM, 2008, ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/00012530810908210,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1018302776,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER REPORTS ON AN EXTENDED MULTI‐METHOD CASE STUDY OF E‐PROCUREMENT IN THE UN. A THREE STAGE METHODOLOGY IS ADOPTED – A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY OF UN ORGANIZATIONS, CASE STUDIES OF E‐PROCUREMENT ISSUES IN THREE UN ORGANIZATIONS, AND AN INTERACTIVE WORKSHOP WITH THE HEADS OF PURCHASING OF UN ORGANIZATIONS.   FINDINGS THE PAPER FINDS THAT E‐PROCUREMENT IS BEING USED IN THE UN FOR TRANSACTIONS OF ROUTINE, NON‐STRATEGIC PURCHASES. UN DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO ADOPT E‐PROCUREMENT THAN HUMANITARIAN AID AGENCIES AS THEIR OPERATIONS ARE MORE PREDICTABLE. THE INTENTION OF THE MAJORITY OF UN ORGANIZATIONS TO ADOPT E‐PROCUREMENT WITHIN THREE YEARS HAS BEEN REVERSED FOLLOWING THE WORKSHOP, WHICH REVEALED THAT ADOPTION OF E‐PROCUREMENT WOULD RUN COUNTER TO UN POLICIES OF SUPPORTING LESS DEVELOPED NATIONS, REGIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS. A MORE CAUTIOUS, “WAIT AND SEE” APPROACH HAS BEEN TAKEN RATHER THAN TO UNILATERALLY PROMOTE E‐PROCUREMENT ACROSS THE UN SYSTEM.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE UN, YET COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR, OR MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES CONSIDERING IMPLEMENTING E‐PROCUREMENT WITH SUPPLIERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS E‐PROCUREMENT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF OTHER PROCUREMENT POLICY OBJECTIVES.

THE FAST AND ECONOMICAL PROVISION OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF EQUIPMENT IS ONE OF THE MANY CHALLENGES FACED BY SUCH PROGRAMMES. IF AN INCREASE IS TO BE ACHIEVED IN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF COMPUTER SUPPLIES FOR SCHOOLS, NOT ONLY MUST EQUIPMENT BE PROVIDED, BUT ALSO SUITABLE TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE DELIVERED. FURTHERMORE, APPROPRIATE RECYCLING HAS TO BE ENSURED, SO THAT END-OF-LIFE EQUIPMENT CAN BE DEALT WITH PROPERLY. THIS STUDY HAS EVALUATED THE SUITABILITY OF THREE COMPUTER SUPPLY SCENARIOS TO SCHOOLS IN COLOMBIA: (I) 'COLOMBIAN REFURBISHMENT', -REFURBISHMENT OF COMPUTERS DONATED IN COLOMBIA, (II) 'OVERSEAS REFURBISHMENT', -IMPORT OF COMPUTERS WHICH WERE DONATED AND REFURBISHED ABROAD, AND (III) 'XO LAPTOP', -PURCHASE OF LOW COST COMPUTERS MANUFACTURED IN KOREA. THE METHODS APPLIED WERE: MATERIAL FLOW ASSESSMENT, -TO ASSESS THE QUANTITIES-, LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT, -TO ASSESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, AND THE APPLICATION OF THE MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE UTILITY THEORY, -TO ANALYSE, EVALUATE AND COMPARE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE MOST SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION PROVED TO BE THE LOCAL REFURBISHMENT OF SECOND HAND COMPUTERS OF COLOMBIAN ORIGIN TO AN APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL STANDARD. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF SUCH PRACTICES NEED TO BE EVALUATED CAREFULLY, AS SECOND HAND APPLIANCES HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED, REQUIRE SPARE PARTS AND SOMETIMES USE MORE ENERGY THAN NEWER EQUIPMENT. PROVIDING SCHOOLS WITH SECOND HAND COMPUTERS FROM OVERSEAS AND THROUGH PROGRAMMES SUCH AS 'ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD' HAS THE DISADVANTAGE THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR SOCIAL IMPROVEMENTS - SUCH AS CREATION OF JOBS AND LOCAL INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT - IS VERY LOW.","SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SWITZERLAND;ETH ZURICH, SWITZERLAND;SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SWITZERLAND;SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SWITZERLAND;COMPUTADORES PARA EDUCAR, CARRERA 8 ENTRE CALLE 12 Y 13 PISO 5 EDIFICIO MURILLO TORO, BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, COLOMBIA;SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SWITZERLAND","SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,SWITZERLAND","HAJKOWICZ S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.03.023; HILTY L, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.05.007; KAWAMOTO K, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.02.004; HISCHIER R, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.eiar.2005.04.003; DUAN H, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.10.063; SCHARNHORST W, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.envint.2006.03.001; PARK P, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.01.001; MANSELL R, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00074-3; SEPÚLVEDA A, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.eiar.2009.04.001; KAWAMOTO K, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0360-5442(01)00084-6; PELGRUM W, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0360-1315(01)00045-8; KEENEY R, 1979, DOI 10.1109/tsmc.1979.4310245; JAMES J, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0197-3975(01)00030-3; NAKAMURA S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.05.002; BRUNNER P, 2004, DOI 10.1007/bf02979426; STREICHER-PORTE M, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10098-007-0114-7; HAYES J, 1998, DOI 10.1177/001872679805100701; WILLIAMS E, 2004, DOI 10.1021/es035152j; KANG H, 2006, DOI 10.1021/es0503783; ATLEE J, 2006, DOI 10.1021/es050935l; JAMES J, 2001, DOI 10.1177/016555150102700403; MITRA S, 2005, DOI 10.14742/ajet.1328; SCHOLZ R, 2002, DOI 10.4135/9781412984027",38,2009,ECONOMICS; ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,PUB.1023157574,ISI,SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;COMPUTADORES PARA EDUCAR;SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,SWISS FEDERAL LABORATORIES FOR MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,NA,"STREICHER-PORTE M, 2009, JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","STREICHER-PORTE M, 2009, JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT",SWITZERLAND; SWITZERLAND,10.1016/j.jenvman.2009.06.002,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1023157574,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

INTEREST IN DIGITAL DIVIDE IS ALSO WIDELY PRESENT IN LITERATURE. IN THESE LAST FIVE YEARS, RESEARCH AND EMPIRICAL SURVEYS ON THIS SUBJECT HAVE NOTABLY INCREASED (BAKER, 2001; HARGITTAI, DI MAGGIO, NEUMAN, & ROBINSON, 2001; RANIERI, 2006; RALLET, 2004; SARTORI, 2006; VAN DIJK, 2005).

SIMILARLY, UNDERSTANDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF IT IN GOVERNMENT WITHOUT INCORPORATING A DEMAND PERSPECTIVE WOULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO PARTIAL EXPLANATIONS OF A COMPLEX SOCIAL REALITY. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT STUDIES ABOUT E-GOVERNMENT AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, WHICH HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY DISCONNECTED RESEARCH AREAS, HAVE IMPORTANT PARALLELS AND POTENTIAL INTERSECTIONS. THESE PARALLELS MAY BE USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING E-GOVERNMENT PROJECTS AND POLICIES IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND, CONSEQUENTLY, FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE DIGITAL STRATEGIES. THE PAPER REVIEWS TRAJECTORIES IN E-GOVERNMENT AND DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH AND SUGGESTS POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS DRAWN FROM THE DIGITAL DIVIDE LITERATURE FOR E-GOVERNMENT RESEARCH AND PRACTICE, INCLUDING MODEL AND THEORY DEVELOPMENT, UNDERSTANDING USERS, AND SOME DETERMINANTS OF DEMAND.","UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY, STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES;CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN Y DOCENCIA ECONÓMICAS, MEXICO;ISTITUTO SUPERIORE MARIO BOELLA, ITALY","UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY, STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK,UNITED STATES","ANDERSEN K, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2005.11.008; MUHLBERGER P, 2006, DOI 10.1145/1146598.1146620; LANDSBERGEN D, 2001, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00023; DAWES S, 1996, DOI 10.1002/(sici)1520-6688(199622)15:3<377::aid-pam3>3.0.co; BERTOT J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.02.001; BROWN D, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0020852305053883; FERRO E, 2005, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-32257-3_8; KUK G, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.004; JAEGER P, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.01.012; HUNG S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2005.11.005; KRAEMER K, 2006, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2006010101; SAHRAOUI S, 2007, DOI 10.1108/17506160710733698; KHOSROW-POUR M, 2006, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-799-7.ch102; KLING R, 1999, DOI 10.1145/572183.572189; RABER D, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0740-8188(02)00114-7; NELSON L, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1540-6210.62.s1.12; YILDIZ M, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.01.002; REDDICK C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.003; ANDERSON K, 2005, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2005100102; MOON M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00196; ANTTIROIKO A, 2007, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch122; LUNA-REYES L, 2007, DOI 10.4018/jcec.2007040104; JAEGER P, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2005.10.002; CANO J, 2003, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-040-0.ch004; REDDICK C, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.11.004; EDMISTON K, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0275074002250255; LAYNE K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00066-1; GIL-GARCIA J, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.04.005; HEEKS R, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.06.005; PAVLICHEV A, 2004, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-122-3.ch001; ANTTIROIKO A, 2003, DOI 10.1145/903893.903926; DHOLAKIA R, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600791374; MOON M, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0734371x05275508; GIL-GARCÍA J, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2005.02.001; DANZIGER J, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0894439303259892; DIMITROVA D, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0894439305281517; MOSSBERGER K, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1078087405283511; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2001, DOI 10.1287/isre.12.2.121.9700; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2000, DOI 10.1287/orsc.11.4.404.14600; ORLIKOWSKI W, 1992, DOI 10.1287/orsc.3.3.398; DESANCTIS G, 1994, DOI 10.1287/orsc.5.2.121; II M, 2006, DOI 10.1504/ijiem.2006.010916; SEN A, 1993, DOI 10.1093/0198287976.003.0003; BÉLANGER F, 2006, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2006.464; PARDO T, 2002, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2002.994076; RIGGINS F, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00074; LAMB L, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036529; GRÖNLUND Å, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1cais.01539",268,2009,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; HUMAN SOCIETY,PUB.1012858785,ISI,UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY;CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN Y DOCENCIA ECONÓMICAS;ISTITUTO SUPERIORE MARIO BOELLA,UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY,NA,"HELBIG N, 2009, GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY","HELBIG N, 2009, GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY",USA; MEXICO; ITALY,10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1012858785,NA,NA,NA,"DIRECTORATE FOR COMPUTER & INFORMATION SCIENCE & ENGINEERING,NSF CISE,ALEXANDRIA,UNITED STATES",DIM

BUT WHAT IS DIGITAL OR SOCIAL INCLUSION? THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE THE NOTION OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION AS A VARIETY OF, SOMETIMES CONFLICTING, SOCIAL PROGRAMMES WHICH EMBODY IDEAS OF WHAT SOCIETY SHOULD BE. BECOMING MORE AWARE OF THIS VARIETY OF APPROACH CAN GIVE INSIGHTS INTO PROGRAMMES ADDRESSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THE POLITICAL, CULTURAL AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF POLICIES OF SOCIAL INCLUSION.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER ANALYSES THE NOTION OF SOCIAL INCLUSION AS A VARIETY OF SOCIAL POLICIES TO ADDRESS SOCIAL EXCLUSION AND DEVELOP THE NATION STATE. IT USES AN EXAMPLE OF A TELECENTRE IN JORDAN'S KNOWLEDGE STATION (KS) PROGRAMME TO ILLUSTRATE AND EXTEND THIS ANALYSIS.

ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER ARGUES THAT ANALYSES OF DIGITAL DIVIDES AND DIGITAL EXCLUSION COULD BE STRENGTHENED BY A CLOSER UNDERSTANDING OF POLICIES OF SOCIAL INCLUSION. IN THIS WAY IT IS POSSIBLE TO MOVE FROM TECHNOLOGICAL CONNECTION AS A MEASURE OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE TO A MORE THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING USING SOCIAL INCLUSION POLICY WHICH ILLUMINATES SOCIAL, POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.","AL-AHLIYYA AMMAN UNIVERSITY, JORDAN;UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM","AL-AHLIYYA AMMAN UNIVERSITY,JORDAN","STROVER S, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309481; BELL D, 1976, DOI 10.1080/00131727609336501; AMAWI A, 1996, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-4967.1996.tb00238.x; WIKTOROWICZ Q, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0305-750x(01)00092-4; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; WHEELER D, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s10676-006-9122-2; WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309490; MOLLA A, 2007, DOI 10.1504/ijkl.2007.016835; MOFLEH S, 2008, DOI 10.1002/j.1681-4835.2008.tb00236.x; WADE R, 2002, DOI 10.1163/19426720-00804005",12,2009,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1033290534,ISI,AL-AHLIYYA AMMAN UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER,AL-AHLIYYA AMMAN UNIVERSITY,NA,"AL‐JAGHOUB S, 2009, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS IN SOCIETY","AL‐JAGHOUB S, 2009, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS IN SOCIETY",JORDAN; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/14779960910955864,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1033290534,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IN 1998, THE UNITED NATIONS LABELLED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AS A NEW TYPE OF POVERTY THAT WAS DIVIDING THE WORLD (CF. HUBREGTSE, 2005). A UNDP (UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME) REPORT IN 1999 (CF. NORRIS, 2000) STATED THAT “THE NETWORK SOCIETY IS CREATING PARALLEL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS” THAT INCREASE THE DIVISIONS BETWEEN RICH AND POOR NATIONS (P.3). THE TERM, IN EFFECT, CAPTURES THE SOCIAL INEQUALITY OF ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY THE INTERNET, AS WELL AS THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THIS INEQUALITY FOR NATIONS AND SOCIETIES. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TERM IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE NOTION OF AN INFORMATION SOCIETY, WHERE INFORMATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOCIAL ENRICHMENT OF SOCIETIES AND NATIONS. THE DIFFUSION OF TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE INTERNET, HAS MEANT THE SURFACING OF VARIOUS SOCIAL ISSUES INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY’S IMPACT ON SOCIETY, ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OLDER MEDIA FORMS, AND ITS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON PEOPLE’S SOCIAL AND POLITICAL LIVES (ROBINSON, 2003, P. I). NEW TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE INTERNET, ARE SEEN AS TRANSFORMING THE GLOBE INTO AN INFORMATION SOCIETY WITH THE ABILITY TO PROMOTE NEW FORMS OF SOCIAL IDENTITY AND SOCIAL NETWORKS WHILE DECENTRALIZING POWER (CASTELLS, 1996, P. 2001). ROBIN AND WEBSTER (1999, P. 91), NEVERTHELESS, ARE OF THE VIEW THAT THE CONTEXTUALIZATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE DEBATES WITHIN THE ISSUE OF INFORMATION REVOLUTION IS MISLEADING, FOR IT “POLITICISES THE PROCESS OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT BY FRAMING IT AS A MATTER OF SHIFT IN THE AVAILABILITY OF AND ACCESS OF INFORMATION.” THE TERM DIGITAL DIVIDE CONVEYS THE BROADER CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS AND IN PARTICULAR, THE CENTRE-PERIPHERY POWER CONFIGURATION MARKED BY AMERICAN DOMINANCE OVER THE REST OF THE WORLD (CHEN & WELLMAN, 2004, P. 41). IN FACT, RHETORIC AND LITERATURE ON TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION HAVE ALWAYS EMPHASIZED THIS DIVIDE (SEE GALTUNG & RUGE, 1965), NOT TO MENTION THE DEBATES THAT WERE SPARKED IN THE 1980S BY UNESCO’S PROCLAMATION OF THE NEW WORLD INFORMATION ORDER (CF. NORRIS, 2000). THE TERM HAS BEEN ANALYSED BOTH AT GLOBAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS, AND HAS INVOLVED THE INVESTIGATION OF SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXTS, GLOBAL GOVERNANCE, POLICY ISSUES, AS WELL AS CULTURAL ELEMENTS. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ON A GLOBAL LEVEL MAY ENTAIL COMPARISONS OF LARGE REGIONS, BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, AND BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. IN MODERN CONSCIOUSNESS, THE PHRASE CAPTURES THE DISADVANTAGES AND INEQUALITIES OF THOSE WHO LACK ACCESS OR REFRAIN FROM USING ICTS IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES (CULLEN, 2003).","UNIVERSITY OF BRIGHTON, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY OF BRIGHTON,UNITED KINGDOM","LUYT B, 2006, DOI 10.1108/00012530610687669; CULLEN R, 2003, DOI 10.1108/02640470310480506; GALTUNG J, 1965, DOI 10.1177/002234336500200104; CULLEN R, 2001, DOI 10.1108/14684520110410517; MENOU M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000007045; FINK C, 2003, DOI 10.1108/14636690310507180; HUBREGTSE S, 2005, DOI 10.1108/03074800510587363; MARTIN S, 2007, DOI 10.1525/sp.2007.54.1.1; XIAOMING H, 2004, DOI 10.5210/fm.v9i2.1118; LUYT B, 2004, DOI 10.5210/fm.v9i8.1166; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; CASTELLS M, 2001, DOI 10.1007/978-3-322-89613-1",3,2009,"COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA STUDIES; CREATIVE ARTS AND WRITING; HUMAN SOCIETY; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE; SCREEN AND DIGITAL MEDIA; DEVELOPMENT STUDIES",PUB.1034485578,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF BRIGHTON,UNIVERSITY OF BRIGHTON,NA,"KHOSROW-POUR M, 2009, NA","KHOSROW-POUR M, 2009, NA",UNITED KINGDOM,10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch117,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1034485578,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS PAPER ADDRESSES ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT APPEARS TO BE IMPORTANT IN SEVERAL CONCEPTUALIZATIONS OF HOW TO APPROACH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE; THE DIFFERENTIAL POSSESSION OF SO-CALLED DIGITAL SKILLS. THE PROBLEM OF BEING SHORT OF SKILLS BECOMES URGENT WHEN GOVERNMENTS SUPPOSE THAT CITIZENS ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE ABOUT EVERY TASK ON THE INTERNET. OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS FOR OPERATIONAL, FORMAL, INFORMATION AND STRATEGIC SKILLS ARE USED TO MEASURE THE INTERNET SKILLS OF THE DUTCH POPULATION AT LARGE, BY GIVING 109 SUBJECTS NINE GOVERNMENT RELATED ASSIGNMENTS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED ON THE INTERNET. SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FOLLOWING A TWO STEP APPROACH; RANDOMLY SELECT A SAMPLE FROM THE BOOK/LIST OF FIXED TELEPHONY SUBSCRIBERS, FOLLOWED BY DRAWING A SELECTIVE QUOTA SAMPLE FOR THE STRATA OF GENDER, AGE AND EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ON AVERAGE 80% OF THE OPERATIONAL SKILL INTERNET TASKS, 72% OF FORMAL INTERNET SKILLS TASKS, 62% OF THE INFORMATION INTERNET SKILLS TASKS AND 22% OF STRATEGIC INTERNET SKILLS TASKS ASSIGNED HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED. THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT'S EXPECTATION THAT EVERY CITIZEN WITH AN INTERNET CONNECTION IS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENTS FOLLOWING TASKS THE GOVERNMENT THINKS EVERY INTERNET USER CAN PERFORM, CLEARLY IS NOT JUSTIFIED. THE ARTICLE PROVIDES TWO TYPES OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO CHANGE THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING GOVERNMENT WEBSITES AND FOR IMPROVING THE SKILL LEVELS OF DUTCH CITIZENS ARE SUGGESTED.","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NETHERLANDS","BAWDEN D, 2001, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000007083; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.1002/asi.10166; TALJA S, 2004, DOI 10.1002/asi.20091; VAN DEURSEN A, 2006, DOI 10.1007/11823100_24; EBBERS W, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.11.003; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001; VAN DIJK J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-74444-3_14; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; BERTOT J, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4; JAEGER P, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.03.002; FREESE J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.008; VAN DEURSEN A, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-74444-3_13; PIETERSON W, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0020852307085736; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; GOULDING A, 2001, DOI 10.1177/096100060103300301; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812",162,2009,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1033460986,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NA,"VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY","VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY",NETHERLANDS,10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1033460986,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

SEARCH ENGINES CAN EFFICIENTLY SERVE DAILY INFORMATION NEEDS DUE TO THE ENORMOUS REDUNDANCY OF RELEVANT RESOURCES ON THE WEB. FOR EDUCATIONAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION NEEDS, THE WEB FUNCTIONS MUCH LESS EFFICIENTLY: SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING IS BUILT ON A CULTURE OF UNIQUE REFERENCE PUBLICATIONS, AND MOREOVER, DOCUMENTS ABOUND WITH SPECIALIZED STRUCTURES SUCH AS TECHNICAL NOMENCLATURE, NOTATIONAL CONVENTIONS, REFERENCES, TABLES, OR GRAPHS. MANY OF THESE STRUCTURES ARE PECULIAR TO SPECIALIZED COMMUNITIES DETERMINED BY NATIONALITY, RESEARCH GROUP MEMBERSHIP, OR ADHERENCE TO A SPECIAL SCHOOL OF THOUGHT. TO KEEP THE MUCH-LAMENTED “DIGITAL DIVIDE” FROM BECOMING A “CULTURAL DIVIDE,” WE HAVE TO MAKE ONLINE MATERIAL MORE ACCESSIBLE AND ADAPTABLE TO INDIVIDUAL USERS. IN THIS PAPER, WE ATTACK THIS GOAL FOR THE FIELD OF MATHEMATICS WHERE KNOWLEDGE IS ABSTRACT, HIGHLY STRUCTURED, AND EXTRAORDINARILY INTERLINKED. MODERN, CONTENT-BASED REPRESENTATION FORMATS LIKE OPENMATH OR CONTENT MATHML ALLOW US TO CAPTURE, MODEL, RELATE, AND REPRESENT MATHEMATICAL KNOWLEDGE OBJECT, AND THUS, MAKE THEM CONTEXT-AWARE AND MACHINE-ADAPTABLE TO THE RESPECTIVE USER CONTEXTS. BUILDING ON PREVIOUS WORK, WHICH CAN MAKE MATHEMATICAL NOTATIONS ADAPTABLE, WE EMPLOY USER MODELING TECHNIQUES TO MAKE THEM ADAPTIVE TO RELIEVE THE READER OF CONFIGURATION TASKS. WE PRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ADAPTIVE NOTATION MANAGEMENT AND EVALUATE IT ON THE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROTOTYPE PANTA RHEI.","UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND;JACOBS UNIVERSITY, GERMANY;JACOBS UNIVERSITY, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND,NEW ZEALAND","KOHLHASE M, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-85110-3_41; HECKMANN D, 2003, DOI 10.1007/3-540-44963-9_55; MÜLLER C, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-87781-3_5; RIVEST R, 1978, DOI 10.1145/359340.359342; DE BRA P, 2003, DOI 10.1145/900051.900068; HECKMANN D, 2005, DOI 10.1007/11527886_58; MELIS E, 2004, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-24844-6_12; BRUSILOVSKY P, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-72079-9; LI M, 1997, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4757-2606-0; ANDREJKO A, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-70802-7_38; LANGE C, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-68234-9_68; KOBSA A, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-72079-9_4; ODLYZKO A, 1995, DOI 10.1006/ijhc.1995.1004; NAYLOR B, 2003, DOI 10.1023/a:1022955412266; KOHLHASE M, 2006, DOI 10.1007/11826095; MELIS E, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-69132-7_45; CHAITIN G, 1987, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511608858",1,2009,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1051515811,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;JACOBS UNIVERSITY;JACOBS UNIVERSITY,UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND,NA,"MÜLLER C, 2009, INFORMATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT","MÜLLER C, 2009, INFORMATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT",NEW ZEALAND; GERMANY,10.1080/10580530903017583,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1051515811,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IN CREATING THEIR SITES, SMOS OFTEN UNDERLINE THE CAPACITY OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO INVOLVE MEMBERS AND SYMPATHIZERS IN ORGANIZATIONAL PROCESSES AND INTERNAL DECISION-MAKING. HOWEVER, WEB SITE DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT IMPLIES MANY CHOICES AMONG VARIOUS GOALS, OFTEN IN RECIPROCAL TENSION: STRESSING ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY VERSUS OPENING TO THE OUTSIDE; INCREASING TRANSPARENCY VERSUS RESERVING SOME SECTIONS TO MEMBERS; INFORMING USERS VERSUS MOBILIZING THEM; WIDENING THE DEBATE TO PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT OPINIONS VERSUS DEEPENING THE DISCUSSION IN HOMOGENEOUS GROUPS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE FOCUS ON HOW THE WEB SITES OF SMOS ARE FULFILLING INTERNET POTENTIALITIES, CONSIDERING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THEIR ONLINE PRESENCE. THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WAS BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF 261 WEB SITES OF GLOBAL JUSTICE MOVEMENT (GJM) ORGANIZATIONS IN SIX DIFFERENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND AT THE TRANSNATIONAL LEVEL. DIVERSE QUALITIES OF SMOS’ WEB SITES CAN BE EXPLORED EMPIRICALLY, FOCUSING ON A SERIES OF DIMENSIONS SUCH AS: INFORMATION PROVISION, IDENTITY BUILDING, TRANSPARENCY/ACCOUNTABILITY, MOBILIZATION, AND INTERVENTION ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN OUR ANALYSIS, WE WILL USE CONTEXTUAL CHARACTERISTICS (LEVEL OF INTERNET ACCESS, GJM FEATURES) AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS (STRUCTURAL FEATURES, TERRITORIAL LEVEL OF ACTION, YEAR OF FOUNDATION) TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF THE WEB SITES.","EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE, ITALY;ROMA TRE UNIVERSITY, ITALY","EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE,ITALY","VAN OS R, 2007, DOI 10.1080/14616690701412871; VAN AELST P, 2002, DOI 10.1080/13691180208538801; BENNETT W, 2003, DOI 10.1080/1369118032000093860a; DELLA PORTA D, 2005, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500116; ZITTEL T, 2003, DOI 10.1080/1357233042000246855; MOSCA L, 2009, DOI 10.1057/9780230240865_9; BRUSZT L, 2005, DOI 10.1017/s0143814x05000243; DELLA PORTA D, 2005, DOI 10.1017/s0143814x05000255; GIBSON R, 2000, DOI 10.1177/089443930001800306; RÖMMELE A, 2003, DOI 10.1177/135406880391002; PORTA D, 2005, DOI 10.17813/maiq.10.1.vg717358676hh1q6",21,2009,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA STUDIES; LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE",PUB.1046117629,ISI,EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE;ROMA TRE UNIVERSITY,EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE,NA,"DELLA PORTA D, 2009, INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY","DELLA PORTA D, 2009, INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY",ITALY; ITALY,10.1080/13691180802109063,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1046117629,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

IT AIMS TO SUGGEST EXAMPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP CURB THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DUMPING IN GHANA. RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC E‐WASTE AND SCAVENGING ACTIVITIES AND ITS IMPACT ON INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IS ANALYZED. FURTHERMORE, FINDINGS ON RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE INTEREST IN THIS MENACE ARE REVIEWED. THERE IS ALSO A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECT OF OTHER IMPORT/EXPORT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TANTAMOUNT TO DUMPING. ONE CAN OFTEN OBSERVE IGNORANT SCAVENGERS AROUND “RECYCLING SITES” DEMARCATING THEIR PORTIONS OF THE WASTE WHICH INCLUDES DISCARDED COMPUTERS, TELEVISIONS, MICRO‐WAVES, RADIO SETS, AND VCR AMONGST OTHERS. THESE WASTES ARE OFTEN CARRIED TO STRATEGIC POINTS WHERE THESE PEOPLE THEY EXTRACT SOME “VALUABLE” COMPONENTS. IT IS KNOWN THAT MNCS FIND IT EXPENSIVE TO RE‐CYCLE THESE WASTES IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES, THEREBY DIVERSIFYING THEM TO “NEW MARKETS” OFTEN TERMED AS “BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE”. THE HAZARDS INVOLVED DO NOT ONLY AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO THE HEALTH OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS THE INCREASE OF INFERIOR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS SECOND‐HAND GOODS IN THE COUNTRY. GOVERNMENTS CAN SET IMPORT RESTRICTIONS, THE PRESSURE GROUPS CAN HELP TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS. EDUCATING THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE HEALTH HAZARDS IN E‐WASTE BECOMES NECESSARY. PROPER DISPOSAL AND RE‐CYCLING ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND COLLABORATED BY MNCS. THIS PAPER CAN BE SEEN AS AN INITIAL ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE THE EFFECT OF DUMPING AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM STAKEHOLDERS TO ENFORCE MNCS AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES TO BE SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE IN THE GHANAIAN BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.","VAASA UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES, FINLAND","VAASA UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES,FINLAND","KETOLA T, 2006, DOI 10.1002/csr.113; SCHOENUNG J, 2004, DOI 10.1162/1088198043630496",9,2009,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1016645720,ISI,VAASA UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES,VAASA UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES,NA,"NDZIBAH E, 2009, MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL","NDZIBAH E, 2009, MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL",FINLAND,10.1108/14777830910950667,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1016645720,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, A NEW SET OF WEB INDICATORS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED, OBTAINED MAINLY FROM DATA GATHERED FROM SEARCH ENGINES, THE NEW MEDIATORS OF SCHOLARLY COMMUNICATION.   FINDINGS IT WAS FOUND THAT THREE LARGE GROUPS OF INDICATORS ARE FEASIBLE TO OBTAIN AND RELEVANT FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES: ACTIVITY (WEB PUBLICATION); IMPACT (VISIBILITY) AND USAGE (VISITS AND VISITORS). AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT, A RANKING WEB OF UNIVERSITIES HAS BEEN BUILT WITH WEBOMETRICS DATA. THERE ARE TWO RELEVANT FINDINGS: RANKING RESULTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OBTAINED BY OTHER BIBLIOMETRIC‐BASED RANKINGS; AND THERE IS A CONCERNING DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES, WHICH APPEAR IN LOWER POSITIONS WHEN COMPARED WITH THEIR USA AND CANADA COUNTERPARTS.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS CYBERMETRICS IS STILL AN EMERGING DISCIPLINE, SO NEW DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD BE EXPECTED WHEN MORE EMPIRICAL DATA BECOME AVAILABLE.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PROPOSED APPROACH SUGGESTS THE PUBLICATION OF TRULY ELECTRONIC JOURNALS, RATHER THAN DIGITAL VERSIONS OF PRINTED ARTICLES. ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, SUCH AS RAW DATA AND MULTIMEDIA FILES, SHOULD BE INCLUDED ALONG WITH OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION ARISING FROM MORE INFORMAL ACTIVITIES. THESE REPOSITORIES SHOULD BE OPEN ACCESS, AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE PUBLIC WEB, INDEXED BY THE MAIN COMMERCIAL SEARCH ENGINES.

THIS INTEREST IS GROWING DUE TO THE ADVANCE TOWARD A GLOBAL ECONOMY, BECAUSE EDUCATION IS COMMONLY REGARDED AS THE BEST WAY TO MAINTAIN A REGION’S COMPETITIVENESS. THUS, WE HAVE RECENTLY WITNESSED A GREAT DEVELOPMENT OF E-LEARNING (TAKEN AS A SYNONYM FOR WEB-BASED LEARNING, OR LEARNING THROUGH AN INTERNET-ENABLED COMPUTER) TO THE POINT THAT USING THE INTERNET TO DELIVER EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL HAS PRACTICALLY DISPLACED THE EARLY INITIATIVES BASED ON POSTAL MAIL, RADIO, OR TELEVISION. THE INITIAL EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET LED TO ENVISAGING A MASSIVE ADOPTION OF E-LEARNING SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER, AS PROVED BY DATA FROM INTERNET WORLD STATS (HTTP://WWW.INTERNETWORLDSTATS. COM), THE PENETRATION OF THE INTERNET IN HOMES HAS BEEN RATHER LIMITED (AROUND 35% IN EUROPE AND 67% IN THE USA), SO IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PENETRATION OF E-LEARNING HAS BEEN LIMITED TOO. THIS IS INDEED ONE CONSEQUENCE OF THE SOCALLED DIGITAL DIVIDE, THAT IS, THE SEPARATION BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO MAKE FREQUENT USE OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THOSE WHO HAVE NO ACCESS TO THEM OR, EVEN HAVING ACCESS, LACK THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE TO USE THEM. A DIVIDE IN THE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY CAN LEAD TO INEQUALITIES IN THE ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION, POSING RISKS OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION. TO PREVENT THAT, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED LARGE-SCALE INITIATIVES, LIKE THE WORLD SUMMIT ON THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AND THE I2010 PLAN, THAT AIM AT MAKING TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE, AT ANYTIME AND FROM ANYWHERE. AS A CORNERSTONE, THESE INITIATIVES PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESS PLATFORMS DIFFERENT FROM THE PC, WITH SPECIAL INTEREST IN HARNESSING THE INTERACTIVE FEATURES OF DEVICES THAT HAVE ATTAINED GREATER PENETRATION IN SOCIETY. THIS INCLUDES THE NEW DIGITAL TV SET-TOP BOXES, WHICH BEAR THE TERM T-LEARNING, AND THE MODERN MOBILE DEVICES (E.G., MOBILE TELEPHONES AND MEDIA PLAYERS), WHICH SET THE FOUNDATIONS FOR M-LEARNING. THE VISION, AS REPRESENTED IN FIGURE 1, IS THAT THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, COMBINED WITH SUITABLE PEDAGOGICAL AND ANDRAGOGICAL APPROACHES, WILL ENABLE A SCENARIO OF UBIQUITOUS AND LIFELONG LEARNING, FREEING PEOPLE FROM TIME AND PLACE CONSTRAINTS, AND OFFERING FLEXIBLE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TO INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES TECHNICAL, METHODOLOGICAL, AND EDUCATIONAL ISSUES THAT MAKE T-LEARNING AND M-LEARNING SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM PREVIOUS WORKS ON E-LEARNING. WE ALSO REVIEW DEVELOPMENTS IN BOTH AREAS TO FINALLY DISCUSS PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF MUCH RESEARCH IN THE NEAR FUTURE.","UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN","UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO,SPAIN","PAZOS‐ARIAS J, 2006, DOI 10.1002/spe.719; REMAGNINO P, 2005, DOI 10.1007/b100343; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; SPERRING S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/10447310701821590; CHORIANOPOULOS K, 2007, DOI 10.1145/1279540.1279544; REMAGNINO P, 2005, DOI 10.1007/0-387-22991-4_1; BANDELLONI R, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2003.11.007; TRIFONOVA A, 2005, DOI 10.1109/percomw.2005.39; ZHAO L, 2002, DOI 10.1109/istas.2002.1013823; VEDULA I, 2003, DOI 10.1109/icalt.2003.1215015; LEKAKOS G, 2007, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59904-361-6",0,2009,CREATIVE ARTS AND WRITING; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; SCREEN AND DIGITAL MEDIA,PUB.1011373159,ISI,UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO,UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO,NA,"KHOSROW-POUR M, 2009, NA","KHOSROW-POUR M, 2009, NA-a",SPAIN,10.4018/978-1-60566-026-4.ch184,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1011373159,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

YATES D; GULATI G; TAWILEH A,EXPLAINING THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE: THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES ON DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY AND ICT DEVELOPMENT,NA,NA,ARTICLE,NA,NA,"THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (TCL'S) OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS HAS CREATED AN ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE TO HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO TELECOMMUNICATION AND INTERNET SERVICES. MUCH OF THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THESE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES HAVE MOSTLY EXACERBATED EXISTING INEQUALITIES BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING NATIONS AND CREATED NEW INEQUALITIES WITHIN SOCIETIES BETWEEN THE INFORMATION RICH AND POOR. THERE SEEMS TO BE VERY LITTLE RESEARCH, HOWEVER, THAT PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE GLOBAL DIGITAL DIVIDE AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL PUBLIC POLICY INITIATIVES THAT SEEK TO EXPAND ACCESS TO TCL'S. MOST OF THESE STUDIES HAVE TENDED TO BE EITHER LARGELY DESCRIPTIVE, QUALITATIVE CASE STUDIES, OR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES THAT HAVE HAD A VERY NARROW CONCEPT OF ICT S. OUR RESEARCH EXAMINES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY ANALYZING THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL POLICIES IN THE FORM OF STRATEGIC PLANNING, REGULATION AND INVESTMENT ON THE INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNION'S DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY INDEX AND ICT ACCESS AND USE INDICATORS IN APPROXIMATELY 150 COUNTRIES. OUR MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT WHEN CONTROLLING FOR MEASURES OF ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, THERE IS GREATER DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY AND GREATER OVERALL TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND USE IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE COMPETITION TO PROVIDE BASIC TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES AND MAKE A HIGHER FINANCIAL INVESTMENT IN ICT DEVELOPMENT.",NA,NA,"MENG Q, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00070-1; SCHECH S, 2002, DOI 10.1002/jid.870; BEILOCK R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00100-3; SREEKUMAR T, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0163443707081692; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; QURESHIL S, 2009, DOI 10.4018/jebr.2009010106; ZHAO H, 2007, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2007040102; WEAVER D, 1985, DOI 10.1111/j.1460-2466.1985.tb02237.x; ROBISON K, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0049-089x(02)00004-2; FORESTIER E, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00061-7; AVGEROU C, 1998, DOI 10.1080/02681102.1998.9525288; PICK J, 2008, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20095; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; CHINN M, 2006, DOI 10.1093/oep/gpl024; HEEKS R, 2008, DOI 10.1109/mc.2008.192; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; GUILLEN M, 2005, DOI 10.1353/sof.2006.0015; VAN DIJK J, 2000, DOI 10.4135/9781446218891.n10; AZARI R, 2009, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2009.478; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; BIMBER B, 2003, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511615573; VALK M, 2005, DOI 10.3362/9780855987275; SERVON L, 2002, DOI 10.1002/9780470773529",8,2010,NA,PUB.1095115038,ISI,NA,NOTREPORTED,NA,"YATES DJ, 2010, NA","YATES DJ, 2010, NA",USA; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1109/hicss.2010.196,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1095115038,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

FURTHER, IT GAVE THE RESEARCHERS ENOUGH ROOM TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THE REASONS BEHIND INTRODUCING THE INTERMEDIARY CONCEPT IN THE E‐GOVERNMENT CONTEXT AND PROVIDED CONSIDERABLE FLEXIBILITY DURING INTERVIEWS AND OBSERVATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PAPER INDICATE THAT DIGITAL DIVIDE AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONDUCT PAYMENTS (SECURE TRANSACTIONS) FOR E‐GOVERNMENT SERVICES WAS HINDERING CITIZENS' ADOPTION OF E‐SERVICES IN SAUDI ARABIA. THUS, THE INTERMEDIARY CONCEPT WAS FACILITATING CITIZENS' ACCESS TO E‐GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND HELPING TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SAUDI ARABIA. THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT INTERMEDIARIES HELPED IN INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF E‐GOVERNMENT SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, THIS PAPER FINDS THAT TRUST BETWEEN THE SERVICE PROVIDER (GOVERNMENT) AND SERVICE REQUESTER (CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES) IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR THAT INFLUENCES NOT ONLY E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION AND DIFFUSION, BUT ALSO THE ROLE OF ELECTRONIC INTERMEDIARY (E‐OFFICES) IN FACILITATING THIS ADOPTION. THE AUTHORS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE MOST SALIENT ADOPTION FACTORS WHEN INTRODUCING E‐GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. ELECTRONIC INTERMEDIARIES MAY HELP TO ENHANCE THE UNDERSTATING AND ANALYSIS OF THOSE ADOPTION FACTORS IN GOVERNMENT SETTINGS AND FACILITATE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS IN REALIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERMEDIARIES' ROLE IN E‐GOVERNMENT CONTEXTS. FURTHERMORE, THIS PAPER SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTES TO THE KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE OF E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION AND DIFFUSION AND PROVIDES SUFFICIENT SUPPORT TO DECISION MAKERS IN EXPEDITING E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION AND DIFFUSION.","BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM","BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON,UNITED KINGDOM","CHEN H, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0167-9236(02)00118-5; RICHARDS K, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2006.08.005; CARTER L, 2008, DOI 10.1108/17506160810902167; GEFEN D, 2005, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2005010103; LEE S, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1089107.1089112; SARKAR M, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0148-2963(97)00064-7; CAVAYE A, 1996, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.1996.tb00015.x; AL-FAKHRI M, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2008040105; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001; PAN S, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2004.12.001; VIRILI F, 2009, DOI 10.1108/17506160910979342; AKMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.12.001; CARTER L, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9103-6; DAWES S, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.11.001; VAN DAM N, 2005, DOI 10.1007/11407546_18; EBRAHIM Z, 2005, DOI 10.1108/14637150510619902; SARIKAS O, 2007, DOI 10.1108/17506160710751986; TEO T, 2008, DOI 10.2753/mis0742-1222250303; CARTER L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x; EVANGELIDIS A, 2002, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-46138-8_64; WHITSON T, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00062-4; DEAKINS E, 2002, DOI 10.1108/09513550210435728; CRIADO J, 2003, DOI 10.1108/09513550310472320; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.003; BEYNON-DAVIES P, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2004.08.002; LAM L, 2005, DOI 10.1108/17410390510623981; ZHANG J, 2005, DOI 10.1108/17410390510624007; GELLMAN R, 1996, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(96)90002-7; PHIPPEN A, 2007, DOI 10.4018/jcec.2007070105; BAILEY J, 1997, DOI 10.1080/10864415.1997.11518287; MOON M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00196; HEEKS R, 2002, DOI 10.1080/01972240290075039; ALDRICH D, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(02)00130-2; CHEN Y, 2006, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2006010102; GRIMSLEY M, 2007, DOI 10.1108/17506160710751995; ROTTER J, 1967, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1967.tb01454.x; SAFAI-AMINI M, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s1352-0237(00)00180-5; LAYNE K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00066-1; AL-TAWIL K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00036-2; NORRIS D, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00431.x; EHRLICH K, 1999, DOI 10.1023/a:1008696415354; HEEKS R, 2005, DOI 10.1017/s0143814x05000206; BEYNON-DAVIES P, 2003, DOI 10.1080/0268396032000101180; WARKENTIN M, 2002, DOI 10.1080/101967802320245929; SILCOCK R, 2001, DOI 10.1093/pa/54.1.88; MEDJAHED B, 2003, DOI 10.1109/mic.2003.1167340; EYOB E, 2004, DOI 10.1504/eg.2004.004140; KOSTOPOULOS G, 2004, DOI 10.1504/eg.2004.005553; SHAFI A, 2007, DOI 10.1504/eg.2007.015037; AL-SHAFI S, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jcit.2008070103; LAM J, 2005, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2005.127; SINAWONG S, 2009, DOI 10.1109/icds.2009.30; BÉLANGER F, 2006, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2006.464; WANG J, 2004, DOI 10.1109/cit.2004.1357326; NDOU V, 2004, DOI 10.1002/j.1681-4835.2004.tb00117.x; PAVLOU P, 2006, DOI 10.2307/25148720; GRIFFIN D, 2003, DOI 10.3233/ip-2002-0019",41,2010,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1051813703,ISI,BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON,BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON,NA,"AL‐SOBHI F, 2010, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY","AL‐SOBHI F, 2010, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/17506161011028786,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1051813703,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ICT AND HUMAN RESOURCES IN SPANISH FIRMS, IN THE CONTEXT OF A DEVELOPED COUNTRY WITH AN INCIDENCE-RATE OF ICT SLIGHTLY BELOW THE AVERAGE OF ITS AREA. THE DATA ON 1,269 SPANISH MANUFACTURING FIRMS HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THE SURVEY OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES (SBS) OF THE FUNDACIN EMPRESA PBLICA (SPANISH FOUNDATION) OF SPAIN. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ICT ARE RELATED TO HIGHER LEVELS OF QUALIFICATION, HIGHER LEVELS OF R&D WORKERS, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF TRAINING PER WORKER. MOREOVER, FIRMS THAT INVEST IN ICT OFFER HIGHER LEVELS OF AVERAGE WAGES. THESE RESULTS CONFIRM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND ORGANIZATIONAL AND HUMAN CHANGES. MANAGERS AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SUCH MUTUAL INTERRELATIONS IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THEIR DECISIONS CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN HUMAN AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES.","UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA, SPAIN","UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA,SPAIN","BORGHANS L, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01064.x; BORGHANS L, 2011, DOI 10.1080/00036846.2010.493138; BORGHANS L, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.euroecorev.2006.06.001; BATTISTI G, 2007, DOI 10.1080/10438590600984026; HARGADON A, 2005, DOI 10.1108/10878570510572635; ARABSHEIBANI G, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.0036-9292.2004.05101005.x; COZZARIN B, 2006, DOI 10.1080/10438590500222691; KATRAK H, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0305-750x(97)00051-x; HUSSAIN Z, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2006.10.006; ANDERSEN T, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00081-7; VINDING A, 2006, DOI 10.1080/10438590500513057; AL-GAHTANI S, 2004, DOI 10.1080/1097198x.2004.10856364; MILGROM P, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0165-4101(94)00382-f; BERNDT E, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01596-r; FALK M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/01437720110386421; ARVANITIS S, 2001, DOI 10.1080/10438590100000015; LANDRY B, 2005, DOI 10.1108/09534810510589561; HOSKINS M, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0165-1765(00)00268-8; BAYO-MORIONES A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2007.01.003; ATTARAN M, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0378-7206(03)00098-3; SPANOS Y, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00141-0; HUNTER L, 2003, DOI 10.1177/001979390305600202; DÍAZ M, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0925-5273(01)00115-3; JUHN C, 1993, DOI 10.1086/261881; GALOR O, 2000, DOI 10.1162/003355300554827; CARD D, 2001, DOI 10.1162/00335530151144140; CAROLI E, 2001, DOI 10.1162/003355301753265624; BRESNAHAN T, 2002, DOI 10.1162/003355302753399526; DOMS M, 1997, DOI 10.1162/003355397555181; GOLDIN C, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555720; ACEMOGLU D, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555838; AUTOR D, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555874; MACHIN S, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555883; BERMAN E, 1998, DOI 10.1162/003355398555892; BARTEL A, 2007, DOI 10.1162/qjec.2007.122.4.1721; ZWICK T, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0027950103184001009; AGHION P, 1999, DOI 10.1257/jel.37.4.1615; CHWELOS P, 2001, DOI 10.1287/isre.12.3.304.9708; PREMKUMAR G, 1994, DOI 10.1287/isre.5.2.75; ORLIKOWSKI W, 1996, DOI 10.1287/isre.7.1.63; ANDERSON M, 2006, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.1060.0542; FERNANDEZ Z, 2006, DOI 10.1504/ijtm.2006.009234; BARTEL A, 1987, DOI 10.2307/1937894; KATZ L, 1992, DOI 10.2307/2118323; BERMAN E, 1994, DOI 10.2307/2118467; KRUEGER A, 1993, DOI 10.2307/2118494; COHEN W, 1990, DOI 10.2307/2393553; BOUND J, 1992; AUTOR D, 2001, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.272691; FRANCALANCI C, 1998, DOI 10.2307/249396; HSIEH H, 2008, DOI 10.2307/25148830",12,2010,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1027767223,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA;UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA,UNIVERSITY OF ZARAGOZA,NA,"GALVE-GRRIZ C, 2010, JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH","GALVE-GRRIZ C, 2010, JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH",SPAIN,10.4067/s0718-18762010000100003,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1027767223,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

CHARACTERISING THE NATURE OF MEDIA-USER BEHAVIOUR AND DISTINCTIVE USER TYPES IS CHALLENGING AND THE LITERATURE OFFERS LITTLE GUIDANCE IN THIS REGARD. HENCE, THE PRESENT RESEARCH AIMS TO CLASSIFY DIVERSE USER BEHAVIOURS INTO MEANINGFUL CATEGORIES OF USER TYPES, ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF USE, VARIETY OF USE AND CONTENT PREFERENCES. TO REACH A COMMON FRAMEWORK, A REVIEW OF THE RELEVANT RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED. AN OVERVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE (22 STUDIES) REGARDING USER TYPOLOGY WAS ESTABLISHED AND ANALYSED WITH REFERENCE TO (1) METHOD, (2) THEORY, (3) MEDIA PLATFORM, (4) CONTEXT AND YEAR, AND (5) USER TYPES. BASED ON THIS EXAMINATION, A UNIFIED MEDIA-USER TYPOLOGY (MUT) IS SUGGESTED. THIS INITIAL MUT GOES BEYOND THE CURRENT RESEARCH LITERATURE, BY UNIFYING ALL THE EXISTING AND VARIOUS USER TYPE MODELS. A COMMON MUT MODEL CAN HELP THE HUMAN–COMPUTER INTERACTION COMMUNITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND BOTH THE TYPICAL USERS AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF MEDIA-USAGE PATTERNS MORE QUALITATIVELY. DEVELOPERS OF MEDIA SYSTEMS CAN MATCH THE USERS’ PREFERENCES MORE PRECISELY BASED ON AN MUT, IN ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING THE TARGET GROUPS IN THE DEVELOPING PROCESS. FINALLY, AN MUT WILL ALLOW A MORE NUANCED APPROACH WHEN INVESTIGATING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEDIA USAGE AND SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.","SINTEF, NORWAY","SINTEF,NORWAY","HEIM J, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807076971; HERMANN F, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-73105-4_89; DHAVAN VSHAH N, 2001, DOI 10.1080/105846001750322952; SHIH C, 2004, DOI 10.1509/jmkg.68.1.59.24029; FARQUHAR L, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00370.x; KAU A, 2003, DOI 10.1108/07363760310464604; BARNES S, 2007, DOI 10.1108/03090560710718120; DEYOUNG C, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(03)00045-1; KOZINETS R, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0263-2373(99)00004-3; CAMPBELL S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807075016; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x; OBRIST M, 2008, DOI 10.1145/1358628.1358692; JEPSEN A, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13527260600694308; SWINYARD W, 2003, DOI 10.1002/mar.10087; SHEEHAN K, 2002, DOI 10.1080/01972240252818207; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; WHITLEY B, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(96)00026-x; JOHNSON G, 2007, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.0043; HOWARD P, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121957259; SELWYN N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0267323105049631; JENSEN K, 1990, DOI 10.1177/0267323190005002005; ARNDT J, 1983, DOI 10.2307/1251407; BUNN M, 1993, DOI 10.2307/1252056; BOZEMAN B, 1983, DOI 10.2307/3323627; BACHARACH S, 1989, DOI 10.5465/amr.1989.4308374; RICH P, 1992, DOI 10.5465/amr.1992.4279068; DOTY D, 1994, DOI 10.5465/amr.1994.9410210748; BRANDTZÆG P, 2009, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0152; ROBERTS D, 2003, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139165112; BRANDTZÆG P, 2008, DOI 10.4108/icst.intetain2008.2481; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; WATSON-MANHEIM W, 2007, DOI 10.2307/25148791; BOWKER G, 2000, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/6352.001.0001; DECKER R, 2021, DOI 10.6339/jds.2006.04(2).251",130,2010,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1048305380,ISI,NA,NOTREPORTED,NA,"BRANDTZÆG PB, 2010, COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR","BRANDTZÆG PB, 2010, COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR",NORWAY,10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.008,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1048305380,NA,NA,NA,"THE RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY,RCN,OSLO,NORWAY;EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

IT CONSIDERS INCLUSIVE STAKEHOLDER ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES THAT COULD ADDRESS UNMET NEEDS.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH ALTHOUGH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC), MEMBER STATES, LOCAL AUTHORITIES, INDUSTRY, AND RESEARCHERS HAVE CALLED FOR GREATER COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIPS AMONG STAKEHOLDERS TO OVERCOME THE SO‐CALLED DIGITAL DIVIDES, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIV]EN TO THE FORM OF COLLABORATION. REVIEWING VARIOUS POLICY‐ORIENTED DOCUMENTS, THIS PAPER COMPILES A LIST OF PRINCIPAL STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR E‐INCLUSION NEEDS, REVIEWS EXISTING MULTI‐STAKEHOLDER UNDERTAKINGS AND PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURES AS CANDIDATES FOR ADDRESSING NEEDS NOT ALREADY MET.   FINDINGS MANY IMPORTANT E‐INCLUSION NEEDS ARE NOT ADDRESSED BY ANY MULTI‐STAKEHOLDER UNDERTAKING. SOME STRUCTURED COLLABORATION OR PARTNERSHIP SHOULD ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. A NEW STRUCTURE SHOULD NOT MERELY REPRESENT ALL INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS, BUT INVOLVE THEM IN DECISION‐MAKING PROCESSES.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS IS A CONCEPTUAL PAPER, CONSTRAINED BY LENGTH FROM PRODUCING A DETAILED LIST OF NEEDS. SIMILARLY, ALTHOUGH THE PAPER IDENTIFIES 12 DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES, SOME COULD BE FURTHER SEGMENTED.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FURTHER RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS COULD BE UNDERTAKEN SOURCING EACH IDENTIFIED NEED, PERHAPS ADDING OTHERS AND FURTHER SEGMENTING STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER IS OF VALUE TO STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED OR INTERESTED IN E‐INCLUSION EFFORTS. IT USES A NOVEL, STRAIGHT‐FORWARD, APPROACH FOR IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS AND NEEDS, WHO CAN MEET THOSE NEEDS AND WHO IS ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS.","TRILATERAL RESEARCH & CONSULTING, UNITED KINGDOM","TRILATERAL RESEARCH & CONSULTING,UNITED KINGDOM","MYNATT E, 2001, DOI 10.1007/s12126-001-1014-5; ABASCAL J, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2005.03.002; STEPHANIDIS C, 1998, DOI 10.1207/s15327590ijhc1002_2; GRAY J, 2007, DOI 10.1088/1126-6708/2007/07/023; NEUFELDT A, 2007, DOI 10.1080/01972240701323580; MELENHORST A, 2001, DOI 10.1177/154193120104500305; ROGERS W, 1996, DOI 10.1518/001872096778701935; CARVETH R, 2002, DOI 10.28945/2456",11,2010,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1042353422,ISI,TRILATERAL RESEARCH AND CONSULTING,TRILATERAL RESEARCH AND CONSULTING,NA,"WRIGHT D, 2010, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS IN SOCIETY","WRIGHT D, 2010, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS IN SOCIETY",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/14779961011040587,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1042353422,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS PAPER AIMS TO ILLUSTRATE THAT IF FREE AND/OR OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS TO BE USED AS A BUILDING BLOCK TO BRIDGE THE “DIGITAL DIVIDE” A MORE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE, WHICH EMBRACES THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THE SOFTWARE, NEEDS TO COMPLEMENT THE TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENTAL MODEL IS PRESENTED AS A USEFUL ALTERNATIVE WHICH, IF EMBRACED, CAN INFORM MORE HOLISTIC INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT) POLICIES.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THROUGH A REVIEW OF DIFFUSION OF INNOVATIONS MODELS AN ALTERNATIVE DIFFUSION FRAMEWORK IS DESCRIBED AND APPLIED TO AN INTERPRETIVE OPEN SOURCE CASE STUDY IN SOUTH AFRICA.   FINDINGS CONTEMPORARY DIFFUSION AND INNOVATION MODELS ARE NARROWLY FOCUSED ON IT AS A PURELY TECHNOLOGICAL LINEAR PHENOMENON. THIS PERSPECTIVE ALSO UNDERLIES MANY ICT POLICIES. A MORE SOCIO‐TECHNICAL ADOPTION MODEL CAN ASSIST IN PROVIDING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ICT POLICY DEVELOPMENT.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE APPLICATION OF A NEW INNOVATION MODEL, THE HUMAN ENVIRONMENTAL MODEL, TO ICT POLICY PROVIDES A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INNOVATION PROCESS CAN BE REFLECTED IN POLICY. SUCH AN APPROACH TO ICT POLICY FORMULATION WILL ASSIST WITH BROADENING THE PERSPECTIVE OF POLICY MAKERS FROM IT AS A TECHNICAL SOLUTION TO IT AS PART OF A SOCIO‐TECHNICAL SOLUTION AND RECOGNISE THE DUALITY OF THE INNOVATION PROCESS.","UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA;ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS IN IRELAND, IRELAND","UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA,SOUTH AFRICA","WALSHAM G, 2006, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20020; BYRNE E, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-84822-8_14; WALSHAM G, 1995, DOI 10.1057/ejis.1995.9; FLYVBJERG B, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1077800405284363; AVGEROU C, 2001, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00095.x; BAYER J, 1989, DOI 10.1016/0164-1212(89)90018-6; RUDDIN L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/1077800406288622; PRESCOTT M, 1995, DOI 10.1145/217278.217284; SAHAY S, 1994, DOI 10.1057/ejis.1994.30; JENSEN J, 2001, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00025; LEE A, 2003, DOI 10.1287/isre.14.3.221.16560; MOORE G, 1991, DOI 10.1287/isre.2.3.192; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2000, DOI 10.1287/orsc.11.4.404.14600; BOISOT M, 2004, DOI 10.7238/in3wps.v0i4.869",7,2010,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1009837557,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS IN IRELAND,UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA,NA,"WEILBACH L, 2010, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS IN SOCIETY","WEILBACH L, 2010, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND ETHICS IN SOCIETY",SOUTH AFRICA; IRELAND,10.1108/14779961011024837,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1009837557,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH GLOBALLY AND MOST ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE ADVENT OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES HAS MEANT GREAT CHANGES IN THE MANNER OF THINKING AND DOING THINGS BOTH AT HOME AND IN BUSINESS, IN EDUCATION ESTABLISHMENTS AND IN SOCIETY. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THERE HAS BEEN THE INTRODUCTION OF VARIOUS TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES TO FACILITATE THE INTEGRATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN TEACHING AND ADMINISTRATION OF NEW CURRICULA. THIS PAPER EXAMINES SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS AND THE PROCESS OF KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT OF NUTRITION SCIENCE AND HOME ECONOMICS STUDIES AT THE DELTA STATE UNIVERSITY IN NIGERIA. A STUDY IS UNDERTAKEN OF STUDENTS' LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL ATTAINMENTS AND STUDY APPROACHES.   FINDINGS THE PRESENT STUDY REVEALS THAT SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR SUCCESSFUL ESTABLISHMENT AND USE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. STUDENTS NEED TO HAVE ADEQUATE EXPERTISE IN TECHNOLOGY TO BECOME ACTIVE LEARNERS ARE REPORTED. THIS WILL ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS AND ADDRESS SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS. THIS MUST BE IDENTIFIED AT THE KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING STAGES DURING CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND BE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION FOCUSES ON THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE ON TWO SUBJECT AREAS AND IN ONE COUNTRY. FUTURE WORK INTENDS TO EXTEND THIS TO OTHER DISCIPLINES AND INVESTIGATE WAYS OF ENHANCING EDUCATION PROVISION TO MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF LEARNERS OF MIXED TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITIES AND FROM DIVERSE CULTURES AS APPLIED TO OTHER COMPARATIVE COUNTRIES.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER DRAWS ON RESULTS OBTAINED FROM STUDENTS STUDYING APPROACHES TO PROPOSE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT A CURRICULUM THAT ACTIVELY PROMOTES THE USE OF SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT DEVELOPS SUCH SKILLS AS TEAMWORK, COMMUNICATIONS, PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND LIFELONG LEARNING.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS WORK INVESTIGATES STUDENTS PRESENT TECHNOLOGY ATTAINMENT LEVELS AND CONSIDERS THE DIFFERENT LEARNING AND STUDYING APPROACHES ADOPTED BY STUDENTS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY OF HOME ECONOMIC AND NUTRITION SCIENCE.

IN THE LAST TWO DECADES SCHOLARS HAVE GRADUALLY REFINED THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, MOVING FROM A DICHOTOMOUS MODEL MAINLY BASED ON ACCESS, TO A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN USAGE LEVELS AND ACTORS' PERSPECTIVES. DIGITAL DIVIDE VIEWS TEND TO FOCUS ON GROUPS OF USERS AND USER CHARACTERISTICS AND FOCUS LESS ON DIFFERENT PROCESSES OF USE. AS MODELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BECAME MORE COMPLEX, RESEARCH FOCUSED ON DEEPENING THE UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADOPTERS AND NON-ADOPTERS. WHILE IT LITERACY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH, AND STUDIES EXAMINE USER CHARACTERISTICS WITH RESPECT TO IT LITERACY, FEW STUDIES MAKE THE PROCESS OF BASIC IT LITERACY ACQUISITION THEIR MAIN FOCAL POINT (SELWYN, 2005). THIS PERSPECTIVE FURTHERS OUR THINKING BY EXPANDING THE NOTION OF USER CHARACTERISTICS BEYOND DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES TO DIFFERENCES IN THE PROCESSES LEADING TO INTERNET USE. BASED ON A DATASET REFERRING TO AN ITALIAN REGION, THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN GENERAL AND EXPLORES THE PROCESS OF IT SKILLS ACQUISITION IN PARTICULAR. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THE KEY ROLE OF SELF-LEARNING AND THE PRESENCE OF THREE DISTINCT APPROACHES IN IT SKILLS ACQUISITION LEADING TO DIFFERENT NEEDS IN TERMS OF POLICY. WE ARGUE THAT THESE PRELIMINARY RESULTS ARE A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR THE DESIGN OF MORE EFFECTIVE AND SOPHISTICATED DIGITAL INCLUSION POLICIES.","ISTITUTO SUPERIORE MARIO BOELLA, ITALY;CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY IN GOVERNMENT/SUNY ALBANY, USA, UNITED STATES;CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN Y DOCENCIA ECONÓMICAS, MEXICO","ISTITUTO SUPERIORE MARIO BOELLA,ITALY","FERRO E, 2010, DOI 10.4018/978-1-60566-699-0.ch015; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; GIL-GARCIA J, 2006, DOI 10.1007/11823100_13; VEHOVAR V, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600904076; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.1002/asi.10166; DRORI G, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0894439303021002002; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; WARF B, 2001, DOI 10.1068/b2691; SELWYN N, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0894439304271553; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; BÉLANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; DWIVEDI Y, 2008, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59904-851-2.ch011; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; DHOLAKIA R, 2006, DOI 10.1080/01972240600791374; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0894439308318213; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; RIGGINS F, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00074; STANTON B, 1963, DOI 10.2307/1235767",104,2011,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; HUMAN SOCIETY; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION; INFORMATION SYSTEMS",PUB.1039281789,ISI,ISTITUTO SUPERIORE MARIO BOELLA;CENTER FOR TECHNOLOGY IN GOVERNMENT/SUNY ALBANY;CENTRO DE INVESTIGACIÓN Y DOCENCIA ECONÓMICAS,ISTITUTO SUPERIORE MARIO BOELLA,NA,"FERRO E, 2011, GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY","FERRO E, 2011, GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY",ITALY; MEXICO,10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1039281789,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

AS CULTURAL FACTORS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF IT ADOPTION AND USE, THIS RESEARCH PAPER EXAMINES CULTURE’S IMPACT ON THE ADOPTION AND USE OF IT IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE). THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY WERE COMPARED ALONG EIGHT CULTURAL DIMENSIONS WITH A STUDY ON THE ADOPTION AND USE OF IT IN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS ARE ALSO USED TO IDENTIFY ISSUES THAT CONCERN THE RELATIONSHIP OF CULTURE AND IT AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR IT ADOPTION AND USE IN THE UAE. THE STUDY RESULTS ARE FURTHER USED TO SUGGEST WAYS OF BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THE UAE AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.","TSHWANE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, SOUTH AFRICA;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF OSTRAVA, CZECHIA;UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNIVERSITY, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF OSTRAVA, CZECHIA","TSHWANE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,SOUTH AFRICA","AVISON D, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2007.06.004; HASAN H, 1999, DOI 10.4018/jgim.1999010101; HO K, 2007, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2007100101; AVISON D, 1995, DOI 10.1108/09593849510098262; HOFSTEDE G, 1983, DOI 10.1080/00208825.1983.11656358; HOFSTEDE G, 1985, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-6486.1985.tb00001.x; SHORE B, 1996, DOI 10.1016/s0963-8687(96)80021-7; HOFSTEDE G, 1990, DOI 10.2307/2393392",2,2011,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1038394697,ISI,TSHWANE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF OSTRAVA;UNITED ARAB EMIRATES UNIVERSITY;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF OSTRAVA,TSHWANE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,NA,"DITSA G, 2011, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION","DITSA G, 2011, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY DIFFUSION",SOUTH AFRICA; CZECHIA; UNITED ARAB EMIRATES,10.4018/jtd.2011100102,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1038394697,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THESE LIMITATIONS OFTEN FORCE US TO RETHINK HOW WE DESIGN DISPLAYS FOR GEOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATIONS. WE NEED WAYS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DATA TO BE VISUALIZED AND TRANSMITTED. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE MODERN INSTRUMENTS EFFORTLESSLY PRODUCE LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA AND WEB 2.0 FURTHER ALLOWS BOTTOM-UP CREATION OF RICH AND DIVERSE CONTENT. THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION WE HAVE TODAY FOR CREATING USEFUL AND USABLE CARTOGRAPHIC PRODUCTS IS HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE. HOWEVER, HOW MUCH OF IT CAN WE REALLY USE ONLINE? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE FIRST CALCULATE THE BANDWIDTH NEEDS FOR GEOGRAPHIC DATA SETS IN TERMS OF WAITING TIMES. THE CALCULATIONS ARE BASED ON VARIOUS DATA VOLUMES ESTIMATED BY SCHOLARS FOR DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. DOCUMENTING THE WAITING TIMES CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM.

DESPITE THIS, FEW STUDIES HAVE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENCE OF USE OF THE INTERNET AS AN ADVICE RESOURCE OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH INFORMATION ARENA. WITH AN INCREASING IMPETUS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR TOWARDS THE PROVISION OF ONLINE DELIVERY MECHANISMS FOR CIVIC ORIENTATED ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ADVICE PROVISION, IT IS TIMELY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ONLINE ADVICE SEEKING. FOCUSING ON YOUNG PEOPLE AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 24YEARS, WE INVESTIGATED HOW MUCH THE INTERNET WAS USED TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT EVERYDAY PROBLEMS WITH A LEGAL DIMENSION, WHO USED IT, HOW IT WAS USED AND HOW SUCCESSFUL RESPONDENTS WERE IN SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION ONLINE. DATA WERE EXTRACTED FROM A LARGE-SCALE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY OF ADULTS’ EXPERIENCE OF PROBLEMS WITH A LEGAL DIMENSION CONDUCTED ACROSS ENGLAND AND WALES (10,512 ADULT RESPONDENTS). RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH PROBLEMS, RISING FROM 4% IN 2001 TO AROUND 18% IN 2008. THE RESPONSES OF THE 18–24YEAR OLDS TO THE SURVEY ILLUSTRATED THAT DESPITE HAVING COMPARATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF INTERNET ACCESS, THIS AGE GROUP UTILISED IT TO A LESSER DEGREE THAN SIMILARLY ‘CONNECTED’ AGE COHORTS, AND WERE LESS SUCCESSFUL WHEN DOING SO. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS ASPECTS OF THE SECOND DIGITAL DIVIDE, GOING BEYOND ACCESS TO EXPLORE USE AND OUTCOMES OF USE. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET IN PROVIDING INFORMATION AND ADVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, ARE DISCUSSED.","LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE, LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSION, UK, UNITED KINGDOM;LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE, LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSION, UK, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE, LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSION, UK, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM","LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE, LEGAL SERVICES COMMISSION, UK,UNITED KINGDOM","BENNETT S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x; DINET J, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00093.x; SILLENCE E, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2006.10.002; TYLEE A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(07)60371-7; EYSENBACH G, 2002, DOI 10.1136/bmj.324.7337.573; NICHOLAS D, 2003, DOI 10.1108/00012530310498842; BILAL D, 2002, DOI 10.1002/asi.10145; CHEONG P, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808094356; BORZEKOWSKI D, 2001, DOI 10.1001/archpedi.155.7.813; SILLENCE E, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.11.006; CHEONG P, 2007, DOI 10.1080/07491409.2007.10162513; PUUSTINEN M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2008.07.002; BUCK A, 2007, DOI 10.1515/zfrs-2007-0206; HOWARD P, 2001, DOI 10.1177/00027640121957259; SKINNER H, 2003, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5.4.e32; ATTEWELL P, 2001, DOI 10.2307/2673277",13,2011,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1044479591,ISI,LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE;LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,LEGAL SERVICES RESEARCH CENTRE,NA,"DENVIR C, 2011, INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS","DENVIR C, 2011, INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.intcom.2010.10.004,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1044479591,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO REPORT ON SUCH AN EFFORT, THE DIGITAL LOCAL AGENDA (DLA). IT AIMS TO SHOW THE DLA DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE AND PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF ITS UTILIZATION IN PRACTICE THROUGH A EUROPEAN INITIATIVE.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER EXPLAINS THE RATIONALE FOR THE DLA, AND EXAMINES IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DLA IN PILOT SITES IN FIVE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO SUPPORT CIVIL SERVANTS IN SMALL MUNICIPALITIES, AND EMPOWER THEM TO DEVELOP AND UTILIZE THEIR CAPACITIES TO USE ICTS AND REACH PEOPLE MOST IN DANGER OF EEXCLUSION.   FINDINGS PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DLA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO THE PERSISTENT PROBLEM OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION IN EUROPE. IMPLEMENTING THE DLA MAY IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICE PROVISION AND REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FACED BY DISEMPOWERED GROUPS.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE GIVEN THE FLEXIBLE AND ADAPTABLE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED FOR IN THE DLA, THE PAPER ARGUES THAT THE DLA IS AN EFFECTIVE AND STRATEGIC APPROACH TO TRANSLATE POLICY FRAMEWORKS INTO SOLUTIONS THAT PRACTITIONERS CAN DEPLOY TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF ACCESSING EGOVERNMENT, REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG MARGINALIZED GROUPS IN EUROPE AND INCLUDE ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN DECISION MAKING PROCESSES.","EUROPEAN PROJECTS & MANAGEMENT AGENCY, CZECHIA;NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES, NORWAY","EUROPEAN PROJECTS & MANAGEMENT AGENCY,CZECHIA","MISURACA G, 2010, DOI 10.1145/1930321.1930392",11,2012,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES",PUB.1047445479,ISI,NORWEGIAN ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES,NOTREPORTED,NA,"WALTEROVA I, 2012, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY","WALTEROVA I, 2012, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY",CZECHIA; NORWAY,10.1108/17506161211267419,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1047445479,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IN THIS EDITORIAL, WE REVIEW THEORIES AND FACTORS IMPACTING IMPLEMENTATION, DIFFUSION AND ADOPTION OF E-GOVERNMENT. MOST THEORIES USED IN PRIOR RESEARCH FOLLOW MAINSTREAM INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONCEPTS, WHICH CAN BE CRITICIZED FOR NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT E-GOVERNMENT SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR E-GOVERNMENT SPECIFIC THEORIES AND METHODOLOGIES THAT ADDRESS THE IDIOSYNCRATIC NATURE OF E-GOVERNMENT AS THE WELL-KNOWN INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONCEPTS THAT ARE PRIMARILY DEVELOPED FOR BUSINESS CONTEXTS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO ENCAPSULATE THE COMPLEXITIES SURROUNDING E-GOVERNMENT. ASPECTS LIKE ACCOUNTABILITY, DIGITAL DIVIDE, LEGISLATION, PUBLIC GOVERNANCE, INSTITUTIONAL COMPLEXITY AND CITIZENS' NEEDS ARE CHALLENGING ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN E-GOVERNMENT THEORY AND PRACTICES. AS SUCH, IN THIS EDITORIAL WE ARGUE THAT E-GOVERNMENT SHOULD DEVELOP AS AN OWN STRAND OF RESEARCH, WHILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS THEORIES AND CONCEPTS SHOULD NOT BE NEGLECTED.","SWANSEA UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, NETHERLANDS","SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,UNITED KINGDOM","WEERAKKODY V, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.07.010; TUNG L, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2005.06.001; IRANI Z, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.005; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.001; IRANI Z, 2007, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000698; DWIVEDI Y, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1435417.1435445; JANSSEN M, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.06.005; EBRAHIM Z, 2005, DOI 10.1108/14637150510619902; HAMMER M, 1993, DOI 10.1016/s0007-6813(05)80064-3; WEST D, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x; SHAREEF M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.006; SÆBØ Ø, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.04.007; HAZLETT S, 2003, DOI 10.1108/09604520310506504; JANSSEN M, 2005, DOI 10.1108/17410390510623990; IRANI Z, 2009, DOI 10.1057/jors.2008.100; LAMBRINOUDAKIS C, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0140-3664(03)00082-3; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.003; DWIVEDI Y, 2006, DOI 10.1108/02635570610666458; GUPTA M, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.002; TAN C, 2003, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000479; KAWALEK P, 2005, DOI 10.4018/jgim.2005010104; WEERAKKODY V, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2008100101; KE W, 2004, DOI 10.1145/990680.990687; WILLIAMS M, 2009, DOI 10.1057/jit.2008.30; MOON M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00196; MOSSE B, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2008.00299.x; LAYNE K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00066-1; BASU S, 2004, DOI 10.1080/13600860410001674779; DWIVEDI Y, 2009, DOI 10.1108/02635570910939380; TITAH R, 2006, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2006070102; BEYNON-DAVIES P, 2003, DOI 10.1080/0268396032000101180; WARKENTIN M, 2002, DOI 10.1080/101967802320245929; SILCOCK R, 2001, DOI 10.1093/pa/54.1.88; JØRGENSEN T, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0095399707300703; DELONE W, 1992, DOI 10.1287/isre.3.1.60; ORLIKOWSKI W, 2000, DOI 10.1287/orsc.11.4.404.14600; DWIVEDI Y, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.018874; SHAREEF M, 2009, DOI 10.1504/eg.2009.022594; WEERAKKODY V, 2007, DOI 10.1504/ijeb.2007.012970; AL-SHAFI S, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jcit.2008070103; THONG J, 2000, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2000.11045634; DELONE W, 2003, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2003.11045748; ALTAMEEM T, 2006, DOI 10.1109/innovations.2006.301974; MACINTOSH A, 2004, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2004.1265300; KAMAL M, 2009, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2009.282; QING HU Q, 2006, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2006.481; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008",73,2012,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES",PUB.1007392181,ISI,SWANSEA UNIVERSITY;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON;DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,NA,"DWIVEDI YK, 2012, ACM SIGMIS DATABASE THE DATABASE FOR ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS","DWIVEDI YK, 2012, ACM SIGMIS DATABASE THE DATABASE FOR ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS",UNITED KINGDOM; UNITED KINGDOM; NETHERLANDS,10.1145/2096140.2096142,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1007392181,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

HOWEVER, THE FORMER FOCUSES ON THE CITIZENS THAT USE AND DO NOT USE THIS MEDIUM, WHEREAS THE LATTER STUDIES THE INEQUALITIES RESULTING FROM THE DIFFERENT USES OF THE INTERNET. TAKING SPAIN AS A CASE STUDY, THIS CHAPTER EXAMINES TO WHAT EXTENT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS REDUCED, BY MEANS OF A TIME SERIES ANALYSIS, AND, ON THE OTHER HAND, LOOKS AT A TYPE OF ADVANCED INTERNET USE, E-SHOPPING, TO ANALYSE WHETHER DIGITAL INEQUALITIES HAVE REDUCED OR NOT FROM 2004 TO 2011.

WE ANALYSE THE APPLICATIONS OF MICROROBOTICS AND MACROROBOTICS IN MEDICINE. THEY HAVE BEEN GROUPED INTO THE FOLLOWING AREAS: (1) ROBOTIC SURGERY OR TELESURGERY, (2) PROSTHETICS AND ORTHOTICS AND (3) CARE ROBOTS (ROBOTS FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AND THE ELDERLY, HOSPITAL AND RESEARCH ROBOTS, NANOTECHNOLOGY).THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SHAPING THE PERSONAL AND DOMESTIC ENVIRONMENT. THE NEW VALUES OF SOCIETY, SUCH AS CONCERN FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY, THE IMPORTANCE OF SECURITY, INFORMATION WORKERS OR THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF ENTERTAINMENT AND LEISURE IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE, ARE ELEMENTS THAT GUIDE THE INNOVATION PROCESS. WE CONSIDER THE PROBLEM OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INCLUSIVE SOCIAL MODEL THAT IS BASED ON A NEW WAY OF ORGANISING TECHNOLOGY. THE DIVIDE BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND CONNECTED AND DISCONNECTED COMMUNITIES COULD GET DEEPENED. THE EUROPEAN MODEL OF TRANSITION TO THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY IMPOSES SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE PREVENTION OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE CONDITION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INCLUSIVE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY IS EDUCATION. THE STATE MUST TRANSFORM ITS TRADITIONAL ROLE, AND IT MUST BE A PROVIDER OF INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE SELF-ORGANISATION OF CIVIL SOCIETY. MODERN GENERATIONS HAVE A CULTURE THAT FAVOURS THE INTRODUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR LIVES AND PERCEIVE TECHNOLOGY AS AN OPPORTUNITY OR AN ADVANTAGE RATHER THAN AS A THREAT TO OUR HUMANITY. THIS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR, AND IT IS A NECESSARY CONDITION TO REALISE THE POTENTIAL OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION THAT CHARACTERISES MOST ADVANCED COUNTRIES. ADVANCES IN MEDICAL BIOTECHNOLOGY HAVE PLACED US AT A NEW STAGE. THE MEDICINE INVOLVED WILL BE EMINENTLY PREDICTIVE/PREVENTIVE, AND ROBOTICS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE.","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION, SPAIN;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION, SPAIN","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION,SPAIN","LUM M, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0278364909101795; HOSSEINI M, 2006, DOI 10.1002/rcs.112; MOZER M, 2004, DOI 10.1002/047168659x.ch12; ALDRICH F, 2003, DOI 10.1007/1-85233-854-7_2; BALLANTYNE G, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0039-6109(03)00164-6; MARESCAUX J, 2001, DOI 10.1038/35096636; NAJARIAN S, 2010, DOI 10.3109/03091902.2010.535593; VAN DER PUTTEN E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13645700701820242; KREBS H, 2007, DOI 10.1109/tnsre.2007.903899; VILLOTTE N, 1992, DOI 10.1109/iembs.1992.5761367; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; VILLOTTE V, 1992, DOI 10.1109/iembs.1992.594728; SERVON L, 2002, DOI 10.1002/9780470773529; CASTELLS M, 2001, DOI 10.1007/978-3-322-89613-1",2,2013,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1015353538,ISI,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF DISTANCE EDUCATION,NA,"DÍAZ JA, 2013, NA","DÍAZ JA, 2013, NA",SPAIN,10.1007/978-1-4471-5358-0_7,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1015353538,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

SUCH REVIEW AIMS TO SUGGEST THE SALIENT FACTS ABOUT THE ISSUES OF SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OR ADOPTION OF THE E‐GOVERNMENT SERVICES UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO THE RESEARCHERS.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A TOTAL OF 78 RELEVANT RESEARCH PAPERS REVIEWING AND ANALYSING THE CHALLENGES, BARRIERS, AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS WERE SELECTED FROM A SET OF OVERALL 448 ARTICLES ON E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION RESEARCH. THESE STUDIES WERE COMPREHENSIVELY REVIEWED TO EXAMINE SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND DEMAND‐SIDE CHALLENGES, BARRIERS, AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS EXPLORED BY DIFFERENT STUDIES IN THIS CONTEXT.   FINDINGS  THE FINDINGS INDICATED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS, LACK OF SECURITY AND PRIVACY, LACK OF TRUST, LACK OF RESOURCES, DIGITAL DIVIDE, POOR MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE, LACK OF AWARENESS, LEGAL BARRIERS, LACK OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND RESILIENCE WERE AMONG SOME OF THE MOST COMMONLY EXPERIENCED CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS ACROSS THE RELEVANT STUDIES. MOREOVER, IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPLY‐SIDE (I.E. IMPLEMENTATION) ( C =53) WERE ALMOST THREE TIMES TO THE ONE APPLIED TO THE DEMAND‐SIDE (I.E. ADOPTION) ( C =18). FURTHERMORE, IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT CITIZEN'S SATISFACTION, INFORMATION ACCURACY, SECURITY, AND PRIVACY WERE SOME OF THE CRITICAL FACTORS FOR THE SUCCESS OF E‐GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES.    RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THIS RESEARCH ONLY REVIEWS THE CHALLENGES, BARRIERS AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS AND LEAVING APART MANY OTHER RESEARCH THEMES SUCH AS IMPACT, DIGITAL DIVIDE, SECURITY, PRIVACY, TRUST, AND RISK OF E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION. MOREOVER, THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PARADIGM OF THIS RESEARCH HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS PAPER PRESENTS A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE CHALLENGES, BARRIERS, AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS OF THE E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION RESEARCH BOTH WITH REGARD TO SUPPLY AS WELL AS DEMAND SIDE. SUCH REVIEW ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE NOT ONLY A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE ISSUES EXPERIENCED IN THE E‐GOVERNMENT RESEARCH, BUT ALSO PRESCRIBES THE GUIDELINES FOR THE GOVERNMENTS TO CONSIDER CERTAIN FACTS BEFORE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THEIR E‐GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES. SUCH A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF E‐GOVERNMENT ADOPTION LITERATURE HAS NOT BEEN PERFORMED EARLIER.","SWANSEA UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,UNITED KINGDOM","MIRCHANDANI D, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9102-7; DWIVEDI Y, 2008, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2008.57; HUANG W, 2005, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-348-7.ch013; AXELSSON K, 2010, DOI 10.1108/17506161011081309; SHARIFI H, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jgi.2004.10.005; CIBORRA C, 2005, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20008; DWIVEDI Y, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2096140.2096142; GILBERT D, 2004, DOI 10.1108/09513550410539794; NI A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.005; VAN AERSCHOT L, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13511610802576927; SAHA P, 2010, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-14799-9_18; CHEN H, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2096140.2096145; AKMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.12.001; EBRAHIM Z, 2005, DOI 10.1108/14637150510619902; ELSHEIKH Y, 2008, DOI 10.1108/17506160810876176; FEDOROWICZ J, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2010.511556; WEST D, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x; MISHRA A, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2096140.2096143; SARANTIS D, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s11213-009-9161-9; SANG S, 2009, DOI 10.1108/10662240910998869; LI B, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1089551.1089650; MUTULA S, 2010, DOI 10.1108/02640471011023360; WILLIAMS M, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-6108-2_3; JAEGER P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2003.08.003; LAM L, 2005, DOI 10.1108/17410390510623981; NAGI E, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2009.04.003; STREIB G, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2008100103; WEERAKKODY V, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2008100101; DAWES S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2008.00981.x; KE W, 2004, DOI 10.1145/990680.990687; VAHTERA A, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-85691-9_20; CHOUDRIE J, 2005, DOI 10.1108/17410390510624016; MOON M, 2002, DOI 10.1111/0033-3352.00196; CHANGO M, 2007, DOI 10.1145/1328057.1328138; CHU P, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.01.005; LASSNIG M, 2003, DOI 10.1007/10929179_26; SUBRAMANIAN M, 2008, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2008040102; SHALINI R, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.12.016; PIETERSON W, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2005.12.001; EDMISTON K, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0275074002250255; WIREDU G, 2010, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-14799-9_9; AMAN A, 2011, DOI 10.1108/17506161111173586; BHUIYAN M, 2010, DOI 10.1145/1930321.1930374; RAY S, 2011, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2011070105; BHUIYAN S, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s11115-009-0087-6; NORRIS D, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2005.00431.x; DUGDALE A, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0020852305051687; ANGELOPOULOS S, 2010, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-14799-9_19; HO A, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0275074004264355; MBARIKA V, 2009, DOI 10.1109/tem.2009.2013826; HWANG M, 2004, DOI 10.11610/isij.1501; SLACK F, 2004, DOI 10.1177/0165551504045855; ALSHEHRI M, 2012, DOI 10.14569/ijacsa.2012.030201; BECKER S, 2004, DOI 10.1504/eg.2004.005172; PALANISAMY R, 2004, DOI 10.1504/eg.2004.005551; LAU A, 2004, DOI 10.1504/eg.2004.005552; YANG J, 2005, DOI 10.1504/eg.2005.006648; IM ', 2005, DOI 10.1504/eg.2005.007094; BECKER S, 2005, DOI 10.1504/eg.2005.007782; DWIVEDI Y, 2006, DOI 10.1504/eg.2006.010801; SABER S, 2007, DOI 10.1504/eg.2007.013981; PHUSAVAT K, 2007, DOI 10.1504/eg.2007.014163; WEERAKKODY V, 2007, DOI 10.1504/eg.2007.015040; PHUSAVAT K, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.016125; GORLA N, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.016130; DHILLON G, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.016645; FAISAL M, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.016646; DWIVEDI Y, 2008, DOI 10.1504/eg.2008.018874; MELLOULI S, 2009, DOI 10.1504/eg.2009.024441; ZHANG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1504/eg.2010.030924; BUSAIDY M, 2011, DOI 10.1504/eg.2011.039836; JAIN V, 2011, DOI 10.1504/eg.2011.039837; KAYANI M, 2011, DOI 10.20533/iji.1742.4712.2011.0055; SANG S, 2009, DOI 10.4304/jsw.4.6.529-535; CONKLIN A, 2007, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2007.102; LIU Y, 2010, DOI 10.1109/icsess.2010.5552260; WANG T, 2010, DOI 10.1109/cise.2010.5676832; SINAWONG S, 2008, DOI 10.1109/iccit.2008.401; WANG H, 2010, DOI 10.1109/icmss.2010.5576651; FURUHOLT B, 2008, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2008.134; BERDYKHANOVA D, 2010, DOI 10.1109/itsim.2010.5561596; ABU-SHANAB E, 2010, DOI 10.3233/gov-2009-0204",67,2013,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1011611455,ISI,SWANSEA UNIVERSITY;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY;SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,SWANSEA UNIVERSITY,NA,"RANA NP, 2013, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY","RANA NP, 2013, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/17506161311325350,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1011611455,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

OUR PROPOSED ANALYSIS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS THAT ARGUE THAT THE EXTENT OF USE AND EXPERIENCE HAS GREATER EXPLANATORY POWER THAN THE SIMPLE COMPARISON OF INTER-GENERATIONAL USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.","UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF LISBON, PORTUGAL;UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF LISBON, PORTUGAL","UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF LISBON,PORTUGAL","BENNETT S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01411920902989227; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424843; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; LOOS E, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-21663-3_21; FACER K, 2001, DOI 10.1080/13676260120101905; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782",2,2013,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1035398845,ISI,UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF LISBON;UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF LISBON,UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF LISBON,NA,"LAPA T, 2013, NA","LAPA T, 2013, NA",PORTUGAL,10.1007/978-3-642-39191-0_13,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1035398845,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS STUDY IS AN ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY HOW SOME COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (SUCH AS ATTENTION OR VERBAL MEMORY) MAY DETERMINE THE INTERACTION OF COGNITIVELY IMPAIRED ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH TECHNOLOGY. TWENTY PARTICIPANTS RANGING FROM MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT TO MODERATE ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE WERE ASSESSED BY MEANS OF A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL BATTERY AND WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW SIMPLE COMMANDS FROM AN AVATAR APPEARING ON A TV BY MEANS OF A REMOTE CONTROL, SUCH AS ASKING THE PARTICIPANT TO CONFIRM THEIR PRESENCE OR TO RESPOND YES/NO TO A PROPOSAL TO SEE A TV PROGRAM. THE NUMBER OF CORRECT ANSWERS AND COMMAND REPETITIONS REQUIRED FOR THE USER TO RESPOND WERE REGISTERED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT PARTICIPANTS WITH A BETTER COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL STATE IN SPECIFIC TESTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE IN THE TV TASK. THE DERIVED CONCLUSION IS THAT NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT MAY BE USED AS A USEFUL COMPLEMENTARY TOOL FOR ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS IN THE ADAPTATION OF IT TO THE ELDERLY WITH DIFFERENT COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL PROFILES. FURTHER STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLES ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE TO WHAT EXTENT COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS CAN ACTUALLY PREDICT OLDER USERS’ INTERACTION WITH TECHNOLOGY.","MATIA FUNDAZIOA, SPAIN;MATIA FUNDAZIOA, SPAIN;MATIA FUNDAZIOA, SPAIN;MATIA FUNDAZIOA, SPAIN;MATIA FUNDAZIOA, SPAIN;MATIA FUNDAZIOA, SPAIN","MATIA FUNDAZIOA,SPAIN","NYGÅRD L, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1471301208096631; SALMON D, 2009, DOI 10.1146/annurev.psych.57.102904.190024; BLACKLER A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2009.04.010; CZAJA S, 2001, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.564; LU Y, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1054773806295238; MOSER E, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.10.016; LANGDON P, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10209-007-0082-z; ORTIZ A, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-71025-7_8; FOLSTEIN M, 1975, DOI 10.1016/0022-3956(75)90026-6; TOPO P, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0733464808324019; DYCK M, 2008, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0003628; CARRASCO E, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-70540-6_5; HANSON E, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1471301207081572; SON J, 2007, DOI 10.1177/0898264307308568; LEWIS T, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-1-84800-211-1_10; BERTRAND R, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0898264306289620; HANSON V, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2010.09.001; SLEGERS K, 2009, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x08007629; REISBERG B, 1982, DOI 10.1176/ajp.139.9.1136; LOSADA BALTAR A, 2004, DOI 10.33588/rn.3808.2003522; PILOTTO A, 2011, DOI 10.3233/jad-2010-101164",13,2013,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1043707768,ISI,NOTREPORTED,NOTREPORTED,NA,"DIAZ-ORUETA U, 2013, UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY","DIAZ-ORUETA U, 2013, UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY",SPAIN,10.1007/s10209-013-0288-1,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1043707768,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

THE CAPABILITY OF THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) AMONG ALL PEOPLE LIVING IN THE PERIPHERAL AREAS OF A COUNTRY, IN RELATION TO THE ICT APPLICATIONS INTO THE TRANSPORT SECTOR, KNOWN AS INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS (ITS). IT ALSO EXAMINES THE INTERDEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE DIGITAL AND PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY. FIRSTLY, THE ICT INFRASTRUCTURES AND THEIR ACCESS VIA THE HOUSEHOLDS AND ENTERPRISES SET THE CONDITIONS FOR THE USE OF ITS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EXPANSION OF TRANSPORT NETWORKS AND DECENTRALIZATION OF TRANSPORT FLOWS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF ITS AND ICTS IN GENERAL, AND THE HIGHER SPECIALIZATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF DIGITAL SERVICES. THESE INTERACTIONS ARE ANALYZED IN GREECE, THROUGH INVESTIGATING THE SPATIAL ALLOCATION OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, AT A REGIONAL LEVEL, FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR, DURING 2000-2009. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS IN ROAD PROJECTS IN PERIPHERAL AREAS DOES NOT IMPLY THE BRIDGING OF THE DIGITAL GAP BETWEEN THE METROPOLITAN AREAS (ATHENS AND THESSALONIKI) AND THE REST OF GREECE. THE NEED FOR DESIGNING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL INVESTMENT POLICY IS SUGGESTED TO JOINTLY REINFORCE THE DIGITAL CONVERGENCE AND PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY.","CENTRE FOR PLANNING AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH, GREECE;PANTEION UNIVERSITY, GREECE;PANTEION UNIVERSITY, GREECE;PANTEION UNIVERSITY, GREECE","CENTRE FOR PLANNING AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH,GREECE","ASPROGERAKAS E, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13563470701453737; GIANNOPOULOS G, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00026-2; SIGALA M, 2010, DOI 10.1108/02634501011053559; GRIMES S, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0743-0167(99)00027-3; COHEN G, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00052-0; BANISTER D, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2010.05.001; TSEKERIS T, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11300-011-0193-3; GRIMES S, 2002, DOI 10.1080/0965431022000031266; IOANNIDES Y, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0327.2008.00200.x; TRANOS E, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0969776409340866; TSEKERIS T, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s11066-008-9024-z; BILLÓN M, 2007, DOI 10.1080/09654310701748009; STATHOPOULOS A, 2008, DOI 10.4113/jom.2008.1001; PETERS D, 2003, DOI 10.1080/09654310303638; ANTONOPOULOS C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.12.001; MOKHTARIAN P, 1990, DOI 10.1016/0191-2607(90)90060-j; ARVANITIS S, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2008.09.002; SALOMON I, 1986, DOI 10.1016/0191-2607(86)90096-8; VICENTE M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.12.013; BANISTER D, 2004, DOI 10.1080/0144164042000206060; WIEGMANS B, 2003, DOI 10.1046/j.0017-4815.2003.00231.x; BATTY M, 1997, DOI 10.1016/s0016-3287(97)00018-9; KELLERMAN A, 2004, DOI 10.1080/10630730500064208; CARIS A, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03081060802086397; RUTHERFORD J, 2005, DOI 10.1080/00420980500379529; STATHOPOULOS A, 2009, DOI 10.1049/iet-its.2008.0061; KHAN A, 2009, DOI 10.1049/iet-its.2009.0009; ZOGRAFOS K, 2004, DOI 10.3141/1873-09; ZAVADSKAS E, 2010, DOI 10.3846/jbem.2010.20; BAUBLYS A, 2010, DOI 10.3846/transport.2010.20; JARAŠŪNIENE A, 2006, DOI 10.3846/16484142.2006.9638074; JARAŠŪNIENĖ A, 2007, DOI 10.3846/16484142.2007.9638143; JAKUBAUSKAS G, 2006, DOI 10.3846/16484142.2006.9638075",3,2013,"BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND DESIGN; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; HUMAN SOCIETY; TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAINS; HUMAN GEOGRAPHY; URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING",PUB.1037482231,ISI,CENTRE FOR PLANNING AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH;PANTEION UNIVERSITY;PANTEION UNIVERSITY;PANTEION UNIVERSITY,CENTRE FOR PLANNING AND ECONOMIC RESEARCH,NA,"TSEKERIS T, 2013, JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT LITERATURE","TSEKERIS T, 2013, JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT LITERATURE",GREECE; GREECE,10.1590/s2238-10312013000200016,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1037482231,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

EXPECTATIONS RANGE FROM OVERCOMING STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES TO MORE EFFECTIVE, INTERACTIVE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS. BEFORE MEDICAL HEALTH PRACTICE SUPPORTED BY MOBILE DEVICES (""MHEALTH"") CAN SCALE UP, A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES NEED TO BE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. FROM A PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, HIGH ATTRITION RATES, DIGITAL DIVIDE OF SOCIETY, AND INTELLECTUAL CAPABILITIES OF THE USERS ARE KEY ISSUES WHEN IMPLEMENTING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES. FURTHERMORE, APPS ADDRESSING BEHAVIOR CHANGE OFTEN LACK A COMPREHENSIVE CONCEPT, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR AN ONGOING IMPACT. FROM A CLINICAL POINT OF VIEW, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ALLOW SCALING UP OF MHEALTH INTERVENTIONS. IN ADDITION, NEW CONCEPTS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF INTERVENTIONS. REGARDING TECHNOLOGY INTEROPERABILITY, OPEN STANDARDS AND LOW-ENERGY WIRELESS PROTOCOLS APPEAR TO BE VITAL FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. THERE IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION IN HOW FAR HEALTH CARE-RELATED APPS REQUIRE A CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT AND HOW TO BEST COMMUNICATE QUALITY STANDARDS TO CONSUMERS.

FOLLOWING THE RENEWED DIMENSIONS OF THE TERM, THE NEED FOR UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED DIGITAL DIVIDE INDICATORS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HEIGHTENED ACROSS THE ACADEMIC AND POLICY DISCOURSES. TRADITIONALLY, RESEARCHERS HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THE BELIEF THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS A MERE SEPARATION BETWEEN “HAVE” AND “HAVE NOTS”; HOWEVER, AS THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE INNOVATION IN THE INFORMATION AGE, DIGITAL DIVIDE IS INCREASINGLY BEING UNDERSTOOD AS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL PHENOMENA. THE RESEARCH TO DATE HAS MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THE QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN THE QUANTITATIVE NATURE OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE FEW EXISTENT ACCOUNTS OF QUANTITATIVE STUDIES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ARE OFTEN CRITICIZED FOR DEPLOYING UNRELIABLE DATA IN THEIR ANALYSIS. INACCURATE PREDICTIONS SIGNIFICANTLY DERAIL POLICYMAKERS’ ABILITIES TO FORM APPROPRIATE ACTION PLANS IN COMBATING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.

THIS PAPER SEEKS TO EMPHASIZE THE QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BY REVIEWING THE RELEVANT LITERATURE AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE TOP INDICATORS IN THE FIELD. APART FROM OECD AND ITU, THERE IS A GENERAL LACK OF RESEARCH IN DETERMINING THE ICT INDICATORS.

IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN BOTH LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, WE EMPLOY A MULTI-LEVEL REGRESSION MODEL. WE FIND THAT REGIONAL LEVEL VARIABLES ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN PART OF BROADBAND ACCESS IMPROVEMENT. SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES ARE ERDF EXPENDITURE DEDICATED TO BROADBAND EXPANSION, THE STATUS OF REGIONAL BROADBAND DIFFUSION IN 2008 AND THE NATIONAL DEGREE OF INTER-PLATFORM COMPETITION.

THE INTERNET HAS CERTAIN UNIQUE FACTORS WHICH MAKE EPARTICIPATION AND EGOVERNANCE PARTICULARLY APPEALING, NAMELY THE SIZE AND EXTENT OF THE INTERNET, WHICH ENABLES IT TO BE A MEDIUM WHEREBY INFORMATION CAN BE VERY WIDELY DISPERSED. THIS IN TURN HAS MADE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION EASY ONLINE. HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO A PROPENSITY OF ICT TO BE USED TO INTERFERE WITH OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY. THERE IS A NEED TO FACTOR IN PRESENT AND FUTURE REQUIREMENTS IN THE SCOPE OF EDEMOCRACY AND EGOVERNANCE GENERALLY, AND ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS THE DEVISING OF METHODS TO NARROW THE PREVAILING DIGITAL DIVIDE. THERE IS ALSO MORE NEED FOR CREATION OF ADEQUATE SUPPORT TOOLS TO ENABLE THE USER TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VAST CONTENTS, WHILE ALSO ENGAGING AND INTERACTING IN A MEANINGFUL MANNER WITH OTHERS. FOR EDEMOCRACY TO FLOURISH, WHAT IS NEEDED ARE NEWER VERSIONS OF ICT, INTEREST IN EDEMOCRACY (BOTH BY THE GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC), SUITABLE LEGISLATION, FINANCING, AND A GENERALLY CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ENHANCEMENT OF DEMOCRATIC IDEALS. HOWEVER, BY ITS VERY NATURE, TECHNOLOGY IS NOT INHERENTLY DEMOCRATIC. TO INDULGE IN EPARTICIPATION, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF EPERSONALITY. THIS IN TURN LEADS US TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS AN EPERSON? IN ORDER TO ENABLE THE EPERSONALITY TO FLOURISH, THE AUTHORS PROPOSE THE NEED TO CREATE A PARALLEL ONLINE UNIVERSE, WHERE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES MIRROR THOSE FOUND IN OUR VARIOUS EARTHLY CONVENTIONS AND DECLARATIONS RELATED TO HUMAN, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, BUT WHERE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONLINE WORLD PERSISTS—THEREBY CREATING A SITUATION WHEREIN THE TWAIN SHALL COEXIST BUT NEVER MEET. THIS IS THE CLONED HEAVEN SPECIALLY MADE FOR TRISHANKU, A CONCEPT TAKEN FROM HINDU MYTHOLOGY IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIND THE ANSWER FOR THE FUTURE FROM OUR PAST.","TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, ESTONIA;TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, ESTONIA","TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,ESTONIA","KERIKMÄE T, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-38902-3_1; MEIER A, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-24494-0; MACINTOSH A, 2004, DOI 10.1787/9789264019492-3-en; KERIKMÄE T, 2012, DOI 10.1515/iclr-2016-0077; DUVIVIER K, 2013, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2230124; HOOD C, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-1-137-06154-6",6,2014,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA STUDIES; LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE",PUB.1017059455,ISI,TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,TALLINN UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY,NA,"DUTT PK, 2014, NA","DUTT PK, 2014, NA",ESTONIA,10.1007/978-3-319-08117-5_13,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1017059455,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

ALTHOUGH MORE THAN TWO DECADES HAVE PASSED SINCE THE INITIATION OF E-GOVERNMENT, DIGITAL CHANNEL CHOICE IS STILL BEING QUESTIONED, COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, AND THE LEVEL OF SELECTION WITH CHANNELS IS BEING INVESTIGATED.                                                           DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH                     – THIS STUDY STATES THREE RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT ARE ANSWERED THROUGH A LITERATURE REVIEW AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF A SURVEY IN A DEVELOPED COUNTRY. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT IDENTIFIES THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT CHANNEL CHOICE AND VALIDATES THEM WITH SURVEY RESULTS. TO THIS END, THIS PAPER UTILIZES DATA FROM A NATIONAL CANADIAN SURVEY, WHERE CITIZENS EMPIRICALLY EVALUATED THEIR CHANNEL CHOICE – E-GOVERNMENT, NEW DIGITAL MEDIA AND TRADITIONAL SERVICE CHANNELS – FOR GOVERNMENT CONTACTS.                                                           FINDINGS                     – STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OVER THIS DATA RETURN VALUABLE FINDINGS SUCH AS THAT THE E-GOVERNMENT CHANNEL IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR INFORMATION COLLECTION, WHEREAS TRADITIONAL SERVICE CHANNELS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ESTABLISH INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM SOLVING. MOREOVER, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE APPEARS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON CITIZEN CHANNEL CHOICE. FURTHERMORE, DIGITALLY LITERATE CITIZENS WHO ARE AWARE OF PRIVACY ISSUES ARE MORE LIKELY TO USE NEW DIGITAL MEDIA. FINALLY, CITIZENS ARE QUITE SATISFIED FROM THEIR NEW DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERIENCE, BUT ARE NOT AS SATISFIED WITH THEIR TRADITIONAL CONTACT EXPERIENCE.                                                           ORIGINALITY/VALUE                     – THESE OUTCOMES SHOW THAT E-GOVERNMENT OBSTACLES REGARDING DIGITAL DIVIDE, TRUST AND EFFICIENCY REMAIN ACTIVE AND HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED MORE CAREFULLY BY GOVERNMENTS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT E-GOVERNMENT AND NEW DIGITAL MEDIA ARE NOT SIMPLE CHANNEL CHOICES, BUT ARE COMPLEX IN PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY. THESE OUTCOMES CONFIRM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANNEL CHOICE FOR TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT, AS E-GOVERNMENT APPEARS TO BE A PART OF A BROADER CHANNEL CHOICE AGENDA.","THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO, UNITED STATES;TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE OF THESSALY, GREECE","THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO,UNITED STATES","BÉLANGER F, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.002; CARTER L, 2010, DOI 10.1108/17506161011028777; CARTER L, 2011, DOI 10.1108/17506161111173568; MERGEL I, 2013, DOI 10.1111/puar.12021; EBBERS W, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.11.003; ANTHOPOULOS L, 2014, DOI 10.4018/ijpada.2014010102; VASSILAKIS C, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2006.07.004; CARTER L, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10796-008-9103-6; ANTHOPOULOS L, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2006.07.018; HELBIG N, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.05.004; GAULD R, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2009.12.002; KERNAGHAN K, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0020852305051688; WEST D, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x; NAM T, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0020852312438783; CARTER L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x; CHADWICK A, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1468-0491.00216; DAWES S, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.07.001; TOLBERT C, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2006.00594.x; BELANGER F, 2006, DOI 10.1108/14637150610643751; KERNAGHAN K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/capa.12006; ORGERON C, 2011, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2011070104; ONG C, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.07.005; BERTOT J, 2012, DOI 10.1108/17506161211214831; REDDICK C, 2011, DOI 10.1108/17506161111131195; PARENT M, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2005.10.001; TAIPALE S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.05.005; TSOHOU A, 2013, DOI 10.1108/17506161311325387; REDDICK C, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2004.10.003; LINDERS D, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2012.06.003; REDDICK C, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2011.03.005; FERRO E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.007; TEERLING M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2009.08.003; SINGH A, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.01.001; BÉLANGER F, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1498765.1498801; PIETERSON W, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0020852307085736; PIETERSON W, 2010, DOI 10.4018/jegr.2010040103; HUNG M, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8500.2012.00764.x; WELCH E, 2004, DOI 10.1093/jopart/mui021; MORGESON F, 2010, DOI 10.1093/jopart/muq006; THOMAS J, 2003, DOI 10.1093/jpart/mug010; MONTOYA-WEISS M, 2003, DOI 10.1177/0092070303254408; THOMAS J, 1982, DOI 10.2307/2110940; TAN W, 2000, DOI 10.1080/10864415.2000.11044201; JANSSEN M, 2003, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2003.1174331; PLATTFAUT R, 2013, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2013.585; BÉLANGER B, 2011, DOI 10.2307/41409971; COHEN J, 2006, DOI 10.3233/ip-2006-0083; TEERLING M, 2011, DOI 10.3233/ip-2011-0213",59,2014,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1003861192,ISI,THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO;TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE OF THESSALY,THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT SAN ANTONIO,NA,"REDDICK C, 2014, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY","REDDICK C, 2014, TRANSFORMING GOVERNMENT PEOPLE PROCESS AND POLICY",USA; GREECE,10.1108/tg-01-2014-0001,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1003861192,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH – ENDOGENOUS DEVELOPMENT APPROACH IS USED TO CATEGORIZE THE MAIN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNMENT ICT SUPPORT PROGRAMME. CROSS-TIME ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT BY USING THREE TERRITORIAL INDICATORS OF DIFFUSION AND EFFECTIVE USE OF ICT: THE PHYSICAL ASPECT, REFEREED TO THE INFRASTRUCTURES USED AS A BASE FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT (INFRASTRUCTURES, TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT); THE ACTORS AND THEIR DEGREE OF ORGANIZATION (FIRMS PRESENT ON THE INTERNET AND SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS); AND KNOWLEDGE, REFEREED TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL SPRAWL AND THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP CAPACITY (FOSTERING INNOVATION AND TRAINING AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION AND BUSINESSES).   FINDINGS – THE STUDY CONFIRMS THAT THE PUBLIC POLICIES IMPLEMENTED ARE COHERENT WITH THE ENDOGENOUS DEVELOPMENT APPROACH, WHERE INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY ENABLING MEASURES OF INTERACTION BETWEEN FIRMS AND OTHER ECONOMICAL AGENTS (UNIVERSITIES, BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, BUSINESS CENTRES AND TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTES, ETC.), WITH A VIEW TO FAVOURING THE DISSEMINATION OF INNOVATIONS AND KNOWLEDGE AMONG FIRMS. SECONDLY, THE RESEARCH ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS ICT PROGRAMME, BOTH IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PER CAPITA INCOME, AS WELL AS ON THE MAIN VARIABLES THAT REFLECT THE DEGREE OF BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. RESULTS SHOW THAT, DURING THE PERIOD 1996-2010, THIS REGION HAS MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS IN TERMS OF CONVERGENCE WITH MORE ADVANCED EUROPEAN REGIONS.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS – THE STUDY HAS METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF DESIGNS OF FURTHER ICT PROGRAMMES IN LESS DEVELOPED EUROPEAN REGIONS TO BROKE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS – RECENT OUTLOOKS OF THE OECD CALL FOR MORE ASSESSMENT RESEARCH ON ICT NATIONAL AND REGIONAL POLICIES AROUND THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT PROVE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO BROKE THE INTERNATIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PUBLIC POLICIES FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIVES LAID DOWN BY THE ENDOGENOUS DEVELOPMENT APPROACH CAN REACH THIS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL TARGET. THE ANDALUCÍA INFORMATION SOCIETY PROGRAMME CONSTITUTES A REAL COMMITMENT AND PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP TOWARDS A STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE TECHNOLOGICAL CULTURE AMONGST BUSINESSES. INVESTMENT IN PHYSICAL CAPITAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY MEASURES THAT ENABLE THE INTERACTION OF FIRMS WITH OTHER ECONOMIC AGENTS (UNIVERSITY, BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, TECHNOLOGY CENTRES, ETC.), WITH A VIEW TO FAVOURING THE DISSEMINATION OF INNOVATION AND KNOWLEDGE AMONG FIRMS.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE – THE STUDY USES FOR THE FIRST TIME THE ENDOGENOUS DEVELOPMENT APPROACH APPLIED TO A LESS ADVANCED REGION FOR EVALUATION OF ICT POLICY AND IT IMPROVES A METHODOLOGY BASED ON THIS APPROACH TO ASSESS ITS EFFECTIVENESS.","UNIVERSITY OF VALENCIA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN, SPAIN","UNIVERSITY OF VALENCIA,SPAIN","FLANAGAN K, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2011.02.005; NELSON R, 1997, DOI 10.1080/05775132.1997.11471992; LUCAS R, 1988, DOI 10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7; NAUWELAERS C, 2002, DOI 10.1080/09537320220133866; JORGENSON D, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.jjie.2005.05.001; TÖDTLING F, 1999, DOI 10.1080/09654319908720549; LUNDVALL B, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13662710601130863; FALK R, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2007.01.005; DOZ Y, 2007, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250171006; JALAVA J, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x; HERNÁNDEZ S, 2012, DOI 10.5209/rev_reve.2012.v18.39592; JORGENSON D, 2000, DOI 10.1353/eca.2000.0008; ANANDARAJAN A, 1999, DOI 10.1108/00251749910269375; BERGH P, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s11365-009-0120-9; COLLIS D, 1991, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250120906; MARKIDES C, 2007, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250151010; ALMEIDA P, 1996, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250171113; HARRISSON D, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8292.2011.00452.x; MARTIN S, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00084-0; PICOT A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2007.08.002; ROBINS J, 1995, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250160403; REBELO S, 1991, DOI 10.1086/261764; BLOOM N, 2007, DOI 10.1162/qjec.2007.122.4.1351; JORGENSON D, 2001, DOI 10.1257/aer.91.1.1; OLINER S, 2000, DOI 10.1257/jep.14.4.3; ROMER P, 1994, DOI 10.1257/jep.8.1.3; BARNEY J, 1986, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.32.10.1231; KOGUT B, 1992, DOI 10.1287/orsc.3.3.383; KRAEMER K, 1992, DOI 10.2307/976468",5,2014,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1028323775,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF VALENCIA;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN,UNIVERSITY OF VALENCIA,NA,"AVILA RC, 2014, MANAGEMENT DECISION","AVILA RC, 2014, MANAGEMENT DECISION",SPAIN; SPAIN,10.1108/md-08-2012-0589,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1028323775,NA,NA,NA,"MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS,MINECO,MADRID,SPAIN",DIM

A SURVEY AMONG INMATE POPULATION IN ALL THE FIVE PENITENTIARY CENTERS IN GALICIA, IN THE NORTHWEST OF SPAIN, WAS UNDERTAKEN TO OBTAIN A SAMPLE OF 380INMATES. A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL (SEM) WAS CARRIED OUT TO EXPLAIN PRISONERS’ ICT SKILLS, IN BIAS TO INMATE’S SOCIAL SKILLS, GENERAL SKILLS AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS COLLABORATIVE LEARNING. FOR INMATES, WHO ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR LOW EDUCATION LEVEL, RESULTS SHOWN THE RELEVANCE OF HAVING GENERAL AND SOCIAL SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE ICT SKILLS.

IN A RECENT STUDY WE HAVE EXPLORED THE QUESTIONS: IS THE SOCIETY DIGITALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR PERSONS WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES? HOW DO PERSONS WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES COPE WITH THEIR SITUATION? WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND OBSTACLES THEY FACE? BASED ON THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS WE WANTED TO EXPLORE IF THERE IS A DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CITIZENS IN GENERAL AND THE CITIZENS WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES. AND IF SO; WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS DIVIDE? METHODS USED IN THE STUDY WERE PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH ORIENTED WITH DATA COLLECTION VIA RESEARCH CIRCLES. IN TOTAL OVER 100 PERSONS PARTICIPATED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT A DIGITAL DIVIDE IS PRESENT. PERSONS WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES DIFFER FROM CITIZENS IN GENERAL IN HOW THEY HAVE ACCESS TO DIGITAL RESOURCES. THE RESULT ALSO INDICATES THAT SERVICES AND SYSTEMS ON A SOCIETAL SCALE DO NOT DELIVER THE EXPECTED EFFICIENCY WHEN IT COMES TO SUPPORTING CITIZENS WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE SPECIAL NEEDS THIS GROUP MIGHT HAVE ARE OFTEN NOT IDENTIFIED IN WIDER SURVEYS ON THE CITIZEN’S USE OF INTERNET, DIGITAL SERVICES AND USE OF DIFFERENT TECHNICAL DEVICES. SEVERAL OF THE PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBE THIS AS BEING LEFT OUTSIDE AND NOT FULLY PARTICIPATE IN A SOCIETY WHERE DIGITAL PRESENCE IS CONSIDERED A PREREQUISITE FOR A FULL CITIZENSHIP.","ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN","ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,SWEDEN","LARSSON S, 2001, DOI 10.1080/02601370110036073; RÖNNERMAN K, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-94-6209-722-3_6; ENNIS L, 2012, DOI 10.3109/09638237.2012.689437; LEWIN K, 1946, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1946.tb02295.x; BORG J, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10209-014-0351-6; JOHANSSON S, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2700648.2809849; MCGURK S, 2005, DOI 10.1093/schbul/sbi037; DOBRANSKY K, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600751298; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487",3,2015,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1005112668,ISI,ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,NA,"JOHANSSON S, 2015, NA","JOHANSSON S, 2015, NA",SWEDEN,10.1007/978-3-319-22701-6_31,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1005112668,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

BASED ON THE ICT DEVELOPMENT INDEX (IDI), PROPOSED BY THE UNITED NATIONS, A REGIONAL INDEX (RIDI) IS DEVELOPED TO EVALUATE THE COMPARATIVE IMPACT ON DIFFERENT SPANISH REGIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE REGIONS ARE GROUPED THROUGH CLUSTER ANALYSIS, BASED ON INDICES MEASURING THEIR ICT DEVELOPMENT. HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS WERE EXAMINED BY CALCULATING A DISCRIMINATE REGIONAL INDEX (DIRIDI). IT IS COMPOSED OF HIGHLY DISAGGREGATED INDICATORS CONCERNING SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HOUSEHOLDS AND MUNICIPALITIES, AND ONLY THOSE WHICH HAVE SHOWN TO BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN REGIONS HAVE BEEN SELECTED. THE RESULTS INDICATE A STRONG POLARIZATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ICT, FAVORABLE TO MEDITERRANEAN AND NORTHEAST AREAS, FOR BOTH INDICES CALCULATED.

LOW-EDUCATED EARLY SCHOOL LEAVERS TYPICALLY LACK THE ACCESS, AWARENESS AND ATTITUDE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THESE SKILLS, SUGGESTING A WIDENING DIGITAL DIVIDE OR PARTICIPATION GAP. THIS STUDY PRESENTS RESULTS REGARDING LOW-EDUCATED EARLY SCHOOL LEAVERS’ ATTITUDES TOWARDS SOCIAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL NETWORKS AS A FACTOR THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE CONDITIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT DETERMINE OR ENHANCE THEIR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL MOBILITY AND IMPROVEMENT.

HOWEVER, THIS INCREASED ADOPTION ALSO RAISES SERIOUS ETHICAL ISSUES: VIDEOGAMES ARE ONE OF THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE FORMS OF MULTIMEDIA, AND IF EDUCATION IS TO EMBRACE SERIOUS GAMES, THERE IS AN IMPERATIVE NEED FOR UNIVERSAL ACCESSIBILITY IN SERIOUS GAMES TO PREVENT A DIGITAL DIVIDE. HOWEVER, PRODUCING ACCESSIBLE GAMES IS EXPENSIVE AND EFFORT CONSUMING, AND SERIOUS GAMES DEVELOPMENT ALREADY FARE WITH LIMITED BUDGETS. IN THIS WORK WE EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE (SEMI-) AUTOMATIC ADAPTATION OF GAME INTERFACES AS A WAY TO FACILITATE ACCESSIBLE GAME DEVELOPMENT (AND THUS TRIM THE COST DOWN). WE PROPOSE A GAME INTERFACE MODEL OPTIMIZED FOR POINT-AND-CLICK ADVENTURE GAMES, A POPULAR GENRE AMONG SERIOUS GAMES THAT WE HAVE USED TO PERFORM DIFFERENT SEMI-AUTOMATIC ADAPTATIONS IN A GAME. WE HAVE TESTED THE RESULTING ADAPTED GAME WITH END USERS WITH SPECIFIC DISABILITY PROFILES. OUR TESTS DISCOVERED THAT THE AUTOMATIC ADAPTATIONS PRODUCED USABLE GAMES THAT RETAINED PART OF THEIR ATTRACTIVE, ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT USABILITY ISSUES HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE USER EXPERIENCE. WE ALSO DISCUSS THE ORIGINS OF SUCH LIMITATIONS AND PROPOSE POSSIBLE REMEDIATION ACTIONS, AS WELL AS A REFINED INTERFACE MODEL.","COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN","COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,SPAIN","TORRENTE J, 2014, DOI 10.2298/csis121209013t; TORRENTE J, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-33642-3_17; DICKEY M, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.01032.x; LAW E, 2004, DOI 10.1145/1028014.1028051; GARCIA F, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-07440-5_49; TORRENTE J, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-34478-7_73; YUAN B, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10209-010-0189-5; WUANG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.10.002; GRAMMENOS D, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-73283-9_67; ADAMS D, 2012, DOI 10.1037/a0025595; OSSMANN R, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-70540-6_85; MORENO-GER P, 2012, DOI 10.1155/2012/369637; HUMPHREY J, 1949, DOI 10.1177/002070204900400405; LANCET T, 2011, DOI 10.1016/s0140-6736(11)60844-1; CONNOLLY T, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.03.004; TORRENTE J, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1631111.1631122; HWANG G, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2011.01242.x; BOUTEKKOUK F, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-22714-1_5; GRAMMENOS D, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1486508.1486516; GARRIS R, 2002, DOI 10.1177/1046878102238607; COLES C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.07.001; DICKEY M, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s11423-006-8806-y; PAPASTERGIOU M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2008.06.004; SADLER T, 2013, DOI 10.1002/tea.21085; STANDEN P, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.06.003; WESTIN T, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-21663-3_43; FERNANDEZ A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.infsof.2011.02.007; OSSMANN R, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-70540-6_83; DURKIN K, 2013, DOI 10.1027/2151-2604/a000138; FALB J, 2009, DOI 10.1504/ijwet.2009.028618; LANYI C, 2010, DOI 10.14236/ewic/ihci2010.6",16,2015,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; GRAPHICS, AUGMENTED REALITY AND GAMES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING",PUB.1009978899,ISI,COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,NA,"TORRENTE J, 2015, COMPUTERS & EDUCATION","TORRENTE J, 2015, COMPUTERS & EDUCATION",SPAIN; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.compedu.2015.01.002,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1009978899,NA,NA,NA,"COMUNIDAD DE MADRID,EC,MADRID,SPAIN;EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

THIS STUDY ASSESSES THE COST IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ROLLOUT OF FIXED ACCESS NETWORKS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING CITIZENS WITH DOWNSTREAM BROADBAND CAPACITIES OF 30MBPS OR 100MBPS, WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFINED IN THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL AGENDA AS TARGETS THAT SHOULD BE MET BY 2020. A COST MODEL WAS EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF A HOME PASSED AND THE COST OF A HOME CONNECTED FOR VARIOUS FIBRE- AND COPPER-BASED NETWORKS IN RURAL AREAS. IT WAS FOUND THAT THE COST OF DEPLOYING A NETWORK OUTSIDE A TOWN OR VILLAGE IN A RURAL AREA IS ON AVERAGE 80% HIGHER THAN THE COST OF DEPLOYING THE NETWORK IN THE TOWN OR VILLAGE. THIS SITUATION MAY LEAD TO A DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN THE SAME RURAL AREA. FOR ALL THE GEOTYPES ANALYSED, THE FOLLOWING ORDER OF COSTS (IN DESCENDING ORDER) WAS IDENTIFIED: FTTH, FTTDP-BUILDING, FTTDP-STREET, FTTRN, FTTC AND CO-VDSL. GIVEN THE LONG LENGTHS OF DISTRIBUTION, FEEDER AND DROP SEGMENTS REQUIRED, SOME NETWORK ARCHITECTURES WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN SOME AREAS WITH THE MINIMUM BANDWIDTH OF 30MBPS AS DEFINED IN THE EUROPEAN DIGITAL AGENDA. OVERALL, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OPERATORS WILL NEED TO CREATE A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS BROADBAND ACCESS NETWORKS, DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NETWORKS. POLICYMAKERS WILL NEED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL TOPICS TO PROMOTE THE ROLLOUT OF BROADBAND NETWORKS IN RURAL AREAS: HOW THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITHIN A RURAL AREA CAN BE AVOIDED; A NATIONAL BROADBAND PLAN THAT CLEARLY ADDRESSES THE PROVISIONING OF BROADBAND IN RURAL AREAS; ELABORATION OF STUDIES ON BROADBAND DEMAND IN RURAL AREAS; AND THE ASSESSMENT OF COSTS AND TECHNICAL CAPACITY OF WIRELESS NETWORKS IN RURAL AREAS.","POMPEU FABRA UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES (GERMANY), GERMANY","POMPEU FABRA UNIVERSITY,SPAIN","RAGOOBAR T, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.07.006; CLARKE R, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.11.006; BRIGLAUER W, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.05.003; HALLAHAN R, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2010.01.002; PERONARD J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.008; REGGI L, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.12.007; NUCCIARELLI A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.05.008; LIN M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.06.003; DAUVIN M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.05.006; BOURREAU M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.11.024; BELLOC F, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.11.023; BELTRÁN F, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.08.006; CAVE M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.04.012; BADASYAN N, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.09.004; HOLT L, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.03.005; GÖTZ G, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.03.001; GRUBESIC T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.11.017; PRIEGER J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.11.003; PUSCHITA E, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.08.001; OVANDO C, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.11.004; GRUBER H, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.06.007; WHITACRE B, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.05.005; TAHON M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.01.004; SCHNEIR J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2013.06.002; GERPOTT T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.11.007; KONGAUT C, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.06.003; GIJÓN C, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2015.11.003; GRZYBOWSKI L, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.02.002; RUHLE E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.001; FLACHER D, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.01.005; HALLER S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.003; ALLEMAN J, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2009.11.009; SCHNEIR J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.004; BROWN S, 2015, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2586016; OECD O, 2011, DOI 10.1787/5kg9sr5fmqwd-en",28,2016,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN GEOGRAPHY; HUMAN SOCIETY,PUB.1001729243,ISI,POMPEU FABRA UNIVERSITY;HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES (GERMANY),POMPEU FABRA UNIVERSITY,NA,"SCHNEIR JR, 2016, TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY","SCHNEIR JR, 2016, TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY",SPAIN; GERMANY,10.1016/j.telpol.2016.04.002,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1001729243,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

USING A TOPIC GUIDE, INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS UNDERWENT THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THE THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE OF “AGEING IN PLACE” (THE ABILITY TO STAY IN ONE’S OWN HOME IN LATER LIFE) WAS USED WHEN INTERPRETING THE FINDINGS.                                                           FINDINGS                     – PARTICIPANTS HAD BEEN MOTIVATED TO ATTEND THE CLASS INITIALLY TO GAIN COMPUTER SKILLS. INITIAL MOTIVATION WAS INFLUENCED BY THE DEATH OF A SPOUSE AND THE DESIRE TO REMAIN MENTALLY ACTIVE. THE MAIN OUTCOME BY THE CLASS WAS ACQUISITION OF COMPUTER SKILLS. PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS WERE ALSO REPORTED, THE LATTER CONSTITUTING MOTIVATION FOR CONTINUED ATTENDANCE. COMPUTER OWNERSHIP AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN PREFERRED TEACHING STYLE INFLUENCED CLASS OUTCOMES.

HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TABLET COMPUTER USE IN THE CLASSROOM. OUR STUDY EXAMINED STUDENTS’ LEARNING STYLES, ATTITUDES TOWARDS TABLET COMPUTER USE AND HOW THESE ARE LINKED TO THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. THE STUDY HAS INVESTIGATED 213 GRADE TWO STUDENTS IN ECONOMICALLY UNDERPRIVILEGED REGIONS OF NORTH THAILAND. DATA COLLECTION WAS BASED ON QUESTIONNAIRES FILLED IN BY THE STUDENTS WITH THE HELP OF THEIR TEACHERS. OUR RESULTS OVERALL SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE SOME KEY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN RELATION TO STUDENTS’ GENDER AND HOME LOCATIONS (URBAN VS. RURAL). IN CONTRAST TO EXISTING STUDIES, BOTH GENDERS AT THIS STAGE HAD SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCE AND POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS TABLET COMPUTER USE. HOWEVER, WE FOUND GIRLS HAD HIGHER VISUAL LEARNING STYLE (M =4.23, P <.032) THAN BOYS (M =3.96). WHERE HOME LOCATION WAS CONCERNED, RURAL STUDENTS HAD HIGHER LEARNING COMPETITIVENESS AND HIGHER LEVELS OF ANXIETY TOWARDS TABLET USE (M =1.71, P <.028) THAN URBAN STUDENTS (M =1.33).

THE ELDERLY MAKE UP ONE OF THE GROUPS MOST AFFECTED BY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, WITH LESS INTERNET ACCESS, KNOWLEDGE, AND USE. THE INTERNET IS BY DEFINITION AN ALMOST INFINITE STRUCTURE OF HYPERTEXT, WHERE THE USER NAVIGATES BY USING INFORMATION IN AN ACTIVE WAY, AND WHERE THE ELDERLY LACK PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH HYPERTEXTUAL APPLICATIONS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE NAVIGATION VARIABLE BY COMPARING TWO DESIGNS OF THE SAME EMAIL WEB APPLICATION WITH DIFFERENT NAVIGATION STYLES: LINEAR VS HYPERTEXTUAL NAVIGATION.THE STUDY CONSISTED OF USABILITY TESTING, EMPLOYING THE METHOD OF TASK ANALYSIS. OTHER ASSESSMENT TOOLS WERE ALSO USED, SUCH AS THE EYE TRACKER AND POST-SESSION SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES DESIGNED AD HOC FOR THIS STUDY.A SAMPLE OF 34 USERS FROM 60 TO 83 YEARS OLD AND WITH HETEROGENEOUS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. THEY PERFORMED A/B TESTING WITH A COUNTERBALANCED WITHIN-SUBJECT DESIGN. THE LINEAR NAVIGATION CONDITION, COMPARED TO THE HYPERTEXTUAL CONDITION, OBTAINED A HIGHER SUCCESS RATE, LOWER PERFORMANCE TIME, BETTER SATISFACTION RATINGS AND GREATER USER PREFERENCE.THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE RELEVANCE OF NAVIGATION IN SYSTEMS ORIENTED TOWARD THE ELDERLY, INDICATING THAT LINEAR NAVIGATION IS MORE SUITABLE FOR THESE USERS.","JAUME I UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, SPAIN;JAUME I UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, SPAIN;JAUME I UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;JAUME I UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE VALÈNCIA, SPAIN;JAUME I UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;JAUME I UNIVERSITY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, SPAIN","JAUME I UNIVERSITY,SPAIN","LIN D, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00045-6; NIELSEN J, 1994, DOI 10.1145/175276.175282; DOMMES A, 2010, DOI 10.1002/acp.1743; PORTER C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.06.003; CASTILLA D, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2012.10.017; BRAUN M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.004; MANDLER G, 1980, DOI 10.1037/0033-295x.87.3.252; GOMEZ L, 1986, DOI 10.1207/s15327051hci0201_1; SALMERON L, 2005, DOI 10.1207/s15326950dp4003_1; LEGRIS P, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00143-4; SAYAGO S, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.10.004; KARAHASANOVIĆ A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.08.012; ROBERTS P, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0953-5438(98)00068-x; DICKINSON A, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2005.09.003; COHEN J, 1988, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; CHADWICK-DIAS A, 2002, DOI 10.1145/960201.957212; KIM H, 1995, DOI 10.1080/01449299508914637; AL-GAHTANI S, 2001, DOI 10.4018/irmj.2001070104; GATTO S, 2008, DOI 10.1080/03601270802243697; AL-GAHTANI S, 2008, DOI 10.4018/irmj.2008100101; ETCHEMENDY E, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.07.022; CHADWICK-DIAS A, 2004, DOI 10.1145/985921.986072; MADRID R, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2008.06.005; GRAF P, 1984, DOI 10.1016/s0022-5371(84)90346-3; PRESCHL B, 2012, DOI 10.1080/13607863.2012.702726; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982; VENKATESH V, 2000, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.46.2.186.11926; SLOAN D, 2006, DOI 10.4017/gt.2006.05.02.007.00; VENKATESH V, 2000, DOI 10.2307/3250981; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540",43,2016,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1041734371,ISI,JAUME I UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA;JAUME I UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA;JAUME I UNIVERSITY;JAUME I UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE VALÈNCIA;JAUME I UNIVERSITY;JAUME I UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA,JAUME I UNIVERSITY,NA,"CASTILLA D, 2016, COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR","CASTILLA D, 2016, COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR",SPAIN; SPAIN; SPAIN,10.1016/j.chb.2015.10.034,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1041734371,NA,NA,NA,"MINISTERIO DE EDUCACIÓN CULTURA Y DEPORTE,ISCIII,MADRID,SPAIN;GENERALITAT VALENCIANA,ISCIII,VALENCIA,SPAIN;INSTITUTO DE SALUD CARLOS III,ISCIII,MADRID,SPAIN",DIM

THE BOOK WE INTRODUCE HERE (CRESS, MOSKALIUK, & JEONG, IN PRESS) DEALS WITH MASS COLLABORATION IN THE CONTEXT OF EDUCATION. THIS IS A NEW AND EMERGING RESEARCH FIELD THAT FIRST NEEDS SOME CLARIFICATION AND DEFINITIONS. IN THIS INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER, WE PROPOSE THAT MASS COLLABORATION IN EDUCATION IS CHARACTERIZED IN TERMS OF THE FOLLOWING FOUR ASPECTS: (1) FORMAL ASPECTS, SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF LEARNERS INVOLVED, THE TOOLS USED, AND THE CREATION OF ARTIFACTS; (2) INTERACTIVE ASPECTS SUCH AS PARTICIPATION, COORDINATION, COOPERATION, AND COLLABORATION; (3) ASPECTS REGARDING A CERTAIN SPIRIT EXHIBITED IN MASS COLLABORATION; AND (4) LEARNING-RELATED ASPECTS REGARDING WHERE THE LEARNING HAPPENS. THE BOOK’S OBJECTIVE IS TO PRESENT THE CURRENT STATE OF RESEARCH ON MASS COLLABORATION IN EDUCATION. WE ORGANIZED THE 18 CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DIFFERENT LABS AND RESEARCHERS INTO THREE PARTS. THE CHAPTERS IN THE FIRST PART INTRODUCE THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO MASS COLLABORATION. COGNITIVE APPROACHES AS WELL AS A SYSTEMIC AND A STIGMERGIC APPROACH ARE INCLUDED HERE. THE CHAPTERS IN THE SECOND PART PRESENT EMPIRICAL WORK THAT IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH SPECIFIC TOOLS OR ENVIRONMENTS FOR MASS COLLABORATION, FOR EXAMPLE, WIKIPEDIA, MOOCS (MASSIVE ONLINE OPEN COURSES), CITIZEN SCIENCE, E-PARTICIPATION, OR THE PLATFORM SCRATCH.

UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS RUSH TO PROMOTE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS WITHIN THIS TREND OF DIGITIZATION, LITTLE REGARDS IS GIVEN TO THE SECURITY OF SUCH WEB SITES. IN MANY CASES, GOVERNMENT HIGHLY CRITICAL WEB SITES ARE SIMPLY PRODUCED IN A PRODUCT LINE FASHION USING CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WHICH THE WEBMASTERS DO NOT QUITE MASTER.WE DISCUSS IN THIS STUDY OUR FINDINGS ON EMPIRICALLY ASSESSING THE SECURITY OF GOVERNMENT WEBSITES IN BURKINA FASO. BY SYSTEMATICALLY SCANNING THESE WEBSITES FOR SIMPLE AND WELL-KNOWN VULNERABILITIES, WE WERE ABLE TO DISCOVER ISSUES THAT DESERVED URGENT ATTENTION. AS AN EXAMPLE, WE WERE ABLE TO CRAWL FROM TEMPORARY BACKUP FILES IN A GOVERNMENT WEB SITE ALL INFORMATION (HOSTNAME, LOGIN AND PASSWORD IN CLEAR) TO READ AND WRITE DIRECTLY IN THE DATABASE AND FOR IMPERSONATING THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE WEBSITE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT AROUND 50 % OF THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITES ARE BUILT ON TOP OF PLATFORMS SUFFERING FROM 14 PUBLICLY KNOWN VULNERABILITIES, AND THUS CAN BE READILY ATTACKED BY ANY HACKER.","UNIVERSITY OF LUXEMBOURG, LUXEMBOURG;UNIVERSITY OF OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO;VTT TECHNICAL RESEARCH CENTRE OF FINLAND, FINLAND;UNIVERSITÉ VIRTUELLE DU TCHAD, N’DJAMENA, CHAD, CHAD;UNIVERSITY OF KOUDOUGOU, BURKINA FASO;UNIVERSITY OF OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO;UNIVERSITY OF KOUDOUGOU, BURKINA FASO;NAZI BONI UNIVERSITY, BURKINA FASO;NAZI BONI UNIVERSITY, BURKINA FASO;UNIVERSITY OF OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO","UNIVERSITY OF LUXEMBOURG,LUXEMBOURG","BISSYANDÉ T, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16886-9_27; TAN L, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s10664-013-9258-8; SHAHRIAR H, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2187671.2187673; BISSYANDÉ T, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10515-014-0152-4; BISSVANDÉ T, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2351676.2351686; CIAMPA A, 2010, DOI 10.1145/1809100.1809107; PALEARI R, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-70542-0_7; BISSYANDÉ T, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-08368-1_11; MOEN V, 2007, DOI 10.1504/ijesdf.2007.013595; BISSYANDÉ T, 2013, DOI 10.1109/compsac.2013.55",2,2016,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1010984531,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF LUXEMBOURG;UNIVERSITY OF OUAGADOUGOU;VTT TECHNICAL RESEARCH CENTRE OF FINLAND;UNIVERSITÉ VIRTUELLE DU TCHAD;UNIVERSITY OF KOUDOUGOU;UNIVERSITY OF OUAGADOUGOU;UNIVERSITY OF KOUDOUGOU;NAZI BONI UNIVERSITY;NAZI BONI UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF OUAGADOUGOU,UNIVERSITY OF LUXEMBOURG,NA,"BISSYANDÉ TF, 2016, NA","BISSYANDÉ TF, 2016, NA",LUXEMBOURG; BURKINA FASO; FINLAND; BURKINA FASO; BURKINA FASO,10.1007/978-3-319-43696-8_14,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1010984531,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

NUMEROUS ICT-BASED SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR ELDERLY CARE BUT MAINLY CONNECTED TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND NURSING ASPECTS IN SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY. SOCIAL WORK IS A PROFESSION THAT SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE COMPREHENSIVE WELLBEING AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF THE ELDERLY. MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION IN THEIR OLD AGE, EITHER AS A RESULT OF LIVING ALONE OR DUE TO A LACK OF CLOSE FAMILY TIES AND REDUCED CONNECTIONS WITH THEIR CULTURE OF ORIGIN, WHICH RESULTS IN AN INABILITY TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES (SINGH & MISRA, 2009). PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY WOULD ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE. WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE HAS RISEN DRAMATICALLY. THE AIM OF THIS LITERATURE REVIEW IS TO MAP OUT THE STATE OF THE ART OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE USAGE OF ICT IN ELDERLY CARE AND TO FIGURE OUT RESEARCH-BASED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE USABILITY OF ICT FOR THE PREVENTION OF LONELINESS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION OF ELDERLY PEOPLE. THE DATA FOR THE CURRENT RESEARCH COMES FROM THE CORE COLLECTION OF THE WEB OF SCIENCE AND THE DATA SEARCHING WAS PERFORMED USING BOOLEAN? THE SEARCHING RESULTED IN 216 PUBLISHED ENGLISH ARTICLES. AFTER GOING THROUGH THE TOPICS AND ABSTRACTS, 34 ARTICLES WERE SELECTED FOR THE DATA ANALYSIS THAT IS BASED ON A MULTI APPROACH FRAMEWORK. THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESEARCH APPROACH IS CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO SOME ASPECTS OF USING ICT BY OLDER ADULTS FROM THE ADOPTION OF ICT TO THE IMPACT OF USAGE, AND THE SOCIAL SERVICES FOR THEM. THIS LITERATURE REVIEW FOCUSED ON THE FUNCTION OF COMMUNICATION BY EXCLUDING THE APPLICATIONS THAT MAINLY RELATE TO PHYSICAL NURSING. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SO-CALLED ‘DIGITAL DIVIDE’ STILL EXISTS, BUT THE OLDER ADULTS HAVE THE WILLINGNESS TO LEARN AND UTILISE ICT IN DAILY LIFE, ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNICATION. THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE USAGE OF ICT CAN PREVENT THE LONELINESS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION OF OLDER ADULTS, AND THEY ARE EAGER FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN USING ICT. THE RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS ON THEORETICAL FRAMES AND CONCEPTS SHOW THAT THIS RESEARCH FIELD APPLIES DIFFERENT THEORETICAL FRAMES FROM VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC FIELDS, WHILE A SOCIAL WORK APPROACH IS LACKING. HOWEVER, A SYNERGIC FRAME OF APPLIED THEORIES WILL BE SUGGESTED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIAL WORK.","UNIVERSITY OF JYVÄSKYLÄ, FINLAND","UNIVERSITY OF JYVÄSKYLÄ,FINLAND","DOUKAS C, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2010.08.001; GUSTAFSON D, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s13063-015-0713-2; NIEHAVES B, 2014, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2013.19; HUNTER A, 2015, DOI 10.1111/glob.12091; SUM S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01437.x; JUNG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03601270903183313; FOKKEMA T, 2007, DOI 10.1080/13607860701366129; HOLDEN G, 1999, DOI 10.1177/104973159900900310; CRESCI M, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.gerinurse.2010.10.006; ROBERT P, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.irbm.2013.01.015; NÄSI M, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10433-011-0210-8; ORDONEZ T, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.archger.2010.11.007; PAN S, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.03.015; LIN C, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0741713610392760; PEACOCK S, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10433-007-0067-z; WU Y, 2015, DOI 10.2147/cia.s72399; HEART T, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2011.03.002; BEER J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2014.11.005; TSAI H, 2015, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2015.1048165; LEVY H, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s11606-014-3069-5; HILL R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.062; CHAUMON M, 2013, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2013.832382; NG T, 2011, DOI 10.1002/bem.20698; HALL A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1090198114547815; HIRVILAMMI T, 2014, DOI 10.3390/su6042160; LAM J, 2006, DOI 10.2753/mis0742-1222220407; BANDURA A, 1982, DOI 10.1037/0003-066x.37.2.122; SINGH A, 2009, DOI 10.4103/0972-6748.57861; CARMICHAEL A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.intcom.2007.06.001; CRESCI M, 2010, DOI 10.1097/ncn.0b013e3181cd8184; SOKOLER T, 2007, DOI 10.1080/01449290601173549; ALLAIRE J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2013.01.014; O’MARA B, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0017896911407054; BLASCHKE C, 2009, DOI 10.1093/bjsw/bcp025; YAMADA K, 2015, DOI 10.1093/geronb/gbv059; PARKER-OLIVER D, 2006, DOI 10.1093/sw/51.2.127; REAMER F, 2013, DOI 10.1093/sw/swt003; DE SCHUTTER B, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1555412010364978; HOBFOLL S, 1986, DOI 10.1521/jscp.1986.4.2.189; CHOI N, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2645; PRADO S, 2012, DOI 10.3916/c39-2012-03-10",8,2016,HEALTH SERVICES AND SYSTEMS; HEALTH SCIENCES; HUMAN SOCIETY; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; SOCIAL WORK,PUB.1004158332,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF JYVÄSKYLÄ,UNIVERSITY OF JYVÄSKYLÄ,NA,"FAN Q, 2016, CUADERNOS DE TRABAJO SOCIAL","FAN Q, 2016, CUADERNOS DE TRABAJO SOCIAL",FINLAND,10.5209/cuts.51771,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1004158332,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

INEQUALITY IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY. SAGE, THOUSAND OAKS, 2005) DISCUSSES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND HOW IT HAS CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. IT STARTED WITH A DEFICIT IN ACCESSING TECHNOLOGY IN THE 1990S AND EARLY 2000, BUT HAS NOW EVOLVED INTO A GAP BETWEEN THE SKILLS DEMAND AND SUPPLY. A CLOSER LOOK SHOWS THAT THE DIVIDE IS ACTUALLY NOT A SIMPLE DIVIDE, BUT A RATHER COMPLEX DIGITAL ISSUE COMPRISING SEVERAL GAPS. THE NEED FOR IT PROFESSIONALS IS OUTSTANDING AND MORE AND MORE SEEN AS A HUGE DISADVANTAGE FOR SMES. WHILE THE NEED OF IT SKILLS ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND EMPLOYEE LEVEL IS QUITE WELL EXAMINED, ONLY FEW STUDIES CAN BE FOUND FOR THE ORGANISATIONAL LEVEL. THE ORGANISATIONAL LEVEL IS DIFFERENT AND COMPRISES THE CORE COMPETENCIES OF AN ENTERPRISE OR ORGANISATION. IN THE CASE OF IT, THE RELEVANT LITERATURE SPEAKS OF IT CAPABILITIES. THE LITERATURE IN THIS AREA SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN GATHERED OR ANALYSED AS A WHOLE REGARDING IT CAPABILITIES OF SMES. AS THE IT REPRESENTS THE BACKBONE OF MODERN ORGANISATIONS, THE GOAL OF THIS CONTRIBUTION WILL BE A SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY EXISTING IT CAPABILITY FRAMEWORKS AND RELEVANT TOPICS. THE FINDINGS WILL BE INTEGRATED IN A HOLISTIC MODEL AND SPECIFIC ACTION FIELDS FOR SMES DERIVED.","UNIVERSITY OF PASSAU, GERMANY;UNIVERSITY OF PASSAU, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF PASSAU,GERMANY","CALDEIRA M, 2003, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000454; SOUTHERN A, 2000, DOI 10.1111/1468-005x.00070; WIELICKI T, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0165551509354417; MATTHEWS P, 2007, DOI 10.1002/jid.1401; AL-HAKIM L, 2009, DOI 10.4018/978-1-60566-024-0.ch002; DIBRELL C, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-627x.2008.00240.x; BERNAERT M, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-38244-4_4; SCHOLARIOS D, 2008, DOI 10.1080/09585190802051337; ZAMBARLOUKOS S, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1468-2419.00162; KOGUT B, 1992, DOI 10.1287/orsc.3.3.383; NELSON R, 1982, DOI 10.2307/1885872; VIERU D, 2015, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2015.557; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812",3,2017,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1091999271,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF PASSAU;UNIVERSITY OF PASSAU,UNIVERSITY OF PASSAU,NA,"LEHNER F, 2017, NA","LEHNER F, 2017, NA",GERMANY,10.1007/978-3-319-63257-5_9,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1091999271,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE ARTICLE REPORTS FROM A SURVEY ON USABILITY EVALUATION AND UCD PRACTICES IN ETHIOPIAN SOFTWARE ORGANIZATIONS. IT AIMS AT EXPLORING THE PRACTICE OF USABILITY EVALUATION, USER INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION IN THE SOFTWARE ORGANIZATIONS IN ETHIOPIA. SOME PART OF THE SURVEY QUESTION IS ADAPTED FROM A PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED SURVEY IN ITALY AND DENMARK AND FURTHER EXPANDED WITH A SET OF QUESTIONS REFERRING TO USER INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION. THE SURVEY WAS TRIANGULATED WITH INTERVIEWS WITH A SUBSET OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF ORGANIZATIONS PERFORMING SOME FORM OF USABILITY EVALUATION IS LOW IN ETHIOPIA. THE CHALLENGES OF USABILITY EVALUATION OBSERVED IN THE STUDY WAS ANALYZED WITH RESPECT TO THE CHALLENGES OF ‘DIGITAL DIVIDE’ AGAINST THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE METHODS AND PRACTICES AND AMONG DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING NATIONS USING REAL ACCESS/REAL IMPACT CRITERIA. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES OF USABILITY NOT DISCUSSED IN THE LITERATURE REVIEWED IN ANY DETAIL SUCH AS LESS IT SKILLS, LACK OF TRAINED PROFESSIONALS, AND LACK OF AWARENESS. THE RESULT FOR USER INVOLVEMENT SHOWS ALSO SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES: LACK OF USER MOTIVATION, ACCEPTANCE OF CHANGE AND CULTURAL INFLUENCE. HOWEVER, MORE THAN 80% OF THE SURVEYED ORGANIZATIONS CLAIM INVOLVING USERS IN SOME KIND IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE NEED TO CONTEXTUALIZE UCD AND USABILITY METHODS ARE DISCUSSED.","ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY, ETHIOPIA;IT UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, DENMARK;ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY, ETHIOPIA;UNIVERSITY OF BARI ALDO MORO, ITALY;UNIVERSITY OF BARI ALDO MORO, ITALY","ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY,ETHIOPIA","NIELSEN J, 1993, DOI 10.1016/b978-0-08-052029-2.50007-3; FITZGERALD B, 1998, DOI 10.1016/s0378-7206(98)00072-x; WHITWORTH B, 2009, DOI 10.4018/978-1-60566-264-0.ch046; ROOKSBY J, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s10606-009-9098-7; OYUGI C, 2008, DOI 10.1145/1463160.1463195; LANZILOTTI R, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2010.07.005; BANO M, 2013, DOI 10.1145/2460999.2461017; KUJALA S, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01449290301782; TEKA D, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2897586.2897604; DAMODARAN L, 1996, DOI 10.1080/014492996120049; ARDITO C, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2013.10.004; BAK J, 2008, DOI 10.1145/1463160.1463164; ABELEIN U, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s10664-013-9278-4; NOYES J, 1996, DOI 10.1080/014492996120274; WALSHAM G, 2002, DOI 10.2307/4132313",7,2017,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING; INFORMATION SYSTEMS,PUB.1099603492,ISI,ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY;IT UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN;ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF BARI ALDO MORO;UNIVERSITY OF BARI ALDO MORO,ADDIS ABABA UNIVERSITY,NA,"TEKA D, 2017, THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES","TEKA D, 2017, THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES",ETHIOPIA; DENMARK; ITALY,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2017.tb00616.x,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1099603492,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

YET, THE NOTION OF THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT INEQUITIES IN TERMS OF WHO ACCESSES AND BENEFITS FROM THE DIGITAL LANDSCAPE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, A REALIST SYNTHESIS WAS CONDUCTED TO INFORM THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS); TO UNDERSTAND THE PRACTICALITIES OF ACCESS AND USE INEQUITIES; TO UNCOVER PRACTICES THAT FACILITATE DIGITAL LITERACY AND PARTICIPATION; AND TO RECOMMEND POLICIES TO MITIGATE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH YIELDED 55 ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2006 AND 2016. SYNTHESIS OF EXISTING KNOWLEDGE, COMBINED WITH USER-EXPERIENCE ELICITED THROUGH A DELIBERATIVE DIALOGUE SESSION WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS (N = 35), MADE VISIBLE A PATTERN OF PRIVILEGE THAT DETERMINED INDIVIDUAL AGENCY IN ICT ACCESS AND USE. RESULTS: THOUGH AGE IS CONSISTENTLY CENTRALIZED AS THE KEY DETERMINANT OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, OUR ANALYSES, WHICH ENCOMPASSED BOTH VAN DIJK'S RESOURCES AND APPROPRIATION THEORY AND INTERSECTIONALITY, APPRAISED THIS NOTION AND REVEALED THAT AGE IS NOT THE SOLE DETERMINANT.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: INFORMED BY RESULTS OF A REALIST SYNTHESIS THAT WAS GUIDED BY INTERSECTIONAL PERSPECTIVES, A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WAS DEVELOPED OUTLINING IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY, POLICY, AND PRACTICE TO ADDRESS THE WICKED PROBLEM THAT IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.","SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY, CANADA;HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE-FOOD CANADA, CANADA;SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY, CANADA;UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE, UNITED KINGDOM;HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY,CANADA","FRIEMEL T, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; LEE J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.860182; RYCROFT-MALONE J, 2012, DOI 10.1186/1748-5908-7-33; YU R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109695; LARSSON E, 2013, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2012.699833; ECHT K, 2011, DOI 10.3109/02703181.2010.547657; NIEHAVES B, 2014, DOI 10.1057/ejis.2013.19; QUAN-HAASE A, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1140217; WONG Y, 2009, DOI 10.1080/15228830802459135; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; JUNG Y, 2010, DOI 10.1080/03601270903183313; VAN DEURSEN A, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; LAM J, 2007, DOI 10.1300/j017v25n01_11; MCCORMACK B, 2007, DOI 10.1002/pdh.210; LARSON E, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.pbb.2005.07.015; PAWSON R, 2005, DOI 10.1258/1355819054308530; ATKINSON J, 2008, DOI 10.1080/00049180802419203; DENIZARD-THOMPSON N, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10900-010-9327-5; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.001; WU Y, 2015, DOI 10.2147/cia.s72399; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; WRIGHT D, 2009, DOI 10.1080/08959420902732514; ABBEY R, 2009, DOI 10.1108/14779960911004480; TSAI H, 2015, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2015.1048165; TONG A, 2007, DOI 10.1093/intqhc/mzm042; ALLEN B, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00063-6; HILL R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.062; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; GREENHALGH T, 2011, DOI 10.1186/1471-2288-11-115; GRAHAM R, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809341436; LISSITSA S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2015.06.002; IHM J, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1019912; KANIA-LUNDHOLM M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2015.07.008; DAMODARAN L, 2013, DOI 10.1159/000357431; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1111401; HALL A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1090198114547815; LIM C, 2009, DOI 10.1080/09544820903317001; LAM J, 2006, DOI 10.2753/mis0742-1222220407; SIXSMITH A, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-8348-0; CHANG J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/01634372.2014.913754; BOGER J, 2016, DOI 10.3109/17483107.2016.1151953; HANCOCK A, 2007, DOI 10.1017/s1537592707070065; CHOPIK W, 2016, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2016.0151; GAZIBARA T, 2015, DOI 10.1093/heapro/dau106; CHOUDRIE J, 2013, DOI 10.1093/iwc/iws020; HASHIZUME A, 2012, DOI 10.11591/ij-ict.v2i1.1506; YU L, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0165551511426246; OMOTAYO F, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0961000616662517; DEL PRETE A, 2011, DOI 10.1177/097185241101500107; DUNCAN G, 2002, DOI 10.2105/ajph.92.7.1151; CHOI N, 2013, DOI 10.2196/jmir.2645; WRIGHT E, 1977, DOI 10.2307/2117730; CHU A, 2009, DOI 10.3163/1536-5050.97.1.003; CASADO-MUÑOZ R, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-04; COLOMBO F, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-05; PERAL-PERAL B, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-06; BOUMA H, 2007, DOI 10.4017/gt.2007.06.04.003.00; GAN X, 2016, DOI 10.4017/gt.2016.14.4.007.00; KISER A, 2015, DOI 10.4018/ijdldc.2015040103; GOODALL K, 2010; RIVA G, 2014; FISK M, 2003, DOI 10.2307/j.ctt1t8951n; CRENSHAW K, 1991, DOI 10.2307/1229039; WALSTER E, 1975, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-4560.1975.tb00001.x",124,2018,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1101875708,ISI,SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY;HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY;AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE-FOOD CANADA;SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE;HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY;HERIOT-WATT UNIVERSITY,SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY,NA,"FANG ML, 2018, THE GERONTOLOGIST","FANG ML, 2018, THE GERONTOLOGIST",CANADA; UNITED KINGDOM; CANADA; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1093/geront/gny037,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1101875708,NA,NA,NA,"SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL,SSHRC,OTTAWA,CANADA",DIM

WHILE THE WEB WAS ENVISIONED AS AN EQUALIZING FORCE THAT ALLOWS EVERYONE TO ACCESS INFORMATION, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE PREVENTS LARGE AMOUNTS OF PEOPLE FROM BEING PRESENT ONLINE. ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA, IN PARTICULAR, ARE PRONE TO GENDER INEQUALITY, AN IMPORTANT ISSUE GIVEN THE LINK BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND EMPLOYMENT. UNDERSTANDING GENDER INEQUALITY IN SOCIAL MEDIA IS A CHALLENGING TASK DUE TO THE NECESSITY OF DATA SOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE LARGE-SCALE MEASUREMENTS ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES. HERE, WE SHOW HOW THE FACEBOOK GENDER DIVIDE (FGD), A METRIC BASED ON AGGREGATED STATISTICS OF MORE THAN 1.4 BILLION USERS IN 217 COUNTRIES, EXPLAINS VARIOUS ASPECTS OF WORLDWIDE GENDER INEQUALITY. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE FGD ENCODES GENDER EQUALITY INDICES IN EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. WE FIND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN NETWORK EXTERNALITIES THAT SUGGEST THAT USING SOCIAL MEDIA HAS AN ADDED VALUE FOR WOMEN. FURTHERMORE, WE FIND THAT LOW VALUES OF THE FGD ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN ECONOMIC GENDER EQUALITY. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS, WHILE SUFFERING EVIDENT GENDER IMBALANCE, MAY LOWER THE BARRIERS THAT WOMEN HAVE TO ACCESS TO INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES AND HELP TO NARROW THE ECONOMIC GENDER GAP.","COMPLEXITY SCIENCE HUB VIENNA, AUSTRIA;MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA, AUSTRIA;IMDEA NETWORKS, SPAIN;CARLOS III UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;CARLOS III UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;DATA61, AUSTRALIA;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNITED STATES;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNITED STATES;SPAIN;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNITED STATES;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNITED STATES;CARLOS III UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN","DATA61,AUSTRALIA","MAGNO G, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-13734-6_9; BURKE M, 2013, DOI 10.1145/2441776.2441936; RIZOIU M, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2835776.2835798; HENDLER J, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.websem.2007.11.008; METCALF J, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2053951716650211; SPAISER V, 2014, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0097856; KOLLER M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.csda.2011.02.014; BERNERS-LEE T, 2010, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican1210-80; WAGNER C, 2016, DOI 10.1140/epjds/s13688-016-0066-4; GEE L, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jebo.2016.12.004; JENSEN R, 2007, DOI 10.1162/qjec.122.3.879; PÖTZSCHKE S, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0894439316666262; CABAÑAS J, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3025453.3025903; GARCIA D, 2017, DOI 10.1126/sciadv.1701172; ZAGHENI E, 2017, DOI 10.1111/padr.12102; ARAUJO M, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3091478.3091513; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; FRIEDERICI N, 2017, DOI 10.1002/j.1681-4835.2017.tb00578.x; GARCIA D, 2018, DOI 10.1140/epjds/s13688-018-0130-3; FATEHKIA M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.03.007; DUBOIS A, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-01159-8_5; BILLARI F, 2017, DOI 10.31235/osf.io/f9vzp; COMPAINE B, 2001, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001",40,2018,"COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA STUDIES; HUMAN SOCIETY; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE; GENDER STUDIES",PUB.1104995317,ISI,COMPLEXITY SCIENCE HUB VIENNA;MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA;CARLOS III UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;CARLOS III UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;CARLOS III UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,NOTREPORTED,NA,"GARCIA D, 2018, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","GARCIA D, 2018, PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",AUSTRIA; AUSTRIA; SPAIN; SPAIN; AUSTRALIA; USA,10.1073/pnas.1717781115,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1104995317,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM;MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS,MINECO,MADRID,SPAIN;PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS,PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS,PHILADELPHIA,UNITED STATES;VIENNA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FUND,WWTF,VIENNA,AUSTRIA",DIM

THIS TECHNOLOGY COULD INCLUDE TELEPHONES, TELEVISION, COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET. THE ARRIVAL OF HIGH-SPEED INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO THE KINGDOM OF TONGA CONTINUES TO BRING OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS BUSINESS GROWTH AND JOBS CREATION; HOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO A GROWING DIGITAL DIVIDE AFFECTING THE COUNTRY AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THESE MOTIVATE US TO DEBATE AND SEEK THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE THE DIVIDE IN TONGA. MUCH OF THE RESEARCH ON THIS AREA FOCUSES ON THE ACCESSIBILITY TO THE TECHNOLOGIES, WHILE SOME WORKS HAVE ADDRESSED THE INEQUALITY IN THE ABILITY AND SKILLS TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY. MOTIVATED BY THE UNITED NATIONS' SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS), ESPECIALLY GOAL 9 ON INDUSTRY, INNOVATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND GOAL 10 ON REDUCED INEQUALITIES, WE EXAMINE BOTH PERSPECTIVES OF DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TONGA. MOREOVER, WE INTRODUCE THE MOST RECENT BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES AND DISCUSS THEIR POTENTIAL TO ENABLE TONGA'S DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF RELIABILITY, SECURITY AND AFFORDABILITY. WE THEN ENVISION A SUSTAINABLE MULTI-TENANCY BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE TO INTEGRATE VARIOUS ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES IN ORDER TO OFFER MULTI-SERVICES, WHICH CAN BEST ACCOMMODATE TONGAN'S VARIOUS ICT NEEDS ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS.

ONE OF THE MOST OUTSTANDING GLOBAL PROBLEMS FACING AFRICA IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. HOWEVER, THE USE AND ADOPTION OF MOBILE PHONES IS REDUCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN AFRICA. IN VIEW OF THE ROLE THAT MOBILE PHONES PLAY IN BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN AFRICA, THIS STUDY EXTENDS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL (TAM), WITHOUT ALTERING ITS PARSIMONY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOCUS, IN MOBILE PHONE ADOPTION. THIS PAPER EXTENDS THE TAM MODEL BY ADDING TWO NEW CONSTRUCTS, PERCEIVED ADVANTAGE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE EXTENDED TAM WAS APPLIED TO ADOPTION OF MOBILE PHONES IN FARMING COMMUNITIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. THE STUDY RELIES ON A SAMPLE FROM 300 DAIRY FARMERS IN UGANDA WHICH WAS ANALYSED USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING. THEORETICALLY, IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE LIMITED LITERATURE ON MOBILE PHONE ADOPTION IN AGRI-FOOD SECTOR IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA AND PROVIDES EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FROM UGANDAN FARMERS. THE RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO PROMOTING MOBILE PHONE USAGE IN FARMING COMMUNITIES BEYOND JUST NORMAL COMMUNICATION. THE RESEARCH ALSO HAS A STRONG PRACTICAL IMPLICATION FOR FARMERS AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR.","GHENT UNIVERSITY, BELGIUM;MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON UNIVERSITY, UGANDA;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM;MAKERERE UNIVERSITY, UGANDA;GHENT UNIVERSITY, BELGIUM","BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON,UNITED KINGDOM","KIM D, 2008, DOI 10.1002/jtr.669; BAYARD B, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2006.07.004; KASSIE M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.08.016; AMANKWAH-AMOAH J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2016.01.026; CROPPENSTEDT A, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1467-9361.00175; DOSS C, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1574-0864.2006.00119.x; MATHIESON K, 2001, DOI 10.1145/506724.506730; PAI F, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2010.11.007; JAMES J, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s11205-006-9079-x; JAMES J, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2009.01.004; OVERÅ R, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.11.015; LIU I, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.009; WYCHE S, 2015, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2015.1048184; GURTNER S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2014.06.020; NIKOU S, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2012.09.007; OSABUTEY E, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2016.04.143; NDIRITU S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.foodpol.2014.06.010; JAIN L, 2014, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2013.874325; COSTANTINI V, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2014.06.014; LUARN P, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.003; KIBERE F, 2016, DOI 10.1080/02681102.2016.1155144; KASSIE M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2012.08.007; SHIMAMOTO D, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.foodpol.2015.10.005; CONCI M, 2009, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-03655-2_7; CHAVULA H, 2014, DOI 10.5897/jdae2013.0517; AMANKWAH‐AMOAH J, 2014, DOI 10.1002/tie.21677; WU J, 2005, DOI 10.1016/j.im.2004.07.001; DEICHMANN U, 2016, DOI 10.1111/agec.12300; JAMES J, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2008.09.002; GOGGIN G, 2009, DOI 10.1080/09614520902866371; GALANG R, 2012, DOI 10.1057/jibs.2012.20; ASONGU S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.05.012; ALBIMAN M, 2016, DOI 10.1108/jstpm-06-2016-0010; KHONJE M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.09.008; AKER J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.foodpol.2015.03.006; WANG Q, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.10.024; PARK E, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s11277-013-1266-x; FISHER M, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10584-015-1459-2; TADESSE G, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.12.010; MUTO M, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.05.004; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; FISHER M, 2014, DOI 10.1017/s0014479714000027; RAYKOV T, 1997, DOI 10.1177/01466216970212006; FEDER G, 1985, DOI 10.1086/451461; AKER J, 2014, DOI 10.1093/wber/lhu006; AKER J, 2010, DOI 10.1257/jep.24.3.207; NABHANI I, 2016, DOI 10.7160/aol.2016.080209; ASONGU S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2017.01.026; OUMA S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.rdf.2017.01.001; SEKABIRA H, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.foodpol.2017.10.004; ABRAHAM R, 2005, DOI 10.1109/ictd.2006.301837; MALHOTRA Y, 1999, DOI 10.1109/hicss.1999.772658; BATCHELOR S, 2014, DOI 10.2991/ict4s-14.2014.33; LABONNE J, 2009, DOI 10.1596/1813-9450-4996",49,2018,"BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1099722261,ISI,GHENT UNIVERSITY;MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON UNIVERSITY;BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON;UNIVERSITY OF THE WEST OF ENGLAND;MAKERERE UNIVERSITY;GHENT UNIVERSITY,BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON,NA,"KABBIRI R, 2018, TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE","KABBIRI R, 2018, TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE",BELGIUM; UGANDA; UNITED KINGDOM; UNITED KINGDOM; UGANDA,10.1016/j.techfore.2017.12.010,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1099722261,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES CAN TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS BROUGHT BY THE NEW SYSTEMS TO EVERYDAY LIFE, BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, IF SERVICES ARE NOT CAREFULLY DESIGNED, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO AUGMENT THE DIGITAL GAP BETWEEN “INFO-SKILLED” USERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PAPER PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF INTERESTING PROJECTS DEVELOPED WITH THE AIM TO FAVOR SOCIAL INCLUSION AND TO TEAR DOWN BARRIERS POSED BY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, BY SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS (E.G., ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IMPAIRMENTS) IN THE FRUITION OF E-SERVICES THROUGH EASY FORMS OF INTERACTIONS. THE STUDY IS RESTRICTED TO SOLUTIONS THAT ENVISAGE THE TV DEVICE AS THE MAIN USER INTERFACE FOR SUPPORTING AMBIENT ASSISTED LIVING. FROM THE SURVEY, A BASIC SET OF SERVICES AND INTERFACES, HERE DESCRIBED, APPEAR TO BE FUNDAMENTAL FOR IMPROVING DIGITAL AND SOCIAL INCLUSION, BUT THE DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING TV-BASED INTERFACES AND SERVICES MUST BE CAREFULLY CHOSEN TO REDUCE SOCIAL MARGINALIZATION.","UNIVERSITY OF SIENA, ITALY;UNIVERSITY OF SIENA, ITALY","UNIVERSITY OF SIENA,ITALY","BITTENCOURT I, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10209-015-0422-3; MOUMTZI V, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1579114.1579170; RAFFAELI L, 2016, DOI 10.4018/ijehmc.2016010103; NEWELL A, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10209-010-0203-y; DEWSBURY G, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s10209-007-0079-7; NUNES F, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2384916.2384924; MARTINS M, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s10209-013-0329-9; WINKLEY J, 2012, DOI 10.1109/tce.2012.6227435; SANTANA-MANCILLA P, 2017, DOI 10.3390/ijerph14060617; DEMIR E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2017.08.302; WILLS C, 2010, DOI 10.1109/dest.2010.5610654; SHIRALI-SHAHREZA M, 2006, DOI 10.1109/canet.2006.279275; PEREIRA R, 2011, DOI 10.1109/i-society18435.2011.5978455",1,2018,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1104412307,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF SIENA;UNIVERSITY OF SIENA,UNIVERSITY OF SIENA,NA,"ANDREADIS A, 2018, NA","ANDREADIS A, 2018, NA",ITALY,10.1007/978-3-319-92052-8_15,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1104412307,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

FULFILLING SUCH A MISSION WILL REQUIRE SATELLITE SERVICES ON PAR WITH FIBRE SERVICES, BOTH IN BANDWIDTH AND COST. ACHIEVING SUCH A PERFORMANCE REQUIRES A NEW GENERATION OF COMMUNICATIONS PAYLOADS POWERED BY LARGE-SCALE PROCESSORS, ENABLING A DYNAMIC ALLOCATION OF HUNDREDS OF BEAMS WITH A TOTAL CAPACITY BEYOND 1 TBIT S−1. THE FACT THAT THE SCALE OF THE PROCESSOR IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE WAVELENGTH OF ITS SIGNALS HAS MADE PHOTONICS A KEY TECHNOLOGY FOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION. HOWEVER, ONE LAST CHALLENGE HINDERS THE INTRODUCTION OF PHOTONICS: WHILE LARGE-SCALE PROCESSORS DEMAND A MODULAR IMPLEMENTATION, COHERENCY AMONG SIGNALS MUST BE PRESERVED USING SIMPLE METHODS. HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE A COHERENT PHOTONIC-AIDED RECEIVER MEETING SUCH DEMANDS.

THE ARTICLE COMBINES A MULTILEVEL MODEL OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITH THE CONCEPT OF BUSINESS IDEA AND ANALYZES THE FUTURE SCENARIOS OF LITHUANIAN PUBLIC LIBRARIES. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES' IMPORTANCE IN CONDUCTING TRAINING, CONSULTANCY, AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING TO STIMULATE DIGITAL INCLUSION. POTENTIALLY, LIBRARIES CAN MOTIVATE USERS TO ADOPT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, BUT THIS ROLE IS STILL NOT SUFFICIENTLY VISIBLE. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT LIBRARIES FACE CHALLENGES OF REDEFINING THEIR SOCIAL VALUE AND OBTAINING THE SUSTAINING FUNDS, SKILLS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY FOR DIGITAL INCLUSION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, THEY CAN USE COLLABORATION NETWORKS, EFFECTIVE COST MANAGEMENT, AND EXTERNAL EXPERTISE TO OVERCOME THESE OBSTACLES.","VILNIUS UNIVERSITY, LITHUANIA;VILNIUS UNIVERSITY, LITHUANIA","VILNIUS UNIVERSITY,LITHUANIA","HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; BISHOP P, 2007, DOI 10.1108/14636680710727516; BERTOT J, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2910019.2910082; KINNEY B, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01616841003779718; YILMAZ B, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0340035215608861; O’HEHIR E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/00049670.2015.1087298; WRIGHT G, 2011, DOI 10.1057/9780230306899; SIN S, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.lisr.2010.06.002; GOULD E, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0266666910367739; JAEGER P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2012.654728; CHERMACK T, 2004, DOI 10.1016/s0016-3287(03)00156-3; WRIGHT A, 2005, DOI 10.1108/00251740510572506; COHRON M, 2015, DOI 10.1080/0361526x.2015.1036195; TSATSOU P, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0163443710393865; VAN DER HEIJDEN K, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10878570110396103; CRAVEN J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/b978-1-84334-131-4.50007-8; JACKSON K, 2002, DOI 10.1177/109442802237114; TAYLOR N, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2012.707106; REAL B, 2014, DOI 10.6017/ital.v33i1.5141; WAYLAND R, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2017.09.005; PICK J, 2016, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2016.484; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812",4,2019,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1123261776,ISI,VILNIUS UNIVERSITY;VILNIUS UNIVERSITY,VILNIUS UNIVERSITY,NA,"MANŽUCH Z, 2019, JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","MANŽUCH Z, 2019, JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY",LITHUANIA,10.1002/asi.24324,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1123261776,NA,NA,NA,"LIETUVOS MOKSLO TARYBA,EC,VILNIUS,LITHUANIA;EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

DUE TO THE INCREASING DIGITIZATION WHICH IS TAKING PLACE ALL OVER THE WORLD, IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF PEOPLE’S DIGITAL COMPETENCES AND CLOSE THE “DIGITAL GAP” THAT CAUSES MULTIPLE DISADVANTAGES FOR CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE. IN MARCH 2018, ELEVEN STUDENTS OF REHABILITATION SCIENCE AT UNIVERSITY OF DORTMUND (GERMANY) CONDUCTED FIVE DIFFERENT COURSES FOR DISADVANTAGED PERSONS IN DORTMUND. THE COURSES LASTED AROUND TWO HOURS AND AIMED AT RAISING AWARENESS FOR THE POTENTIALS AND PITFALLS OF DIGITAL TOOLS USED IN THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT TARGET GROUPS. IN TOTAL, 417 PEOPLE ATTENDED THESE COURSES, MOSTLY 6 TO 10 PARTICIPANTS PER COURSE. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE BEST PRACTICES IN DESIGNING, DEVELOPING, CONDUCTING AND EVALUATING THESE COURSES. AN EXTENSIVE SURVEY (338 PARTICIPANTS) IS USED TO ANALYZE SUCCESSFUL MEANS IN DELIVERING COURSES ON IT TOPICS TO DIVERSE TARGET GROUPS. THE STUDENT ACTIVITIES WERE LINKED TO THE “ALL DIGITAL WEEK”, A PAN-EUROPEAN CAMPAIGN THAT ORGANIZES COURSES IN 25 COUNTRIES WITH MORE THAN 92,460 PARTICIPANTS. THE “GET ONLINE WEEK” DORTMUND 2018, WHICH IS PART OF THE EUROPEAN “ALL DIGITAL” CAMPAIGN AND CARRIED OUT IN GERMANY, IS LISTED AS AN EXAMPLE IN THIS ARTICLE, TO SHOW HOW A PROJECT TO RAISE DIGITAL COMPETENCES CAN BE DESIGNED AND WHAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION.

I PROPOSE THAT DIGITAL INEQUALITIES RESEARCH SHOULD LOOK MORE INTO LABOR‐ AND BIG DATA‐RELATED QUESTIONS SUCH AS INEQUALITIES IN ONLINE LABOR MARKETS AND THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ALGORITHMIC DECISION‐MAKING FOR VULNERABLE POPULATION GROUPS. THE ARTICLE ENGAGES WITH THE SOCIOLOGICAL LITERATURE ON DIGITAL INEQUALITIES AND EXPLAINS THE GENERAL APPROACH TO DIGITAL INEQUALITIES, BASED ON THE DISTINCTION OF FIRST‐, SECOND‐, AND THIRD‐LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDES. FIRST, INEQUALITIES IN ACCESS TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE DISCUSSED. THIS DISCUSSION IS EXTENDED TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET‐OF‐THINGS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE‐POWERED SYSTEMS SUCH AS SMART SPEAKERS. SECOND, INEQUALITIES IN DIGITAL SKILLS AND TECHNOLOGY USE ARE REVIEWED AND CONNECTED TO THE DISCOURSE ON NEW FORMS OF WORK SUCH AS THE SHARING ECONOMY OR GIG ECONOMY. THIRD AND FINALLY, THE DISCOURSE ON THE OUTCOMES, IN THE FORM OF BENEFITS OR HARMS, FROM DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY USE IS TAKEN UP. HERE, I PROPOSE TO INTEGRATE THE DIGITAL INEQUALITIES LITERATURE MORE STRONGLY WITH CRITICAL ALGORITHM STUDIES AND RECENT DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DATAFICATION, DIGITAL FOOTPRINTS, AND INFORMATION PRIVACY.","BI NORWEGIAN BUSINESS SCHOOL, NORWAY","BI NORWEGIAN BUSINESS SCHOOL,NORWAY","LUTZ C, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2056305115626749; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; HUMPHREYS L, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12019; PEARCE K, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12045; NAPOLI P, 2014, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2014.944726; HARGITTAI E, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00396.x; HOFFMANN C, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.991343; HARGITTAI E, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0002716215570866; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; SCHRADIE J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003; VAN DEURSEN A, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; LEWIS S, 2013, DOI 10.1080/08838151.2012.761702; ESLAMI M, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2702123.2702556; PRZYBYLSKI A, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0265407512453827; GITAU S, 2010, DOI 10.1145/1753326.1753720; ROBINSON L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1012532; ZUBOFF S, 2015, DOI 10.1057/jit.2015.5; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x; RADER E, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2702123.2702174; BUCHER T, 2016, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1154086; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; ROBINSON L, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180902857678; ISOMURSU P, 2007, DOI 10.1007/s12130-007-9033-5; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; GUI M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/1461444810389751; BLANK G, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.777758; KITTUR A, 2013, DOI 10.1145/2441776.2441923; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0093650208321782; LIGHT B, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444816675438; BLANK G, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444816667135; BRAKE D, 2013, DOI 10.1111/jcc4.12042; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; KVASNY L, 2006, DOI 10.1080/13691180600630740; SIMS C, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.808363; SCHOR J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2015.11.001; HALFORD S, 2010, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2010.499956; CORREA T, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2010.01532.x; HARGITTAI E, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13691180801946150; TICHENOR P, 1970, DOI 10.1086/267786; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; LUTZ C, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1293129; IGNATOW G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1301519; TSETSI E, 2017, DOI 10.1177/2050157917708329; BLANK G, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0002764217717559; VAN DEURSEN A, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444817715282; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; GEIGER R, 2017, DOI 10.1177/2053951717730735; ANDREOTTI A, 2017, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3046550; DUFFY B, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3097286.3097291; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; ROSENBLAT A, 2015, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2686227; MARLER W, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818765154; WOOD A, 2018, DOI 10.1111/ntwe.12112; WOOD A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0950017018785616; NEWLANDS G, 2018, DOI 10.1111/ntwe.12119; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818797082; MICHELI M, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jices-02-2018-0014; NEWLANDS G, 2018, DOI 10.5210/fm.v23i11.8159; VAN DER ZEEUW A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818821067; ORBEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1038/s41562-018-0506-1; NOBLE S, 2018, DOI 10.2307/j.ctt1pwt9w5",93,2019,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1113784412,ISI,BI NORWEGIAN BUSINESS SCHOOL,BI NORWEGIAN BUSINESS SCHOOL,NA,"LUTZ C, 2019, HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES","LUTZ C, 2019, HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES",NORWAY,10.1002/hbe2.140,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1113784412,NA,NA,NA,"THE RESEARCH COUNCIL OF NORWAY,RCN,OSLO,NORWAY",DIM

THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON EXPLORING SELF-EFFICACY AND ANXIETY IN THIS GROUP CONCERNING THE USE OF A SPECIFIC E-SERVICE, INTERNET BANKING SERVICE. CONSIDERING THE TRIADIC RELATION PROPOSED IN SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY, WE INCLUDE IN THE MODEL OF IBS USE BY OLDER ADULTS PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS SELF-EFFICACY, ANXIETY, PERCEIVED USEFULNESS AND GENDER WITH RESPECT TO THE E-SERVICE CHOSEN. WE ANALYSE THE EFFECT OF PERCEIVED RISKS AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE ON THESE SELF-PERCEPTIONS AS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. THIS STUDY IS CENTRED ON A SURVEY OF 474 OLDER ADULTS AND TESTS THE STRUCTURAL MODEL PROPOSED USING PLS-SEM. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SELF-EFFICACY AND ANXIETY WHEN WE REFER TO TECHNOLOGY IN GENERAL COMPARED WITH A SPECIFIC E-SERVICE.

THE DESIGN CHALLENGE HAS TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WE WANT TO LIVE, WORK, AND LEARN (AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS COMMUNITIES) AND WHAT WE VALUE AND APPRECIATE, E.G.: REFLECTING ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND CREATING INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES. AN OVERRIDING DESIGN TRADE-OFF FOR THE DIGITAL AGE IS WHETHER NEW DEVELOPMENTS WILL INCREASE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OR WILL CREATE MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES. SUSTAINING INCLUSIVE SOCIETIES MEANS ALLOWING PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND ALL ABILITIES TO EXPLOIT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR PERSONALLY MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES. META-DESIGN FOSTERS THE DESIGN OF SOCIO-TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT END-USER DEVELOPERS CAN MODIFY AND EVOLVE AT USE TIME TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND FAVOUR THEIR INCLUSION IN THE SOCIETY. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THREE CASE STUDIES IN THE DOMAIN OF ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES IN WHICH END USERS THEMSELVES CANNOT ACT AS END-USER DEVELOPERS, BUT SOMEONE ELSE (E.G.: A CAREGIVER OR A CLINICIAN) MUST ACCEPT THIS ROLE REQUIRING MULTI-TIERED ARCHITECTURES. THE DESIGN TRADE-OFFS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR META-DESIGN IDENTIFIED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CASE STUDIES AND OTHER RESEARCHERS’ PROJECTS ARE DESCRIBED TO INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE SOCIO-TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENTS FOCUSED ON SOCIAL INCLUSION.","UNIVERSITY OF BRESCIA, ITALY;UNIVERSITY OF BARI ALDO MORO, ITALY;UNIVERSITY OF YORK, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO BOULDER, UNITED STATES","UNIVERSITY OF BRESCIA,ITALY","GANTT M, 1992, DOI 10.1145/142750.142767; FISCHER G, 2006, DOI 10.1145/1133265.1133268; AHADANI M, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.proeng.2012.07.163; BØDKER S, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0020-7373(91)90030-b; FOGLI D, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-38706-7_12; BARAKOVA E, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2012.08.001; TETTEROO D, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2702123.2702504; COSTABILE M, 2006, DOI 10.4018/joeuc.2006100103; HERMANS F, 2011, DOI 10.1145/1985793.1985855; FISCHER G, 2001, DOI 10.1023/a:1011145532042; CABITZA F, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4471-6720-4_11; FISCHER G, 2006, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-5386-x_19; CARMIEN S, 2008, DOI 10.1145/1357054.1357151; REPENNING A, 1997, DOI 10.1145/1120212.1120231; CARMIEN S, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1067860.1067865; ARDITO C, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2399016.2399029; MARCHIORI E, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2011.09.017; REPENNING A, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2700517; WON M, 2006, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-5386-x_6; CELENTANO A, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-21530-8_15; TETTEROO D, 2014, DOI 10.4018/ijskd.2014010103; LIEBERMAN H, 2006, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-5386-x; F.PB, 1987, DOI 10.1109/mc.1987.1663532; FISCHER G, 2009, DOI 10.1109/ms.2009.134; COSTABILE M, 2007, DOI 10.1109/tsmca.2007.904776; CARMIEN S, 2016, DOI 10.2200/s00709ed1v01y201603arh010; ROMANO M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-48746-5_37; GARZOTTO F, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60131-1_36; SCAFFIDI C, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-58735-6_13; FISCHER G, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60291-2_4; PATERNÒ F, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-60291-2; BUCHINA N, 2016, DOI 10.1109/roman.2016.7745109; CREMA C, 2015, DOI 10.1109/memea.2015.7145252; ROSSON M, 2007, DOI 10.1109/vlhcc.2007.45; ARDITO C, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.12.002; FISCHER G, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3170706; TETTEROO D, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3154862.3154901; FOGLI D, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-76111-4_36; BUONO P, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-74433-9_10; VALTOLINA S, 2018, DOI 10.4018/ijskd.2018010101; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; CHESTA C, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3206505.3206582; BUONO P, 2018, DOI 10.1049/iet-sen.2017.0347; BARRICELLI B, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2018.11.041; MINAAM D, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.fcij.2018.11.008; SCHÖN D, 1998, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/3504.001.0001; HUTCHINS E, 1996, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/1881.001.0001",3,2019,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1117651917,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF BRESCIA;UNIVERSITY OF BARI ALDO MORO;UNIVERSITY OF YORK;UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO BOULDER,UNIVERSITY OF BRESCIA,NA,"FOGLI D, 2019, BEHAVIOUR AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY","FOGLI D, 2019, BEHAVIOUR AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY",ITALY; ITALY; UNITED KINGDOM; USA,10.1080/0144929x.2019.1634153,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1117651917,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS COULD OFFSET THE CONTINUOUSLY DECREASING INCOME FROM THE PAY-AS-YOU-GO PENSION SYSTEM, WHICH REMAINS THE MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME FOR OLDER HUNGARIANS.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAPER REVIEWS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF EMPLOYMENT OF OLDER PEOPLE AND HIGHLIGHTS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WHICH STILL RESTRICTS THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE LABOR MARKET. THE PAPER ANALYZES DATA FROM THE HUNGARIAN CARPOOLING COMPANY OSZKÁR AND COMPARES IT WITH OFFICIAL STATISTICAL DATA FROM THE HUNGARIAN LABOR MARKET, FOCUSING ON THE DYNAMICS OF THE EMPLOYMENT OF OLDER PERSONS.   FINDINGS THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE ALIENATION OF OLDER WORKERS FROM THE GIG ECONOMY IS JUST TRANSITORY, AND THAT AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF OLDER GIG WORKERS CAN BE ANTICIPATED.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS COMPILING DATA ON THE GIG ECONOMY FACES A NUMBER OF OBSTACLES, AS ENTERPRISES ARE DISINCENTIVIZED FROM REVEALING ALL THEIR DATA.   SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OLDER PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EMPLOYED IN LOWER-QUALITY JOBS, SUCH AS OWN-ACCOUNT SELF-EMPLOYED. THEY ARE ALSO INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY TO BECOME GIG WORKERS.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE PAPER ARTICULATES THE IMPORTANCE OF REMAINING ACTIVE AS ONE AGES AND MOREOVER CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL BELIEF THAT GIG JOBS MAINLY OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS.","CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY","CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST,HUNGARY","TAKÁCS J, 2013, DOI 10.1057/9781137318541_6; LEE R, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s10680-009-9186-x; GIANDREA M, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0164027509337195; GALLO W, 2006, DOI 10.1093/geronb/61.4.s221; DANIEL K, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.labeco.2005.05.009; NOSRATY L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2015.01.002; BLANCHFLOWER D, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s0927-5371(00)00011-7; BLOOM D, 2009, DOI 10.1007/s10887-009-9039-9; DINGEMANS E, 2013, DOI 10.1002/job.1914; ADAMS S, 2002, DOI 10.1007/s12122-002-1046-y; FRITZSCHE B, 2013, DOI 10.1111/j.1559-1816.2012.01004.x; DORDONI P, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s12126-015-9222-6; NEWBOLD K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tbs.2016.06.003; NG T, 2012, DOI 10.1111/peps.12003; BUSCHOFF K, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0958928708101867; BROCK G, 1995, DOI 10.4324/9780203811191; NEUMARK D, 1999, DOI 10.1086/250091; RUHM C, 1990, DOI 10.1086/298231; KATZ L, 2017, DOI 10.1257/aer.p20171092; HALL J, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0019793917717222; ALONSO-GARCÍA J, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1351847x.2017.1399429; CARLSTEDT A, 2018, DOI 10.3233/wor-182728; LAIN D, 2018, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x18001253; RATTEN V, 2019, DOI 10.1108/jec-08-2018-0054; KATZ L, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0019793918820008; BERDE E, 2019, DOI 10.3389/fsoc.2019.00008; JOHNES G, 2019, DOI 10.1108/jgr-09-2018-0037; VAN DALEN H, 2019, DOI 10.1093/workar/waz004; BERDE É, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s00391-019-01547-x; MILLIGAN K, 2019, DOI 10.1086/703255; BUTTON P, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-24135-3_9; MÄÄTTÄNEN N, 2014, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2496799; MARTIN J, 2018, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3177386",2,2019,"HUMAN RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1124815421,ISI,CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST,CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST,NA,"BERDE É, 2019, JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY","BERDE É, 2019, JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY",HUNGARY,10.1108/jec-09-2019-0092,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1124815421,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

I LOOKED AT HOW A DIGITAL DIVISION AT A LARGE AGRICULTURAL MULTINATIONAL IS USING SMART INFORMATION SYSTEMS (SIS), THROUGH THEIR SISPROJECT, TO PROVIDE FARMERS WITH LOCAL WEATHER PREDICTIONS, FARM EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, AND EARLY DETECTION SYSTEMS FOR WEED, PESTS AND DISEASE. SIS BEING USED IN AGRICULTURE, TYPES OF DATA RETRIEVED FROM THE FARM, HOW THIS DATA IS ANALYSED, AND AGRIBUSINESSES INVOLVED IN THIS BURGEONING FIELD. AGRICULTURAL SIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AUTOMATE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TYPICALLY DONE BY AGRONOMISTS, ALLOWING FOR COST REDUCTIONS, QUICK AND EFFECTIVE CROP FORECASTING, AND IMPROVED DECISION-MAKING AND EFFICIENCY FOR THE FARMER. AGRICULTURAL SIS ALSO OFFERS AGRIBUSINESSES AN ADDITIONAL REVENUE, BETTER CUSTOMER-RELATIONS, AND REDUCED COSTS FROM HIRING ADDITIONAL AGRONOMISTS AND ADVISORS. THE WORLD’S POPULATION WILL EXCEED 9 BILLION BY 2050, FORCING THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR TO INCREASE ITS PRODUCTION LEVELS BY UP TO 70%. SIS ARE BEING HAILED AS ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO HELP PLANT, SEED, HARVEST, AND MANAGE FARMS BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVELY. HOWEVER, THE USE OF AGRICULTURAL SIS MAY CREATE A NUMBER OF ETHICAL CONCERNS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ACCURACY OF DATA AND RECOMMENDATIONS PROVIDED BY SIS MAY LEAD TO LOST HARVESTS, ILL LIVESTOCK, AND LOSS OF EARNINGS. THERE IS ALSO A TENSION BETWEEN ENSURING AN AGRIBUSINESSES’ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND THE PROTECTION OF THE FARMER’S DATA OWNERSHIP. THE USE OF SIS IS RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE, WHICH MAY CREATE A DIGITAL DIVIDE. AGRICULTURAL BIG DATA IS ALSO VULNERABLE TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY THREATS BECAUSE IT COULD BE USED NEFARIOUSLY BY CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS, COMPETITORS, OR EVEN MARKET TRADERS. SENSORS, ROBOTS AND DEVICES MAY CAUSE HARM, DISTRESS, AND DAMAGE TO ANIMAL WELFARE AND THE ENVIRONMENT.TO ASSESS IF THESE ETHICAL ISSUES MIRROR THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE FIELD, I INTERVIEWED THREE MEMBERS OF THIS COMPANY WORKING ON THEIR SIS PROJECT. THIS PROJECT COMBINES DATA RETRIEVED FROM THE FARMER WITH THE COMPANY’S AGRONOMIC KNOWLEDGE TO MANAGE THEIR FARM MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FARMERS WITH LOCAL WEATHER PREDICTIONS, PLANT DISEASE IN SITU DETECTION, AND RECOMMENDATION TOOLS TO MINIMISE RISK, CROP AND YIELD PREVIEWS, FARM EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY METRICS, AND EARLY DETECTION SYSTEMS FOR WEED, PESTS AND DISEASE. ONE OF THE PRIMARY MOTIVATIONS FOR USING SIS TECHNOLOGY FOR THE COMPANY IS THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE FARMER’S LIFE EASIER, MORE PRODUCTIVE, AND TO SAVE COSTS. THE AIM IS TO IMPROVE FARM MANAGEMENT, NOT BY INCREASING FERTILIZER USE, BUT BY MORE INTELLIGENT FARMING DECISIONS AND PRACTICES. THE ETHICAL ISSUES FACED IN THE PROJECT STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THOSE IN THE LITERATURE, WITH THE ADDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS CONCERNED THAT SIS WILL REPLACE HUMAN JOBS, SUCH AS THE AGRONOMIST, BUT THE TEAM STATED THAT THEIR SIS IS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT THE HUMAN EXPERT, RATHER THAN REPLACE THEM. ACCURACY AND AVAILABILITY OF DATA PROVED TO BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE NOT ALL FARMERS HAD AVAILABLE DATA AND DATA RETRIEVED FROM THIRD-PARTIES MAY NOT BE ACCURATE. THE TEAM ENSURE THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS’ PRIVACYIS PROTECTED BY HAVING STRONG SECURITY MEASURES TO AVOID MISUSE AND HACKING. DATA OWNERSHIP BELONGS TO THE FARMER AND THEY CAN MOVE TO A DIFFERENT FARM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SUPPLIER, WITH THAT DATA, IF THEY CHOOSE TO. THE TOOL IS FREE TO USE TO AVOID THE ISSUE OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE COMPANY INCORPORATE A STRONG SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA INTO THEIR SIS, DEVELOPING IT FROM THE EUROPEAN PEF (PRODUCT ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT) AND A LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) FRAMEWORK. OVERALL, MY REPORT WAS ABLE TO EVALUATE HOW ETHICAL ISSUES FOUND WITHIN THE SIS LITERATURE CORRELATE WITH THOSE IDENTIFIED, AND TACKLED, IN PRACTICE.","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NETHERLANDS","SYKUTA M, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6274-9_4; TAYLOR L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.geoforum.2015.07.002; ROSENHEIM J, 2016, DOI 10.1146/annurev-ento-031616-035444; KSHETRI N, 2014, DOI 10.1177/2053951714564227; LOKERS R, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.07.017; BRONSON K, 2016, DOI 10.1177/2053951716648174; CAROLAN M, 2016, DOI 10.1111/soru.12120; ZHANG H, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-19620-6_17; TAYLOR L, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-46608-8_2; RIBARICS P, 2016, DOI 10.19040/ecocycles.v2i1.54; WOLFERT S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.agsy.2017.01.023; O'GRADY M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.inpa.2017.05.001; TALAVERA J, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2017.09.015; KAMILARIS A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compag.2017.09.037; SCHÖNFELD M, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-62461-7_12; COBLE K, 2018, DOI 10.1093/aepp/ppx056; TZOUNIS A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2017.09.007; WOLFERT S, 2014, DOI 10.1109/srii.2014.47; HIRAFUJI M, 2014, DOI 10.1109/srii.2014.43; MOROTA G, 2018, DOI 10.1093/jas/sky014; CARBONELL I, 2016, DOI 10.14763/2016.1.405; COSMIN P, 2011, DOI 10.15835/buasvmcn-agr:6454",21,2019,"DATA MANAGEMENT AND DATA SCIENCE; AGRICULTURAL, VETERINARY AND FOOD SCIENCES; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; CROP AND PASTURE PRODUCTION",PUB.1116310859,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NA,"MARK R, 2019, ORBIT JOURNAL","MARK R, 2019, ORBIT JOURNAL",NETHERLANDS,10.29297/orbit.v2i2.109,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1116310859,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

IN THIS CONTEXT, ANALYSIS AND FORECAST OF THE LEVEL OF ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF ICT (INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES) BY HOUSEHOLDS IN THESE COUNTRIES HAS BECOME INTERESTING. IT ALLOWS FOR THE SELECTION OF DIGITALLY EXCLUDED REGIONS, OR THOSE THREATENED WITH THIS PHENOMENON IN THE COMING YEARS (2018–2020). TO CARRY OUT THE ANALYSIS, A FRAMEWORK BASED ON FUZZY NUMBERS AND THE NEAT F-PROMETHEE (NEW EASY APPROACH TO FUZZY-PROMETHEE) METHOD WAS DEVELOPED. THE POTENTIAL OF THE FUZZY OUTRANKING APPROACH TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE UNCERTAINTY OF INPUT DATA (CRITERIA AND PREFERENCES) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE IDI (ICT DEVELOPMENT INDEX) METHODOLOGY WIDELY USED IN RESEARCH ON REGIONAL ICT DEVELOPMENT BASED ON COMPOSITE INDICES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ESTONIA IS THE LEADER IN THE AREA OF ICT EXPANSION AMONG HOUSEHOLDS, AND IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WILL DEFINITELY MAINTAIN ITS DOMINANT POSITION. SLOVENIA FOLLOWS SHORTLY AFTER, FOLLOWED BY LATVIA.

THE CHAPTER REVIEWED EMERGING APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THE INTERNET OF THINGS, DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGIES AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AT VARIOUS PHASES OF THE AGRI-FOOD CHAIN, FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON SMART AND PRECISION FARMING, VALUE CHAIN INTEGRITY, PERSONALIZED NUTRITION AND THE REDUCTION AND PREVENTION OF FOOD WASTE. THE PAPER SHOWS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE FOCUS IS NOT LIMITED TO ONE SINGLE TECHNOLOGY, BUT TO THE WHOLE “TECHNOLOGY STACK”, INCLUDING SENSING, BIG DATA ANALYTICS, 5G, BLOCKCHAIN AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. MOREOVER, WEAKER PLAYERS SUCH AS SMALL FARMERS AND CONSUMERS ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO MAKE THE MOST OF THESE TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, AND THIS REQUIRES DEDICATED ACTION IN TERMS OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION. FURTHERMORE, BLOCKCHAIN AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN MASSIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE AGRI-FOOD CHAIN: HOWEVER, THEY FEATURE IMPORTANT GOVERNANCE CHALLENGES, WHICH CAN LEAD TO UNDESIRABLE RE-INTERMEDIATION EFFECTS (IN THE CASE OF BLOCKCHAIN); AND LOSS OF USER SELF-DETERMINATION AND AGENCY, AS WELL AS PRIVACY AND INTEGRITY (IN THE CASE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE). FINALLY, ANY SOLUTION THAT RELIES ON DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES WILL NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE, OTHERWISE THE RISK WILL BE TO WIDEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE: MORE GENERALLY, FOODTECH NEEDS TO DEVELOP IN WAY THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALL SDGS, NOT ONLY THOSE RELATED TO THE AGRI-FOOD SECTOR.","CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES, BELGIUM;COLLEGE OF EUROPE, BELGIUM","CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES,BELGIUM","COASE R, 1937, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x; WEZEL A, 2009, DOI 10.1051/agro/2009004; WILLIAMSON O, 1979, DOI 10.1086/466942; YIANNAS F, 2018, DOI 10.1162/inov_a_00266; LIAKOS K, 2018, DOI 10.3390/s18082674; SANDERSON J, 2018, DOI 10.5130/ijrlp.1.2018.6043; VERMA M, 2018, DOI 10.3389/fnut.2018.00117; KLASSON M, 2019, DOI 10.1109/wacv.2019.00058",15,2019,DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND SYSTEMS SOFTWARE; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1121646988,ISI,CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES;COLLEGE OF EUROPE,CENTRE FOR EUROPEAN POLICY STUDIES,NA,"RENDA A, 2019, NA","RENDA A, 2019, NA",BELGIUM; BELGIUM,10.1007/978-3-030-23969-5_10,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1121646988,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

WE IDENTIFIED A GROUP OF RESPONDENTS EVALUATING THEMSELVES AS HAVING MEAGRE DIGITAL SKILLS, VERY AFRAID THAT ROBOTS COULD STEAL THEIR JOBS AND WITH LOW USAGE OF THE INTERNET. THEY ARE ELDERLY, WITH A LOW LEVEL OF EDUCATION, MANUAL WORKERS OR NOT WORKING, WITH A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL OF INCOME AND LITTLE INTERNET USE. THE ORIGINALITY OF OUR APPROACH IS GIVEN BY THE FACT THAT WE FOCUSED ON INVESTIGATING IF DIGITAL DIVIDE LEADS TO THE CREATION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS (CITIZENS AND/OR COUNTRIES) AND IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC PATTERNS IN TERMS OF THE PERCEPTION ON BEING SKILLED IN THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN DAILY LIFE OR AT WORK AND OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ROBOTS REPLACE HUMAN ON THE LABOUR MARKET. WE AIM TO FIND RELEVANT FACTORS FOR THE LABOUR MARKET TO ASSUME TARGETED MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR A BETTER MATCH OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ON THE LABOUR MARKET AND FOR CREATING A SMART LABOUR MARKET. IT IS HIGHLY NEEDED TO INCREASE THE PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN THEIR SKILLS LEVEL AND TO MAKE THE MOST OF DIGITALISATION OF THE SOCIETIES. THE RESULTS SHOW CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN TERM OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND PERCEPTION TOWARDS DIGITALISATION. THE LATTER WILL HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND THE SOCIETY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IN THE NEXT PERIOD. THAT IS WHY A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS DIGITALISATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR TRANSFORMING THIS RELATIVELY NEW CHALLENGE INTO AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE.","BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES, ROMANIA;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES, ROMANIA;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES, ROMANIA;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES, ROMANIA;UNIVERSITY OF A CORUÑA, SPAIN","BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,ROMANIA","VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; NORDHAUS W, 2007, DOI 10.1017/s0022050707000058; FREY C, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2016.08.019; GOOS M, 2014, DOI 10.1257/aer.104.8.2509; DIMIAN G, 2016, DOI 10.5755/j01.ee.27.3.14028; ANDREI T, 2017, DOI 10.3390/e19090430; EICHHORST W, 2017, DOI 10.5771/0935-9915-2017-3-298; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.171; DEGRYSE C, 2016, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2730550; LYTRAS M, 2018, DOI 10.3390/su10061998; OECD O, 2001, DOI 10.1787/236405667766; GRAHAM M, 2014, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199661992.001.0001; DIMIAN G, 2018, DOI 10.3846/jbem.2018.6581; MÖNNIG A, 2019, DOI 10.1515/jbnst-2017-0151; ZEMTSOV S, 2019, DOI 10.17323/2500-2597.2019.2.84.96; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1646777; ARNTZ M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-57365-6_11-1; POULIAKAS K, 2018, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3253487",37,2020,"COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA STUDIES; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE",PUB.1126922214,ISI,BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;UNIVERSITY OF A CORUÑA,BUCHAREST UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMIC STUDIES,NA,"VASILESCU MD, 2020, PLOS ONE","VASILESCU MD, 2020, PLOS ONE",ROMANIA; SPAIN,10.1371/journal.pone.0232032,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1126922214,NA,NA,NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL,CNCS,BUCHAREST,ROMANIA",DIM

HOWEVER, CHILDREN OF TODAY ARE NOT EQUALLY EQUIPPED FOR THEIR TECHNOLOGY RICH FUTURE: VARIOUS KINDS OF DIGITAL DIVIDES STILL PREVAIL IN THE SOCIETY AND AFFECT THE YOUNG GENERATION AND THEIR DIGITAL FUTURES. SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION OF CHILDREN SHOULD UNDERGO AN EXTENSIVE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE YOUNG GENERATION AND THEIR DIGITALIZED FUTURE. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS SUDDENLY AND ABRUPTLY FORCED SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION INDEED TO ENGAGE IN SUCH A TRANSFORMATION. IN THIS STUDY WE EXAMINE THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE BASIC EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG GENERATION, THE VARIETY OF DIGITAL DIVIDES EMERGING AND REINFORCED, AND THE POSSIBLE BARRIERS REPORTED ALONG THE WAY. WE ARGUE THAT INFORMATION MANAGEMENT RESEARCH SHOULD BETTER ACKNOWLEDGE CHILDREN, THEIR DIGITALIZED EVERYDAY LIFE AND THEIR BASIC EDUCATION AS SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF CONCERN. WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THEM AS WELL AS ALLOW THEM TO SHAPE THE EDUCATION WE OFFER IN THE CONTEXT OF HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT WE SHOULD ALSO AIM AT INFLUENCING THE BASIC EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG GENERATION - FOR THE PURPOSE OF EQUIPPING THEM WITH IMPORTANT SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES FOR THEIR DIGITAL FUTURES BUT ALSO FOR THE PURPOSE OF AROUSING THEIR INTEREST IN THIS IMPORTANT FIELD, MAYBE EVEN AS A CAREER OPTION.","UNIVERSITY OF OULU, FINLAND;UNIVERSITY OF OULU, FINLAND;UNIVERSITY OF OULU, FINLAND","UNIVERSITY OF OULU,FINLAND","MARIËN I, 2014, DOI 10.1108/info-07-2014-0030; DE SOUZA Z, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2009.03.006; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; AGARWAL R, 2009, DOI 10.1287/isre.1080.0194; WARSCHAUER M, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i7.967; IVERSEN O, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3078072.3079725; SRIVASTAVA S, 2015, DOI 10.25300/misq/2015/39.1.11; RIGGINS F, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00074; IIVARI N, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3210586.3210600; VIAL G, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.003; GODHE A, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1475939x.2019.1610040; SONG Z, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102072; VAZQUEZ D, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102135; PATIL P, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102144; GENTINA E, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102134; PAPPAS I, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102128; REYES-MENENDEZ A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102129; PAPAGIANNIDIS S, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102166; CHANG C, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102115",386,2020,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES",PUB.1128815868,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF OULU;UNIVERSITY OF OULU;UNIVERSITY OF OULU,UNIVERSITY OF OULU,NA,"IIVARI N, 2020, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT","IIVARI N, 2020, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT",FINLAND,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102183,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1128815868,NA,NA,NA,"ACADEMY OF FINLAND,AKA,HELSINKI,FINLAND",DIM

HOWEVER, TO ENJOY THESE BENEFITS, PEOPLE NEED SKILLS TO USE THE IOT. THESE IOT SKILLS ARE EXPECTED TO DIFFER ACROSS THE GENERAL POPULATION, THEREBY CAUSING A NEW DIGITAL DIVIDE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS WHETHER A SAMPLE OF THE GENERAL DUTCH POPULATION CAN USE HEALTH IOT BY FOCUSING ON DATA AND STRATEGIC IOT SKILLS. FURTHERMORE, WE DETERMINE THE ROLE OF GENDER, AGE, AND EDUCATION, AND TRADITIONAL INTERNET SKILLS. METHODS: FROM APRIL 1, 2019, TO DECEMBER 12, 2019, 100 INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA DIGITAL FLYERS AND DOOR-TO-DOOR CANVASSING. A SELECTIVE QUOTA SAMPLE WAS DIVIDED INTO EQUAL SUBSAMPLES OF GENDER, AGE, AND EDUCATION. ADDITIONAL INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE SMARTPHONE POSSESSION AND NO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE OF USING ACTIVITY TRACKERS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 3 WAVES OVER A PERIOD OF 2 WEEKS. IN WAVE 1, A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO MEASURE THE OPERATIONAL, MOBILE, AND INFORMATION INTERNET SKILLS OF THE PARTICIPANTS, AND THE PARTICIPANTS WERE INTRODUCED TO THE ACTIVITY TRACKER. AFTER 1 WEEK OF GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACTIVITY TRACKER, A TASK-BASED PERFORMANCE TEST WAS CONDUCTED IN WAVE 2 TO MEASURE THE LEVELS OF DATA IOT SKILLS AND THE STRATEGIC IOT SKILL COMPONENT-ACTION PLAN CONSTRUCTION. A WEEK AFTER THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO USE THE ACTIVITY TRACKER MORE DELIBERATELY, A PERFORMANCE TEST WAS THEN CONDUCTED IN WAVE 3 TO MEASURE THE LEVEL OF THE STRATEGIC IOT SKILL COMPONENT-ACTION PLAN EXECUTION. RESULTS: THE PARTICIPANTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED 54% (13.5/25) OF THE DATA IOT SKILL TASKS. REGARDING STRATEGIC IOT TASKS, THE COMPLETION RATES WERE 56% (10.1/18) FOR ACTION PLAN CONSTRUCTION AND 43% (3.9/9) FOR ACTION PLAN EXECUTION. NONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL THE DATA IOT SKILL TASKS, AND NONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE ALL THE STRATEGIC IOT SKILL TASKS REGARDING ACTION PLAN CONSTRUCTION OR ITS EXECUTION. AGE AND EDUCATION WERE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF THE IOT SKILL LEVELS OF THE PARTICIPANTS, EXCEPT FOR THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE AN ACTION PLAN STRATEGICALLY. FURTHERMORE, THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION INTERNET SKILLS OF THE PARTICIPANTS CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR LEVEL OF DATA IOT SKILLS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY FOUND THAT DATA AND STRATEGIC IOT SKILLS OF DUTCH CITIZENS ARE UNDERDEVELOPED WITH REGARD TO HEALTH PURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, THOSE WHO COULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM HEALTH IOT WERE THOSE WHO HAD THE MOST TROUBLE USING IT, THAT IS, THE OLDER AND LOWER-EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS.","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NETHERLANDS","HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; GOULDING A, 2003, DOI 10.1177/034003520302900109; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2010.496338; CHEONG P, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1461444808094356; LITT E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813475424; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.001; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/01972243.2015.1069770; NETER E, 2012, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1619; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; NOH Y, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.acalib.2015.08.020; BARNAGHI P, 2012, DOI 10.4018/jswis.2012010101; CERIN E, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.02.012; SCHERER R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tsc.2015.04.004; VAN DEURSEN A, 2011, DOI 10.2196/jmir.1581; PRADO J, 2013, DOI 10.1515/libri-2013-0010; WASSERMAN I, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00301.x; VAN DEURSEN A, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2008.11.002; KARVALICS L, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-14136-7_5; GREENE J, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2014.03.008; LEE H, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.006; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; HARGITTAI E, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00389.x; HALE T, 2013, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.777759; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323113499113; HARGITTAI E, 2005, DOI 10.1177/0894439305275911; MERCER K, 2016, DOI 10.2196/mhealth.4225; XIE B, 2003, DOI 10.4017/gt.2003.02.04.002.00; SITZMAN K, 2003, DOI 10.1177/216507990305100908; VAN LAAR E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; ALMOTIRI H, 2016, DOI 10.1109/w-ficloud.2016.24; PANGRAZIO L, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3097286.3097338; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.171; THOMPSON K, 2005, DOI 10.29173/iq795; MEINERT E, 2018, DOI 10.2196/12077; DE BOER P, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2018.12.004; VAN DER ZEEUW A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818821067; LEE B, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-22012-9_18; VAN DEURSEN A, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1646777",4,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HEALTH SERVICES AND SYSTEMS; HEALTH SCIENCES,PUB.1132688654,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE,NA,"DE BOER PS, 2020, JMIR HUMAN FACTORS","DE BOER PS, 2020, JMIR HUMAN FACTORS",NETHERLANDS,10.2196/22532,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1132688654,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTATIONAL FACILITIES ARE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING CONSIDERABLE VOLUMES OF DATA, YET OFTEN LACK AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE TO GUIDE THE USER IN SUPERVISING AND ADJUSTING BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSIS VIA A TABLET OR SMARTPHONE. RESULTS: TO ADDRESS THIS GAP WE PROPOSED TELESCOPE, A NOVEL TOOL THAT INTERFACES WITH HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTATIONAL CLUSTERS TO DELIVER AN INTUITIVE USER INTERFACE FOR CONTROLLING AND MONITORING BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES IN REAL-TIME. BY LEVERAGING LAST GENERATION TECHNOLOGY NOW UBIQUITOUS TO MOST RESEARCHERS (SUCH AS SMARTPHONES), TELESCOPE DELIVERS A FRIENDLY USER EXPERIENCE AND MANAGES CONECTIVITY AND ENCRYPTION UNDER THE HOOD. CONCLUSIONS: TELESCOPE HELPS TO MITIGATE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN WET AND COMPUTATIONAL LABORATORIES IN CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY. BY DELIVERING CONVENIENCE AND EASE OF USE THROUGH A USER EXPERIENCE NOT RELYING ON EXPERTISE WITH COMPUTATIONAL CLUSTERS, TELESCOPE CAN HELP RESEARCHERS CLOSE THE FEEDBACK LOOP BETWEEN BIOINFORMATICS AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK WITH MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS.

MOREOVER, IN RECENT YEARS, WHEN CONSIDERING HOW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED INTO OLDER PEOPLE'S LIVES, AND HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS INFLUENCED THESE INDIVIDUALS, DOUBTS REMAIN REGARDING WHETHER TECHNOLOGIES REALLY FULFIL OLDER USERS' NEEDS AND WISHES AND WHETHER TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR OLDER USERS NECESSARILY PROTECT AND CONSIDER MAIN ETHICAL VALUES. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE ADDRESS THE RELEVANCE OF PRIVACY, VULNERABILITY AND PRESERVATION OF AUTONOMY AS KEY FACTORS WHEN INVOLVING OLDER INDIVIDUALS AS TARGET USERS FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE PROVIDE EXPLANATORY EXAMPLES ON ETHICAL ISSUES INVOLVED IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF DEVELOPING DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY FOR OLDER PEOPLE (FROM ROBOTICS TO SERIOUS GAMES), WHAT PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED RESEARCH TELLS US ABOUT OLDER ADULTS' PREFERENCES AND WISHES FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT STEPS SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE.","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, MAYNOOTH, IRELAND;DUBLIN CITY UNIVERSITY, IRELAND;NIVELY SAS, FRANCE, FRANCE","NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, MAYNOOTH,IRELAND","DOYLE J, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s10209-013-0308-1; KÖRTNER T, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s00391-016-1066-5; CURRIE M, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s12913-015-0825-0; BIANCO M, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2996267.2996268; GAJADHAR B, 2010, DOI 10.1145/1823818.1823826; CORADESCHI S, 2011, DOI 10.1145/1957656.1957660; MAN M, 2010, DOI 10.5772/13547; LEE I, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.014; IM D, 2015, DOI 10.5535/arm.2015.39.3.462; SCHALL M, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0018720812462029; SEEMAN T, 2001, DOI 10.1037/0278-6133.20.4.243; CONSOLVO S, 2004, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-30119-6_1; EIZENMAN D, 1997, DOI 10.1037/0882-7974.12.3.489; COLCOMBE S, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1467-9280.t01-1-01430; KIM K, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.exger.2016.11.013; FUJITA M, 2001, DOI 10.1177/02783640122068092; BOUAKAZ S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.irbm.2014.02.011; WU Y, 2015, DOI 10.2147/cia.s72399; AHN J, 2015, DOI 10.1145/2808207; AJZEN I, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t; SORELL T, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10676-014-9344-7; FISCHER S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.06.005; MCCALLUM S, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-40790-1_2; CAVALLO F, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s12559-014-9290-z; ZONNEVELD A, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s12439-015-0129-1; RUSCH M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.aap.2014.05.020; KHOO E, 2008, DOI 10.1007/s10055-008-0083-0; PEEK S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.01.004; VAN VELDHOVEN E, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-89617-3_9; CORADESCHI S, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-08491-6_22; SIRIARAYA P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2012.691552; VAN BREEMEN A, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1082473.1082823; BAKER S, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2996267.2996271; JOSEPH P, 2014, DOI 10.1515/ijdhd-2014-0322; DE SCHUTTER B, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814522945; CASEY D, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-41264-1_44; YOO H, 2013, DOI 10.1589/jpts.25.797; DE GRAAF M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s12369-016-0368-5; MARSON D, 1995, DOI 10.1001/archneur.1995.00540340029010; SMARR C, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s12369-013-0220-0; FISCHINGER D, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2014.09.029; GRAF B, 2004, DOI 10.1023/b:auro.0000016865.35796.e9; IENCA M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s12369-016-0366-7; DÍAZ-ORUETA U, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-5170-5_7; MILLER L, 2000, DOI 10.1076/1382-5585(200006)7:2; PARSONS T, 2008, DOI 10.1089/cpb.2007.9934; DIAZ-ORUETA U, 2012, DOI 10.1089/g4h.2011.0024; PHANG C, 2006, DOI 10.1109/tem.2006.883710; PEARCE C, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1555412008314132; QUANDT T, 2008, DOI 10.1177/1555412008325480; DENECKE K, 2015, DOI 10.15265/iy-2015-001; SARACCHINI R, 2015, DOI 10.3916/c45-2015-07; HOOF J, 2007, DOI 10.4017/gt.2007.06.03.005.00; BADII A, 2009, DOI 10.4017/gt.2009.08.03.008.00; DIAZ U, 2010, DOI 10.4017/gt.2010.09.02.267.00; NAP H, 2014, DOI 10.4017/gt.2015.13.3.002.00; GOLANT S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2017.07.003; IENCA M, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s11948-017-9976-1; HAESNER M, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.09.006; GARCÍA-SOLER Á, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.archger.2017.10.024; HAARMAN J, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.humov.2017.10.005; BENNETT B, 2017, DOI 10.2471/blt.16.187484; HOE Z, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10209-017-0597-x; SÁNCHEZ V, 2017, DOI 10.1017/s0266462317000964; HUGHES J, 2002, DOI 10.1177/014107680209500507; WADA K, 2003, DOI 10.1109/iros.2003.1249302; GRAF B, 2009, DOI 10.1109/arso.2009.5587059; WADA K, 2005, DOI 10.1109/iros.2005.1545304; STIEHL W, 2006, DOI 10.1109/ccnc.2006.1593253; PELEG-ADLER R, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.12.003; WHELAN S, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s12369-018-0471-x; ROBILLARD J, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.jalz.2018.04.012; HOPPER L, 2018, DOI 10.1093/ageing/afy140.43; HOPPER L, 2018, DOI 10.1093/ageing/afy140.53; WEERASINGHE M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-15620-6_1; SCHLOMANN A, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-15620-6_7; HALL A, 2019, DOI 10.1186/s12877-019-1155-6; BARRETT E, 2019, DOI 10.3928/00989134-20190531-01",13,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HEALTH SERVICES AND SYSTEMS; HEALTH SCIENCES,PUB.1124240303,ISI,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND;DUBLIN CITY UNIVERSITY,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND,NA,"DIAZ-ORUETA U, 2020, HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL","DIAZ-ORUETA U, 2020, HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL",IRELAND; IRELAND,10.1177/1460458219899590,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1124240303,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

IN LINE WITH DIGITALIZATION DEVELOPMENT, SOCIETY IS ALSO CHANGING, AND MANY ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES TODAY TAKE PLACE ON THE INTERNET. THIS DEVELOPMENT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THOSE OLDER PERSONS WHO DO NOT USE THE INTERNET OR DO NOT FOLLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES ON THE INTERNET FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO TAKE PART IN INFORMATION AND ACTIVITIES THAT NO LONGER OCCUR IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD. THIS HAS LED TO A DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN GROUPS, WHERE THE OLDER GENERATIONS (60+), IN PARTICULAR, HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. IN A LARGE STUDY OF SWEDEN'S ADULT POPULATION IN 2019, 95 PERCENT OF THE OVERALL POPULATION WAS SAID TO BE INTERNET USERS, AND THE CORRESPONDING NUMBER FOR USERS OVER 66 YEARS OF AGE WAS 84%. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE NUMBERS REPORTED ABOUT OLDER PEOPLES' INTERNET USE, MOST LIKELY, ARE VASTLY OVERESTIMATED AND THAT REAL USE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE OLDEST AGE GROUPS. WE REPORT THAT 62.4% OF THE STUDY SUBJECTS ARE INTERNET USERS AND THAT THIS NUMBER MOST LIKELY ALSO IS AN OVERESTIMATION. WHEN LOOKING AT NONRESPONDERS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE, WE FIND THAT THEY DISPLAY CHARACTERISTICS GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED TO NON-USE, SUCH AS LOWER EDUCATION, LOWER HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY, AND LOWER COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING.","BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SE-371 79 KARLSKRONA, SWEDEN;, LISA.SKAR@BTH.SE, (L.S.);, LINDA.ABRAHAMSSON@BTH.SE, (L.A.);, JOHAN.SANMARTIN.BERGLUND@BTH.SE, (J.S.B.), SWEDEN;UNIVERSITY OF SKÖVDE, SWEDEN;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SE-371 79 KARLSKRONA, SWEDEN;, LISA.SKAR@BTH.SE, (L.S.);, LINDA.ABRAHAMSSON@BTH.SE, (L.A.);, JOHAN.SANMARTIN.BERGLUND@BTH.SE, (J.S.B.), SWEDEN;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SE-371 79 KARLSKRONA, SWEDEN;, LISA.SKAR@BTH.SE, (L.S.);, LINDA.ABRAHAMSSON@BTH.SE, (L.A.);, JOHAN.SANMARTIN.BERGLUND@BTH.SE, (J.S.B.), SWEDEN;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SE-371 79 KARLSKRONA, SWEDEN;, LISA.SKAR@BTH.SE, (L.S.);, LINDA.ABRAHAMSSON@BTH.SE, (L.A.);, JOHAN.SANMARTIN.BERGLUND@BTH.SE, (J.S.B.), SWEDEN","BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,SWEDEN","FRIEMEL T, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0267323115578059; KAYE J, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.jalz.2013.01.011; SLEGERS K, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.003; DE VEER A, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s12913-015-0765-8; O’BRYANT S, 2008, DOI 10.1001/archneur.65.7.963; LAGERGREN M, 2004, DOI 10.1007/bf03324546; SEIFERT A, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s00391-015-0965-1; LINDBERG B, 2013, DOI 10.1155/2013/461829; BERNER J, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1460458212462151; BERNER J, 2016, DOI 10.4017/gt.2016.14.3.012.00; OLSSON T, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1355007; BALL C, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0733464817732518; KÖNIG R, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0609-5; SZABO A, 2018, DOI 10.1093/geront/gny036; HOLTHE T, 2018, DOI 10.2147/cia.s154717; HUNSAKER A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1461444818787348; MARTÍNEZ-ALCALÁ C, 2018, DOI 10.3389/fict.2018.00021; JIN Y, 2019, DOI 10.2196/14210; BERNER J, 2019, DOI 10.1017/s1041610219000668",11,2020,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA STUDIES; LANGUAGE, COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE",PUB.1133259257,ISI,BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF SKÖVDE;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,BLEKINGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,NA,"ANDERBERG P, 2020, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","ANDERBERG P, 2020, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH",SWEDEN; SWEDEN,10.3390/ijerph17239050,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1133259257,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS RESEARCH OFFERS SOME INSIGHTS INTO THE TOPIC BY ANALYZING THE E-GOVERNMENT ADOPTION OR PRACTICAL USE OF E-GOVERNMENT ACROSS EUROPE (26 EU COUNTRIES). BASED ON THE DATA PROVIDED BY THE STATISTICAL OFFICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (EUROSTAT), WE DEFINED TWO INDEXES, THE E-GOVERNMENT USE INDEX (EGUI) AND AN EXTREME VERSION OF IT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ONLY NULL OR COMPLETE USE (EGUI+), AND CHARACTERIZED THE USE/NON USE OF E-GOVERNMENT TOOLS USING SUPERVISED LEARNING PROCEDURES IN A SELECTION OF COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT E-GOVERNMENT ADOPTION LEVELS. THESE PROCEDURES ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE ACCURACY OF 73% AND DETERMINED THE MAIN FACTORS RELATED TO THE PRACTICAL USE OF E-GOVERNMENT IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES, E.G. THE FREQUENCY OF BUYING GOODS OVER THE INTERNET OR THE EDUCATION LEVEL. IN ADDITION, WE COMPARED THE PROPOSED INDEXES TO OTHER INDEXES MEASURING THE LEVEL OF E-READINESS OF A COUNTRY SUCH AS THE E-GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT INDEX (EGDI) ITS ONLINE SERVICE INDEX (OSI) COMPONENT, THE NETWORKED READINESS INDEX (NRI) AND ITS GOVERNMENT USAGE COMPONENT (GU). THE RANKING COMPARISON FOUND THAT EGUI+ IS CORRELATED WITH THE FOUR INDEXES MENTIONED AT 0.05 SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL, AS THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES WERE RANKED IN SIMILAR POSITIONS. THE OUTCOMES CONTRIBUTE TO GAINING UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE USE OF E-GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE AND THE DIFFERENT ADOPTION LEVELS.","UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY, SPAIN","UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY,SPAIN","BÉLANGER F, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2007.12.002; NAM T, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2013.09.006; CARTER L, 2005, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00183.x; SHAREEF M, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2010.05.006; HALL M, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1656274.1656278; THOMPSON D, 2005, DOI 10.1108/09564230510614022; SERI P, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.03.004; LAYNE K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00066-1; KABBAR E, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-3-7091-1425-4_7; PÉREZ J, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.patrec.2006.08.013; KENDALL M, 1938, DOI 10.1093/biomet/30.1-2.81; MILENKOVIC M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0266666915593136; KENDALL M, 1938, DOI 10.2307/2332226; DADA D, 2006, DOI 10.1002/j.1681-4835.2006.tb00183.x; MACHOVA R, 2016, DOI 10.29379/jedem.v8i1.412",25,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1126765844,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY;UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY;UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY;UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY,UNIVERSITY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY,NA,"YERA A, 2020, PLOS ONE","YERA A, 2020, PLOS ONE",SPAIN,10.1371/journal.pone.0231585,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1126765844,NA,NA,NA,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM;BASQUE GOVERNMENT,MINECO,VITORIA-GASTEIZ,SPAIN;MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS,EC,MADRID,SPAIN",DIM

ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE LIVES OF ITALIANS WERE FORCED TO SHIFT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS ISSUED BY GOVERNMENT. THIS CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF ITALIANS CAN BE MIRRORED BY AN ADJUSTMENT IN FOOD CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR THAT, CONSEQUENTLY, BROUGHT ABOUT A TRANSITION IN THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN. THIS PAPER GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT CHANGES IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS THAT OCCURRED DUE TO THE ITALIAN LOCKDOWN, AND HOW EVOLUTIONS IN BEHAVIOUR ARE INTERTWINED WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAIN FOOD SUPPLY CHAINS. MANY OF THE EVENTS HERE DEPICTED ARE LIKELY TO LAST FAR BEYOND THE CRISIS AND AFFECT THE SUBSEQUENT EVOLUTION OF FOOD CONSUMPTION IN ITALY. THE ITALIAN RETAIL SUPPLY CHAIN SUCCESSFULLY ADAPTED TO THE BIG SHIFT IN CONSUMPTION. DESPITE PURCHASES FOR ESSENTIAL ITEMS HAVING INCREASED, NO STOCKOUT HARMED THE FOOD SECURITY OF ITALIANS. OUT-OF-HOME CONSUMPTION MOVED INSIDE HOUSES GIVING SPACE TO HOME MEAL PREPARATION AND COMFORT FOOD. HOME DELIVERY HAS BEEN THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THIS CONTEXT, AS IT BOOMED DURING THIS PERIOD, HELPING LAGGARD CONSUMERS FILL THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, AS IT WAS MOSTLY MEDIATED BY E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS AND INSTANT MESSAGING. IT WAS ALSO THE LEVERAGE THAT ALLOWED SMALL RETAILERS AND SMALL PRODUCERS REGAIN THEIR SPACE. THIS CRISIS CALLS FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM THAT WILL BE INCREASINGLY ORIENTED TO MOVING GOODS RATHER THAN PEOPLE, WHICH WILL ALSO HAVE RELEVANCE IN THE COMING YEARS.","UNIVERSITY OF NAPLES FEDERICO II, ITALY;FREE UNIVERSITY OF BOZEN-BOLZANO, ITALY;CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF THE SACRED HEART, ITALY","FREE UNIVERSITY OF BOZEN-BOLZANO,ITALY","SADLER M, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.tifs.2003.09.003; LOBB A, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.foodqual.2006.04.004; WILSON K, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10705422.2015.1091419; MARINELLI N, 2015, DOI 10.1108/nfs-03-2014-0022; WANSINK B, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0031-9384(03)00203-8; FOLKE C, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2006.04.002; HAMBURG M, 2014, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00032; BABIN B, 1994, DOI 10.1086/209376; CEMBALO L, 2019, DOI 10.3390/ijerph16010165; CARFORA V, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.03.006; JÁUREGUI-LOBERA I, 2020, DOI 10.5772/intechopen.91734; RUNDLE A, 2020, DOI 10.1002/oby.22813; HOBBS J, 2020, DOI 10.1111/cjag.12237; LONG N, 2020, DOI 10.29333/ejmste/8207; CRANFIELD J, 2020, DOI 10.1111/cjag.12246; CALORI A, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s10460-020-10111-y; AYMERICH-FRANCH L, 2020, DOI 10.31234/osf.io/9vm7r; KIRK C, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.05.028; ZWANKA R, 2020, DOI 10.1080/08961530.2020.1771646; KOTLER P, 2020, DOI 10.1177/2394964320922794; DI RENZO L, 2020, DOI 10.1186/s12967-020-02399-5; UELAND Ø, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.tifs.2020.05.021; DE PAULO FARIAS D, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.tifs.2020.05.023; ALDACO R, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140524; BÉNÉ C, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s12571-020-01076-1; LAGUNA L, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.104028; DAMMEYER J, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.paid.2020.110263; SUN F, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.07.014; HALL M, 2021, DOI 10.1108/josm-05-2020-0151; BUTU A, 2020, DOI 10.3390/ijerph17155485; LOXTON M, 2020, DOI 10.3390/jrfm13080166; WANG E, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s12571-020-01092-1; DE LA HOZ-RESTREPO F, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijid.2020.08.017; ARELLANA J, 2020, DOI 10.1155/2020/8867316; MOLLENKOPF D, 2020, DOI 10.1108/josm-05-2020-0143",51,2020,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; AGRICULTURAL, VETERINARY AND FOOD SCIENCES; FOOD SCIENCES",PUB.1133319147,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF NAPLES FEDERICO II;FREE UNIVERSITY OF BOZEN-BOLZANO;CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF THE SACRED HEART,FREE UNIVERSITY OF BOZEN-BOLZANO,NA,"CAVALLO C, 2020, HELIYON","CAVALLO C, 2020, HELIYON",ITALY; ITALY; ITALY,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05676,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1133319147,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

ALTHOUGH KNOWLEDGE ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND DIGITAL INCLUSION AMONG NATIVE OLDER ADULTS HAS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SITUATIONS OF OLDER IMMIGRANTS IN RELATION TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS PAPER EMPLOYED THE SCOPING REVIEW APPROACH TO MAP THE SITUATIONS AND RESEARCH METHODS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG OLDER IMMIGRANTS FROM RECENT EMPIRICAL STUDIES. THE INITIAL SEARCH IDENTIFIED 997 ARTICLES, OF WHICH 13 ARTICLES WERE SELECTED FOR THIS REVIEW. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY, DEGREE OF ACCULTURATION, LEVEL OF EDUCATION, AND DIGITAL LITERACY ARE THE MOST COMMON FACTORS LEADING TO THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN NATIVE OLDER ADULTS AND OLDER IMMIGRANTS. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS SHOWED A NARROWING GAP AS CONCERNS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE DIVIDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES DUE TO DISPARITIES IN DIGITAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE. THE INCLUDED STUDIES APPLIED QUANTITATIVE, QUALITATIVE, AND MIXED-METHOD APPROACHES. THE HOMOGENEITY OF THE FINDINGS OF SOME INCLUDED STUDIES IMPLIED THE NEED TO DEVELOP MORE METHODS AND MODELS TO STUDY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG OLDER IMMIGRANTS. THIS REVIEW SUGGESTED THAT FUTURE RESEARCH INCORPORATE ETHNIC CHARACTERISTICS IN THE RESEARCH DESIGN TO PROVIDE IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ETHNIC GROUP. THIS KNOWLEDGE COULD POTENTIALLY BE UTILIZED FOR FUTURE INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT NARROWING THE REMAINING GAP OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.","ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;MALMÖ UNIVERSITY, SWEDEN","ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,SWEDEN","FRIEMEL T, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; VAN DEURSEN A, 2014, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2013.858458; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; HASAN H, 2016, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2016.1205425; DEROSE K, 2007, DOI 10.1377/hlthaff.26.5.1258; ZIBRIK L, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.hlpt.2015.08.002; DEKKER R, 2015, DOI 10.1002/psp.1938; LISSITSA S, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.08.001; BJARNADOTTIR R, 2016, DOI 10.3109/17538157.2015.1064429; SARRÍA-SANTAMERA A, 2016, DOI 10.1186/s40985-016-0042-3; MAKAROVA N, 2016, DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007875; YARDLEY L, 2015, DOI 10.1111/bjhp.12126; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; VAN ROMPAEY V, 2002, DOI 10.1080/13691180210130770; SCHULZ R, 2014, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnu071; COLQUHOUN H, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2014.03.013; MASSEY P, 2016, DOI 10.1080/13557858.2016.1244745; ARKSEY H, 2005, DOI 10.1080/1364557032000119616; FERREIRA S, 2016, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2016.1265150; LISSITSA S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2015.06.002; KANIA-LUNDHOLM M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jaging.2015.07.008; LIU X, 2016, DOI 10.1111/hsc.12357; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; ÖSTLUND B, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2014.04.012; CHANG J, 2014, DOI 10.1080/01634372.2014.913754; CASTAÑEDA H, 2014, DOI 10.1146/annurev-publhealth-032013-182419; KOEHN S, 2012, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x12000013; SELWYN N, 2003, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x03001302; HSU Y, 2016, DOI 10.4017/gt.2016.14.4.011.00; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; MILLWARD P, 2003, DOI 10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066; BALLANTYNE G, 2017, DOI 10.1080/21931674.2016.1277856; NGUYEN A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.04.008; NEVES B, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2017.1348534; VAN REGENMORTEL S, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s12062-017-9196-0; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; ANDONIAN L, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0008417418754395; MILLARD A, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.puhe.2018.03.005; ZHAO X, 2018, DOI 10.1080/10410236.2018.1475999; KUOPPAMÄKI S, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2018.07.003; CASTLES S, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-0-230-36639-8; MIHELJ S, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818822816; BREUNIG R, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2019.101837; GOLUB A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.cstp.2019.10.002",8,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1129130595,ISI,ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY;MALMÖ UNIVERSITY,ROYAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,NA,"CHEN X, 2020, NA","CHEN X, 2020, NA",SWEDEN; SWEDEN,10.1007/978-3-030-50232-4_13,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1129130595,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE AUTHORS CRITICALLY ANALYZE THE EXISTING SOURCES OF STATISTICAL INFORMATION AND THE EXISTING SYSTEM OF INDICATORS CHARACTERIZING THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF ICT BY THE POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLDS IN RUSSIA. THE INDICATORS USED FOR ASSESSING THE DIGITAL TERRITORIAL DIFFERENCES BASED ON THE RESOURCE-TARGET APPROACH WERE SELECTED. THE DEGREE OF UNEVENNESS OF THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONS WITHIN THE FEDERAL DISTRICTS AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE IS ESTIMATED. THE INFLUENCE OF THE TERRITORIAL FACTOR ON THE FORMATION OF INDICATORS OF ACCESSIBILITY AND ICT USE WAS REVEALED, AND THE DEGREE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF AVAILABILITY AND USE OF ICT IN THE REGIONS OF RUSSIA WAS ASSESSED. AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT THE LARGEST DIGITAL GAP IN THE REGIONS OF RUSSIA OCCURS IN THE AFFORDABILITY OF ICT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF SKILLS FOR ITS USE. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS A DEFINITE TENDENCY TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OF THE REGIONS IN THESE INDICATORS. THE VARIANCE ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE REGIONAL FACTOR ON THE FORMATION OF ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF ICT BY THE POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLDS. THE ANALYSIS OF REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN THE DIGITALIZATION PROCESSES SHOWED THAT THE PROBLEM OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY IS MOST ACUTE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS COMPARED WITH URBAN AREAS. THE STUDY OF THE DEGREE OF CORRELATION BETWEEN ACCESSIBILITY AND USE OF ICT IN THE REGIONS OF RUSSIA SHOWED THAT THE LEVEL OF SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS THE MATERIAL CAPABILITIES OF THE POPULATION, WHICH MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DEVELOPING MEASURES TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ARE THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS.","STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT, RUSSIA;STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT, RUSSIA;FINANCIAL UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA","STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT,RUSSIA","KATZ J, 1997, DOI 10.1108/10662249710171814; HOFFMAN D, 1996, DOI 10.1145/240483.240490; BYCHKOVA S, 2019, DOI 10.21686/2500-3925-2019-1-32-40",2,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; HUMAN SOCIETY,PUB.1127572995,ISI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT;STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT;FINANCIAL UNIVERSITY,STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT,NA,"BYCHKOVA SG, 2020, NA","BYCHKOVA SG, 2020, NA",RUSSIA; RUSSIA,10.1007/978-3-030-44703-8_22,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1127572995,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

INFORMATIZATION PROVIDES AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SOCIETY ORGANIZATION, IN PARTICULAR, THE SPREAD OF INTEGRATION PROCESSES. ONE OF THESE INTEGRATION FORMS IS CLUSTERS, THE LEVEL AND EFFECT OF WHICH IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES DEMONSTRATES THE GROWTH OF COMPETITIVENESS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION.

WE ANALYSED THE MICRO-DATA OF THE ANNUAL NATIONAL SURVEY ON THE USE OF ICT BY GREEK HOUSEHOLDS FOR THE YEAR 2015. WE CONDUCTED HIERARCHICAL REGRESSIONS TO ASSESS IN THREE STAGES THE INFLUENCE OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS TO: (A) THE DECISION OF THE SENIORS TO ACCESS AND USE THE INTERNET, (B) THE EXTENT AND FREQUENCY OF INTERNET USE AND (C) SENIORS’ DIGITAL SKILLS. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, SOCIAL INEQUALITIES ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF SENIORS’ DECISION TO ACCESS AND USE THE INTERNET. THE SENIORS’ EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND GENDER ARE VERY IMPORTANT FACTORS LEADING TO AN ACCUMULATED ADVANTAGE, SINCE OLDER MEN AND WELL-EDUCATED SENIORS USE MORE EXTENSIVELY THE INTERNET AND ARE MORE DIGITALLY SKILLED.

DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE NEED FOR UNPAID CARE WORK INCREASED DUE TO RESTRICTED MOVEMENT, SOCIAL ISOLATION, AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. THIS PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE URGENCY OF RECOGNIZING AND VALUING WOMEN'S WORK AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL WHICH HAS BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY OVERLOOKED. AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS INCREASED THE DEMAND FOR TECHNOLOGY USAGE, EXPOSING THE GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE. THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN WOMEN ARE FACING, ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO BALANCE UNPAID CARE WORK WITH PAID EMPLOYMENT FROM THE SECLUSION OF THEIR HOMES. WE DO THIS BY REVIEWING A NUMBER OF SURVEYS CONDUCTED IN INDONESIA.

WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY STUDY WITH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS IN SPAIN. 67 TEACHERS COMPLETED AN ADAPTED VERSION OF SELFIE TO MEASURE THE WAY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED FOR TEACHING. RESPONDENTS WERE DIRECTED TO MARK TWO RESPONSES TO EACH SURVEY ITEM TO REFLECT THE SITUATIONS BOTH BEFORE AND DURING THE PANDEMIC. RESULTS INDICATE THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC TEACHERS HAD MORE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES, FOUND ONLINE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING TO BE OF GREATER USE, AND GAINED CONFIDENCE IN USING A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES FOR BOTH TEACHING AND COMMUNICATING WITH PARENTS AND STUDENTS. HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AMONG STUDENTS AND A LACK OF TECHNICAL RESOURCES AND SUPPORT AFFECTED THEIR ABILITIES TO CARRY OUT ONLINE EDUCATION EFFECTIVELY.

THE CURRENT WORLD OF COMMUNICATION CAN BE DESCRIBED BY TWO ASPECTS, NAMELY, THE VAST PROPORTION OF COMMUNICATION IS DONE ELECTRONICALLY AND IT IS MORE OR LESS ALWAYS INTERCULTURAL BECAUSE IT IS CONDUCTED THROUGH MODERN ELECTRONIC MEANS OF COMMUNICATION (EMAILS, SOCIAL MEDIA, PRESENTATIONS, ELEARNING, BLENDED LEARNING, MLEARNING, ETC.) IN THE GLOBAL WORLD OF INTERCONNECTEDNESS (THE WORLD WIDE WEB). THESE TWO ASPECTS ARE AT THE FOUNDATION OF BASICALLY ALL PROCESSES BOTH IT AND BUSINESS AND MUST NOT BE NEGLECTED. THE PAPER ATTEMPTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT A VAST PART OF INFORMATION CAN BE LOST DURING THE INFORMATION TRANSFER THROUGH COMMUNICATION, AND IT IS DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED COMBINATION OF INTERCULTURALITY AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS.

ALTHOUGH SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE MEANS AVAILABLE TO STREET GANGS TODAY, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY GANG AGREES ON THEIR USE. DRAWING ON DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES (EX-GANG MEMBERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT) ON GANGS USING A MULTI-METHOD DESIGN IN A LONDON BOROUGH, THE CURRENT STUDY SHOWS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE POLARIZED GANGS, RESULTING IN TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF DIGITAL ADAPTATION. THE PROPOSED DIVISION OF ‘DIGITALIST’ AND ‘TRADITIONALIST’ GANGS IS ROOTED IN THRASHER’S (1927) DICTUM THAT NO TWO GANGS ARE ALIKE AND EXPLAINS HOW SOME GANGS PREFER TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, THUS, AVOIDING SOCIAL MEDIA USE. ‘DIGITALISTS’, BY CONTRAST, PREFER TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WAY TO GAIN REPUTATION AND TERRITORIAL EXPANSION. THEY USE IT TO BRAND THEMSELVES AND TO APPEAR ATTRACTIVE FOR RECRUITS AND CUSTOMERS ALIKE. THESE DIFFERENCES CAN BE THEORETICALLY EXPLAINED FIRSTLY AS A GENERATIONAL GAP, MEANING THAT YOUNGER GANG MEMBERS PREFER THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA; AND SECONDLY, BY HOW WELL ESTABLISHED A GANG ALREADY IS, AS NEWER GANGS NEED MORE ATTENTION TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES.","LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;METROPOLITAN STATE UNIVERSITY, UNITED STATES;LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY,UNITED KINGDOM","KIM J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2011.01.002; BRAUN V, 2006, DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; PATTON D, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815625949; CAMPBELL A, 1989, DOI 10.1080/01639625.1989.9967815; HALL J, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444816660782; PYROOZ D, 2015, DOI 10.1002/9781118726822.ch3; DECKER S, 2012, DOI 10.1080/07418825.2012.732101; BECHMANN A, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1461444812462853; MOULE R, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10611-016-9661-3; AYLING J, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10611-011-9301-x; VAN HELLEMONT E, 2012, DOI 10.1163/092895612x13333546844518; MORSELLI C, 2013, DOI 10.1080/09592318.2013.740232; GOTTSCHALK P, 2016, DOI 10.1080/01639625.2016.1248713; DENSLEY J, 2013, DOI 10.1057/9781137271518; GOLDMAN L, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1368430214524289; PYROOZ D, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.11.018; SEO H, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813495162; KATZ C, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.10.004; PYROOZ D, 2013, DOI 10.1080/07418825.2013.778326; STORROD M, 2016, DOI 10.1080/13676261.2016.1260694; PATTON D, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.05.052; MOULE R, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.06.008; KUBRIN C, 2014, DOI 10.1177/2153368714525411; MOSER K, 2013, DOI 10.1027/1866-5888/a000079; PAPACHRISTOS A, 2009, DOI 10.1086/597791; MOULE R, 2014, DOI 10.1093/bjc/azu050; PYROOZ D, 2010, DOI 10.1177/0011128710372191; DENSLEY J, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0011128712437912; BORDUA D, 1966, DOI 10.2307/2091324; BACEV-GILES C, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.04.056; MCLEAN R, 2017, DOI 10.1080/01639625.2016.1272969; LAUGER T, 2017, DOI 10.1080/07418825.2017.1341542; PATTON D, 2017, DOI 10.1891/0886-6708.vv-d-16-00040; COOMBER R, 2017, DOI 10.1093/bjc/azx068; PATTON D, 2017, DOI 10.1177/2056305117733344; CAMPANA P, 2018, DOI 10.1093/bjc/azx078; BRADLEY S, 2019, DOI 10.1037/ppm0000164; KLEIN M, 2006, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195163445.001.0001; FRASER A, 2015, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198728610.001.0001; FELSON M, 2006, DOI 10.4135/9781452204260; URBANIK M, 2018, DOI 10.1093/bjc/azx083; PINKNEY C, 2018, DOI 10.1108/sc-01-2017-0004; PAYNE E, 1927, DOI 10.2307/2960917; LANE J, 2018, DOI 10.1093/jcmc/zmy019; ROBINSON G, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0306624x18806742; SUDBERY J, 2018, DOI 10.4324/9780203730386; IRWIN-ROGERS K, 2018, DOI 10.4324/9781315618777-33; ROKS R, 2019, DOI 10.1080/01639625.2019.1572301; WHITTAKER A, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10610-019-09408-4; PATTON D, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s42380-019-00014-w; STUART F, 2019, DOI 10.1093/socpro/spz010; PYROOZ D, 2019, DOI 10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.013.439; LAUGER T, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-90307-1_59-1; DENSLEY J, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1473225419883706; MCLEAN R, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-33362-1; MARTINEZ-RUIZ M, 2019, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02731; SANCHEZ-JANKOWSKI M, 1991, DOI 10.1525/9780520911314; JOHNSON J, 2016, DOI 10.21428/88de04a1.5e39c23c",9,2020,APPLIED AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY; COGNITIVE AND COMPUTATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; PSYCHOLOGY; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1127125424,ISI,LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY;METROPOLITAN STATE UNIVERSITY;LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY,LONDON SOUTH BANK UNIVERSITY,NA,"WHITTAKER A, 2020, COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR","WHITTAKER A, 2020, COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR",UNITED KINGDOM; USA,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106403,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1127125424,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IT AIMS IS TO MAKE VISIBLE THE CONSEQUENCES OF USUAL CONSTRAINTS –TECHNICAL OR NOT, AND COMMON UNCRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO FIGHTING UNNOTICED FORMS OF AGEISM IN THE AREA. COMPARED TO THE ONLINE ADULT POPULATION, THE COLLECTED SAMPLE SHOWS IMBALANCES THAT MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS: THERE ARE MORE MEN THAN WOMEN, THEY ARE YOUNGER AND BETTER EDUCATED THAN THE AVERAGE ONLINE POPULATION. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE RESEARCH PROJECT REFLECT THE EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDE, WHICH REMAINS OF PARTICULAR RELEVANCE AMONG THE OLDER AGE GROUPS OF THE POPULATION. WE DO ARGUE THAT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON DIGITAL PRACTICES, BEING IT CONDUCTED THROUGH ONLINE CHANNELS OR NOT, MUST CLEARLY STATE THE AGE RANGE OF THE SAMPLE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE LIMITATIONS IN REACHING THE OLDER OLD. IT IS CRITICAL TO FOLLOW SUCH A STRATEGY TO AVOID GENERALIZATIONS THAT, IN FACT, DISREGARD THE OLDER OLD AND, THEREFORE, CONTRIBUTE TO REINFORCE AGEISM.","OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, SPAIN;OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, SPAIN;OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, SPAIN","OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA,SPAIN","FRIEMEL T, 2014, DOI 10.1177/1461444814538648; MOEN P, 2006, DOI 10.1016/b978-012088388-2/50011-0; BRISTOW J, 2016, DOI 10.1057/978-1-137-60136-0; ALWIN D, 2003, DOI 10.1007/978-0-306-48247-2_2; PENISSAT E, 2014, DOI 10.1080/07036337.2014.990140; REVILLA M, 2012, DOI 10.1177/0759106312456510; GILLEARD C, 2005, DOI 10.1093/geronb/60.6.s305; ROSALES A, 2016, DOI 10.21018/rjcpr.2016.1.200; NEVES B, 2013, DOI 10.5153/sro.2998; BERGSTRÖM A, 2017, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0398; KÖNIG R, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10209-018-0609-5; AYALON L, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-73820-8; ROSALES A, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-92034-4_11; HARGITTAI E, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0894439318788322; OCHOA C, 2018, DOI 10.1177/1470785318779545; FERNÁNDEZ-ARDÈVOL M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-22015-0_4; SCHLOMANN A, 2020, DOI 10.1093/geroni/igz050",3,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1129129499,ISI,OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA;OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA;OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA,OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA,NA,"FERNÁNDEZ-ARDÈVOL M, 2020, NA","FERNÁNDEZ-ARDÈVOL M, 2020, NA",SPAIN,10.1007/978-3-030-50232-4_5,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1129129499,NA,NA,NA,"MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS,MINECO,MADRID,SPAIN",DIM

THIS INCLUDES THE CREATION OF NATIVE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH REFLECT LOCAL POLICIES AND POLITICS, MICROMANAGEMENT OF THE INTERNET FROM THE TOP DOWN, AND THE USE OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS (SDOS), SUCH AS THE UN AGENCY THE INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION UNION (ITU), TO LEGITIMIZE AND PROTECT THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE. ALTERNATE INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON A NEW ‘DECENTRALIZED INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE’ ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN SDOS AND MARKETED BY CHINESE COMPANIES. IN A WORST-CASE SCENARIO, THESE ALTERNATE TECHNOLOGIES AND A SUITE OF SUPPORTING STANDARDS COULD SPLINTER THE GLOBAL INTERNET’S SHARED AND UBIQUITOUS ARCHITECTURE. THEY ALSO PAVE THE WAY TO A NEW FORM OF INTERNET GOVERNANCE, ONE THAT IS MULTILATERAL INSTEAD OF MULTISTAKEHOLDER. A FRAGMENTED NETWORK WOULD INTRODUCE NEW CHALLENGES TO CYBER DEFENCE AND COULD PROVIDE ADVERSARIES WITH A TECHNICAL MEANS TO UNDERMINE THE NORMS, PREDICTABILITY AND SECURITY OF TODAY’S CYBERSPACE – WHICH WOULD ALSO IMPACT HUMAN RIGHTS AND WIDEN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. WESTERN NATIONS AND LIKE-MINDED ALLIES NEED TO INTENSIFY THEIR COOPERATION WITH ONE ANOTHER, INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS SUCH AS THE EU, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS LIKE INDUSTRY, ACADEMIA AND CIVIL SOCIETY TO UNDERSTAND AND LIMIT THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THESE NEW TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS.

IN RESPONSE, THE ASSISTED LIVING PROJECT ENGAGED OLDER ADULTS IN CO-CREATING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT USERS’ NEEDS, TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT EVERYDAY LIVING. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE HOW EIGHT OLDER ADULTS IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY IN NORWAY, AGED 81–92 YEARS, EVALUATED USER INCLUSION IN A 3-YEAR TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED RESEARCH PROJECT. INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, DIALOGUE CAFÉS, INTERVENTIONS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS, AND A FINAL FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION CONSTITUTED SITES FOR CO-CREATION OF KNOWLEDGE. PARTICIPANTS’ ANSWERS TO STANDARDISED QUESTIONNAIRES AND STATEMENTS DURING DIALOGUE CAFÉ MEETINGS WERE COLLATED INTO TABLES AND THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION WAS THEMATICALLY ANALYZED, WITH THREE THEMES IDENTIFIED: MOTIVATION FOR PROJECT ENGAGEMENT, EXPERIENCING AND UNDERSTANDING PARTICIPATION IN THE PROJECT, AND MIXED FEELINGS TOWARDS ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS AT HOME. THE PROJECT REVEALED THAT OLDER ADULTS WITH IMPAIRMENTS COULD NEVERTHELESS MEANINGFULLY CONTRIBUTE OPINIONS ABOUT THEIR NEEDS.

FURTHERMORE, STEREOTYPES AND IMAGE OF OLDER WOMEN ARE CONCEPTS MORE NEGATIVE FOR OLDER WOMEN IN COMPARISON TO OLDER MEN. THIS INCLUDES THE IDEA OF HOW TECHNOLOGY AND CYBER-TECHNOLOGY HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THE POSITIVE MOBILITY OF OLDER WOMEN RELATED TO ASPECTS SUCH AS PARTICIPATION, PERCEPTION OF LIFE AND SOCIAL AND SELF-PERCEIVED IMAGE. THIS CHAPTER AIMS TO EXPLORE SUCH DIMENSION IN SPAIN. IN ADDITION, THE CHAPTER REFERS TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES FOR FUNCTIONAL SUPPORT (E.G. TELE-CARE AND ALARM DEVICES, ELECTRIC WHEELCHAIRS, BUGGIES AND SCOOTERS). IN ANY CASE, THE MAIN USE OF DEVICES COULD BE EXPLAINED BECAUSE OLDER WOMEN MANIFEST A GREATER NEED FOR THEM AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY HAVE VITAL POSITIVE ATTITUDE AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS AN “IKIGAI” (ORIENTAL CONCEPT REFERRING TO THESE CONCEPTS) MORE POSITIVE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS. ALL OF THIS JUSTIFIES THE UNMET DEMAND FOR TECHNOLOGY AND DEVICES USED TO SUPPORT OLDER PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY WOMEN.

THE INPUT OF THE ERT COMPRISED 39 PROPOSITIONS FROM 20 EXPERTS REPRESENTING 11 DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. THE TWO-DAY ERT DISCUSSED THE MAIN DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES AS WELL AS VULNERABILITIES OR UNSEENS AND PROVIDED SUGGESTIONS FOR: (I) THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING MAJOR UNSEENS; (II) UNDERSTANDING POSSIBLE WAYS IN WHICH REBOUND EFFECTS OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MAY BECOME THE SUBJECT OF OVERARCHING RESEARCH IN THREE MAIN CATEGORIES OF IMPACT: DEVELOPMENT FACTORS, SOCIETY, AND INDIVIDUALS; AND (III) A SET OF POTENTIAL ACTION DOMAINS FOR TRANSDISCIPLINARY FOLLOW-UP PROCESSES, INCLUDING A CASE STUDY IN BRAZIL. A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSITIONS AND RELATED MECHANISMS PROVIDED INSIGHTS IN THE GENESIS OF UNSEENS BY IDENTIFYING 15 INTERRELATED CAUSAL MECHANISMS RELATED TO CRITICAL ISSUES/CONCERNS. ADDITIONALLY, A CLUSTER ANALYSIS (CLA) WAS APPLIED TO STRUCTURE THE CHALLENGES AND CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTH AMERICA. THE DISCUSSION ELABORATED THE GENESIS, DYNAMICS, AND IMPACTS OF (GROUPS OF) UNSEENS SUCH AS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE (THAT AFFECTS MOST COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT, PRODUCTION, ETC. TOOLS) OR THE CHALLENGE OF RESTRUCTURING SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (WHOSE SERVICE IS DIGITALLY SUBSTITUTED BY DIGITAL DEVICES). WE IDENTIFY SPECIFIC ISSUES AND EFFECTS (FOR MOST SOUTH AMERICAN COUNTRIES) SUCH AS LACK OF GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE, CHALLENGING GEOGRAPHICAL STRUCTURES (E.G., INCLUSION IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION POWER), OR THE DIGITAL READINESS OF (WIDE PARTS) OF SOCIETY. ONE SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION OF THE PAPER IS RELATED TO THE PRESENTED METHODOLOGY THAT PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE PHENOMENA, THE CAUSAL CHAINS UNDERLYING “WANTED/POSITIVE” AND “UNWANTED/NEGATIVE” EFFECTS, AND THE PROCESSES AND MECHANISMS OF SOCIETAL CHANGES CAUSED BY DIGITALIZATION.","DANUBE UNIVERSITY KREMS, AUSTRIA;FUNDAÇÃO GETULIO VARGAS, BRAZIL;UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL SUR, ARGENTINA;NATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, ARGENTINA;UNIVERSIDAD EAN, COLOMBIA;UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL DEL SUR, ARGENTINA;UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA, AUSTRIA;FUNDAÇÃO GETULIO VARGAS, BRAZIL;FUNDAÇÃO GETULIO VARGAS, BRAZIL;PONTIFÍCIA UNIVERSIDADE CATÓLICA DO PARANÁ, BRAZIL;UNIVERSIDADE DE SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL;CORREGEDORIA REGIONAL DA POLÍCIA FEDERAL NO ESTADO DO PARANÁ, 82640-040 CURITIBA, BRAZIL;, FLUVIO.GARCIA@PUCPR.BR, BRAZIL;FUNDAÇÃO GETULIO VARGAS, BRAZIL;PONTIFICAL CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL;UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, UNITED KINGDOM;PONTIFÍCIA UNIVERSIDADE CATÓLICA DO PARANÁ, BRAZIL;PONTIFÍCIA UNIVERSIDADE CATÓLICA DO PARANÁ, BRAZIL;CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY OF THE NORTH, CHILE;PONTIFÍCIA UNIVERSIDADE CATÓLICA DO PARANÁ, BRAZIL;CENTRO UNIVERSITÁRIO SÃO CAMILO, BRAZIL;DANUBE UNIVERSITY KREMS, AUSTRIA","DANUBE UNIVERSITY KREMS,AUSTRIA","CHESÑEVAR C, 2009, DOI 10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_20;

WHILE THE LITERATURE DEMONSTRATES A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH PUSH OR ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO SPEND MORE TIME ONLINE, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT PULL OR ATTRACT INDIVIDUALS ONLINE. ALTHOUGH WE KNOW THAT INDIVIDUALS USE THE INTERNET TO ACCESS INFORMATION, WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER SUCH ATTRACTION FORCES ARE RELEVANT AT THE LOCAL SCALE TOO. GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SUCH MECHANISMS WORK AT THE LOCAL SCALE CAN ASSIST OUR EFFORTS TO BRIDGE DIGITAL DIVIDES, WHICH TEND TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY CLUSTERED. TO EXPLORE THIS WE UTILISE INNOVATIVE DATA, WHICH CONTAIN ALL THE ARCHIVED WEBPAGES UNDER THE UK TOP LEVEL DOMAIN NAME (.UK) AND WE CALCULATE THE VOLUME OF INTERNET CONTENT OF LOCAL INTEREST AT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD LEVEL USING THE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE TEXT OF THESE WEBPAGES. SPECIFICALLY, WE CALCULATE THE RADIUS OF GYRATION FOR EVERY ARCHIVED WEBSITE USING THE DIFFERENT POSTCODES INCLUDED IN THE ARCHIVED WEBPAGES AND THEN WE CREATE AN AGGREGATED MEASURE AT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD LEVEL DISCOUNTING WEBSITES THAT HAVE LESS OF A LOCAL FOCUS. WE MERGE THIS MEASURE OF LOCAL INTERNET CONTENT (LIC) WITH A LARGE POPULATION SURVEY, WHICH CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF INTERNET USAGE IN THE UK AND ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF LIC ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN INDIVIDUAL BEING A FREQUENT INTERNET USER. MULTILEVEL MODELS ARE EMPLOYED TO UTILISE BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL LEVEL CHARACTERISTICS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS STUDIES AFFECT INTERNET USAGE, THE AVAILABILITY OF INTERNET CONTENT OF LOCAL INTEREST STILL ATTRACTS INDIVIDUALS ONLINE.","UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM;THE ALAN TURING INSTITUTE, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL,UNITED KINGDOM","FARAG S, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2006.02.003; OUGHTON E, 2015, DOI 10.1186/s40551-015-0006-7; SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; THELWALL M, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.lisr.2003.12.009; HALE S, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2615569.2615691; LI Y, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2016.01.002; GRAHAM M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/2043820613513121; HOFFMANN C, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.991343; GRUBESIC T, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2008.01.001; KRAUT R, 1996, DOI 10.1145/238386.238531; GRAHAM M, 2014, DOI 10.1162/inov_a_00212; VAN DEURSEN A, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; HINDMAN D, 2000, DOI 10.1177/107769900007700306; PAPAGIANNIDIS S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2015.04.011; AINSWORTH S, 2011, DOI 10.1145/1998076.1998100; MUSSO M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444816643791; BEKKERMAN A, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.jue.2013.03.009; ZILLIEN N, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2009.00617.x; GRAHAM M, 2015, DOI 10.1002/geo2.8; CALENDA D, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13691180802158508; WHEELER D, 1999, DOI 10.1111/0033-0124.00169; MILLS B, 2003, DOI 10.1111/1468-2257.00215; HUNDT C, 2014, DOI 10.1111/pirs.12133; SPARKS C, 2013, DOI 10.1080/13183222.2013.11009113; NARDOTTO M, 2015, DOI 10.1111/jeea.12127; FUCHS C, 2010, DOI 10.3390/fi2010041; SINAI T, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.jue.2004.04.001; MACK E, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.infoecopol.2009.08.001; MALECKI E, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1944-8287.2002.tb00193.x; HOLZMANN H, 2016, DOI 10.1145/2910896.2910901; GRAHAM M, 2015, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2015.1072791; ARORA S, 2013, DOI 10.1007/s11192-013-0950-7; BLANK G, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.889189; SHAPIRA P, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s11051-016-3572-1; BAKKE K, 2009, DOI 10.1080/00045600903260622; GÖK A, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s11192-014-1434-0; RIDDLESDEN D, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.04.008; LONGLEY P, 2009, DOI 10.1080/13658810701704652; LONGLEY P, 2008, DOI 10.1068/a3912; HAKLAY M, 2013, DOI 10.1068/a45184; KING G, 2001, DOI 10.1093/oxfordjournals.pan.a004868; DI GENNARO C, 2006, DOI 10.1093/pa/gsl004; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1177/0894439308321628; GRAHAM M, 2011, DOI 10.1177/146499341001100303; AGARWAL R, 2009, DOI 10.1287/isre.1080.0194; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; VIARD V, 2015, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.2013.1875; MALECKI E, 2002, DOI 10.2307/4140796; LOO B, 2017, DOI 10.1080/24694452.2016.1271306; BLANK G, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0894439317693332; BLAZQUEZ D, 2017, DOI 10.3846/20294913.2016.1213193; PAPAGIANNIDIS S, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.cor.2017.06.010; LÓPEZ-BAZO E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/00343404.2017.1331296; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812",13,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; APPLIED COMPUTING,PUB.1121091678,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL;THE ALAN TURING INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM,UNIVERSITY OF BRISTOL,NA,"TRANOS E, 2020, COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS","TRANOS E, 2020, COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS",UNITED KINGDOM; UNITED KINGDOM; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.101371,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1121091678,NA,NA,NA,"JISC,ESRC,BRISTOL,UNITED KINGDOM;ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL,ESRC,SWINDON,UNITED KINGDOM",DIM

BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS A PEER-TO-PEER PROTOCOL THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO KEEP TRACK OF TRANSACTIONS OVER THE INTERNET. PUBLICIZED FOR ITS USE IN THE BITCOIN REVOLUTION, THE TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES TRANSPARENCY AND TRACEABILITY THAT CAN BE USED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF LAND RIGHTS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORMALIZATION OF LAND RIGHTS, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY PROMISES TO AUTHENTICATE OWNERS AND OTHER USERS OF LAND, AND PROVIDES A FIXED LEDGER OF LAND USE RIGHTS TRANSACTIONS. AT PRESENT, BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY IS BEING EXPLORED AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES TO TRACK LAND TITLES (STATE TO INDIVIDUAL). WE EXTEND THE IDEA TO CAPTURE THE GRANTING OF LAND USE RIGHTS (INDIVIDUAL TO INDIVIDUAL) MAKING USE OF THE DECENTRALIZATION, PEER-TO-PEER NATURE OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY. WHILE THE TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A PANACEA TO ALL LAND ADMINISTRATION CHALLENGES, IT CAN OFFER AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO MANAGE LAND TRANSACTIONS, PROVIDE DIGITAL DOCUMENTATION TO ACTORS IN THE INFORMAL LAND RENTAL MARKET AND REDUCE INEFFICIENCY IN LAND SYSTEMS.

WITH THIS CAME AN INFLUX OF PRODUCTS THAT DEPEND ON NETWORK EFFECTS AND THRIVE IN A WINNER-TAKES-ALL MARKET ENVIRONMENT (SCHILLING 2002). A SIMILAR TREND IS BEING OBSERVED IN MANY FRONTIER TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING APPLICATIONS IN THE SO-CALLED ‘GIG ECONOMY’, WHICH WILL CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS. SIMULTANEOUSLY, GOVERNMENTS ARE EXPERIENCING AN EROSION OF THEIR TAX BASE (PENG 2016). THESE RESOURCES ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED TO TACKLE THE WIDENING DIGITAL DIVIDE, COMBATTING THE LACK OF ELECTRICITY, AND PROVIDING INTERNET ACCESS TO THE POOREST (INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY 2017). THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF THE UNITED NATIONS (UN) SHOWS PROMISE. HOWEVER, THE WAY THE UN CURRENTLY OPERATES HAS NOT BEEN ADAPTED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A DIGITAL ECONOMY. THIS IS OFTEN OBSERVED IN GLOBAL-TO-LOCAL APPLICATIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN GENERALIZED FRAMEWORKS FAIL TO ADAPT TO COMMUNITIES WITH DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS AND NEEDS. THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) ARE A GUIDING LIGHT TO RALLY STAKEHOLDERS AROUND SPECIFIC KEY ISSUES AND OPENS THE FIELD FOR COLLABORATION. THE UN IS IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO CONVINCE ALL PARTICIPANTS TO ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS, TO MOBILIZE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES, AND HAS THE BEST CHANCE TO GET CONCESSIONS ON RESTRICTIVE SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARRANGEMENTS (HAUGEN 2010). SYSTEMS NEED TO BE IN PLACE TO FACILITATE TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS AND CAPACITIES NEED TO BE BUILT UP TO GIVE THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES (LDCS) A CHANCE OF CATCHING UP. THE UN NEEDS TO BRING INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, GOVERNMENTS, CIVIL SOCIETY, ACADEMIA, AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO THE TABLE TO ENABLE LDCS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURE (MOYO 2010). THE UN SHOULD INTRODUCE MORE HEURISTIC ANALYSIS TOOLS TO BRING MORE DIVERSE PARTNERS INTO WORKABLE COLLABORATIONS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. A NEW LEADERSHIP SYSTEM SHOULD ALSO BE INTRODUCED TO PROVIDE CLEARER DIRECTION AND AUTONOMY TO THEIR CONTRIBUTORS.","UNIVERSITY OF ST.

EXISTING DEFINITIONS AND PERSPECTIVES IN THIS AREA GO BEYOND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS OR MEDIA FOR THE CREATION OF A DIGITAL LITERACY MINDSET, WHICH DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT ONE'S LIFE. HOWEVER, HIGHER EDUCATION STRATEGIES HAVE NOT YET CAUGHT UP WITH THIS AGENDA.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A STUDENT SURVEY WITH LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SCIENCE STUDENTS FROM THREE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN SCOTLAND, IRELAND AND GREECE WAS CONDUCTED AS A BASIS OF EMPIRICAL DATA TO SUPPORT THE THEORETICAL PROPOSITIONS OF THE STUDY. THE SURVEY CENTRED ON THE TECHNICAL AND HIGHER-LEVEL DIGITAL COMPETENCES OF STUDENTS AND DRAWING FROM STUDENTS' SELF-PERCEIVED DIGITAL COMPETENCES FOR LEARNING AND FOR THE EVERYDAY LIFE DIGITAL CONTEXT, ADDRESSING E-LEISURE, E-LEARNING, E-DEMOCRACY, E-GOVERNMENT AND E-HEALTH ACTIVITIES. THE SURVEY CRITICALLY ENABLED STUDENTS TO ASSESS DIGITAL COMPETENCES FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVES AS DIGITAL PARTICIPANTS.   FINDINGS STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES WERE LACKING IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, WHICH INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMATION LITERACY, DIGITAL CREATION, DIGITAL RESEARCH AND DIGITAL IDENTITY MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, STUDENTS' DIGITAL COMPETENCES WERE FOUND TO BE LINKED TO PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITHIN THE EVERYDAY LIFE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT. THE HIGHER THE SELF-PERCEIVED DIGITAL COMPETENCE LEVELS OF STUDENTS WERE ON THE BASIS OF DEALING WITH EVERYDAY LIFE DIGITAL TASKS, THE MORE LIKELY THEY WERE TO ALSO DEVELOP HIGH SELF-PERCEIVED DIGITAL COMPETENCE IN OTHER DIGITAL AREAS RELATED TO THEIR EDUCATION.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE HIGHER EDUCATION HAS NOT FULLY EMBRACED DIGITAL COMPETENCES AS A CORE, FUNDAMENTAL LITERACY WHICH ADDRESSES BOTH TECHNOLOGY MASTERY AND A DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP MINDSET. AS EMERGING MODELS BEGIN TO CHALLENGE TRADITIONAL TEACHING AND LEARNING PARADIGMS, WITH GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY AND PERSONALISED APPROACHES, EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDES MAY BE FURTHER ACCELERATED. THIS REQUIRES REVISITING DIGITAL COMPETENCES WITH EMPHASIS ON THE DIVERSITY OF THE CONTEXTS WHERE IT DEVELOPS AND OF THE LEARNERS INVOLVED, IN THE OVERALL CONTINUUM OF LEARNING FOR LIFE.","ROBERT GORDON UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN, IRELAND;IONIAN UNIVERSITY, GREECE;IONIAN UNIVERSITY, GREECE","ROBERT GORDON UNIVERSITY,UNITED KINGDOM","BAWDEN D, 2001, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000007083; BALOG K, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-14136-7_69; BENNETT S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x; HOLLANDSWORTH R, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s11528-011-0510-z; GROSS M, 2011, DOI 10.1002/asi.21681; BROWN G, 2015, DOI 10.1080/0969594x.2014.996523; BAWDEN D, 2002, DOI 10.1087/095315102760319279; KNIGHT C, 2012, DOI 10.1080/13562517.2012.666734; BLANCH-HARTIGAN D, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.pec.2010.06.037; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; ELDER G, 2003, DOI 10.1007/978-0-306-48247-2_1; CALLINAN J, 2005, DOI 10.1108/00242530510583039; NG W, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.016; ROWLANDS I, 2008, DOI 10.1108/00012530810887953; PREBENSEN N, 2016, DOI 10.1108/ijchm-02-2014-0073; ESPINOZA L, 2014, DOI 10.1080/02602938.2014.966053; DU J, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.acalib.2011.04.003; BULFIN S, 2012, DOI 10.1080/09500782.2012.691515; MACDONALD J, 2001, DOI 10.1111/1467-8535.00211; POROPAT A, 2009, DOI 10.1037/a0014996; CULLEN R, 2011, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-1842.2011.00933.x; HELMS-PARK R, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.iheduc.2006.10.002; TORNEY‐PURTA J, 2015, DOI 10.1002/ets2.12081; MARTZOUKOU K, 2008, DOI 10.1515/libr.2008.019; CATALANO A, 2013, DOI 10.1108/00220411311300066; KRUGER J, 1999, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121; MCDOWELL L, 2002, DOI 10.1111/1467-8535.00261; BROWN C, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00735.x; LIU Z, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.ipm.2004.12.002; MARGARYAN A, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2010.09.004; HOLBROOK M, 1982, DOI 10.1086/208906; ALTINAY GAZI Z, 2016, DOI 10.15390/eb.2016.4533; WHITE D, 2011, DOI 10.5210/fm.v16i9.3171; MITTERMEYER D, 2005, DOI 10.3233/efi-2005-23401; MARTZOUKOU K, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jd-07-2016-0094; GKOREZIS P, 2017, DOI 10.1108/lm-02-2017-0021; MCGREW S, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00933104.2017.1416320; LOOMIS D, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00222216.2018.1494418; SPANTE M, 2018, DOI 10.1080/2331186x.2018.1519143; GIBSON P, 2018, DOI 10.1108/ils-07-2018-0059; CIARDO A, 2019, DOI 10.1111/eje.12422; MCGUINNESS C, 2019, DOI 10.28945/4190; BLOSSFELD H, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-658-23162-0_2; HUANG Y, 2019, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2019.1647665; FULTON C, 2020, DOI 10.1080/13614533.2020.1765818",30,2020,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1128890095,ISI,ROBERT GORDON UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE DUBLIN;IONIAN UNIVERSITY;IONIAN UNIVERSITY,ROBERT GORDON UNIVERSITY,NA,"MARTZOUKOU K, 2020, JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION","MARTZOUKOU K, 2020, JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION",UNITED KINGDOM; IRELAND; GREECE,10.1108/jd-03-2020-0041,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1128890095,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

DOES GREATER INFORMATION ABOUT COVID-19 VACCINE RELIABILITY FACILITATE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION? TO GAUGE THE COVID-19 RELATED INFORMATION ON THE WORLD-WIDE-WEB WE CREATED TWO CROSS-STATE DATASETS USING GOOGLE SEARCH. ONE SEARCH DEALT WITH SEARCHING FOR INFORMATION ON VACCINATION AVAILABILITY AND SCHEDULING IN EACH STATE, WHILE THE OTHER SEARCH INVOLVED INFORMATION ON VACCINE RELIABILITY AND ITS SIDE EFFECTS. THE ESTIMATION RESULTS SHOWED THAT GREATER AVAILABILITY OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET INCREASED VACCINE ADMINISTRATION RATES, AND THIS WAS TRUE FOR BOTH TYPES OF INTERNET SEARCHES, RESULTING IN AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS ABOVE. IN CONTRAST, THE DIFFUSION OF INTERNET ACCESS AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ACROSS STATES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON VACCINATION RATES.

TO UNDERSTAND BARRIERS TO DOWNLOAD AND USER FIDELITY IN DIFFERENT SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS WE ANALYSED DATA FROM FIVE CONSECUTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL WAVES OF THE COVID-19 SNAPSHOT MONITORING SURVEY FROM JUNE TO AUGUST 2020. QUESTIONS ON THE CORONA WARN APP INCLUDED INFORMATION ON DOWNLOAD, USE, FUNCTIONALITY, USABILITY, AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE APP. OF THE 4,960 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE 45.9 YEARS, STANDARD DEVIATION 16.0, 50.4% FEMALE), 36.5% HAD DOWNLOADED THE CORONA WARN APP. ADJUSTED ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THOSE WHO HAD DOWNLOADED THE APP WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE FEMALE (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO FOR MEN 1.16 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [1.02;1.33]), LESS LIKELY TO BE YOUNGER (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO FOR AGE 18 TO 39 0.47 [0.32;0.59] ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO FOR AGE 40 TO 64 0.57 [0.46;0.69]), LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOME (AOR 0.55 [0.43;0.69]), AND MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN ONE OF THE WESTERN FEDERAL STATES INCLUDING BERLIN (AOR 2.31 [1.90;2.82]). WILLINGNESS TO DISCLOSE A POSITIVE TEST RESULT AND TRUST IN DATA PROTECTION COMPLIANCE OF THE CORONA WARN APP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN OLDER ADULTS. WILLINGNESS TO DISCLOSE ALSO INCREASED WITH HIGHER EDUCATIONAL DEGREES AND INCOME.

THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS ONE OF THE COMPETITIVENESS ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING TOURISM ORGANIZATIONS AND DESTINATIONS, AFFECTING THEIR CAPACITY TO INTERACT EFFECTIVELY IN A GLOBAL TOURISM ENVIRONMENT. GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD AS A PHENOMENON OF UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CAN LEAD TO DIGITAL AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION, AS CERTAIN GROUPS OF TOURISTS AND DESTINATIONS ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPPORTUNITIES EMERGING FROM THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ICT. IN THIS CHAPTER, WE DISCUSS THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPTUAL MODELS USED TO INTERPRET THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THE BARRIERS TO TOURISM COMPETITIVENESS IT PRESENTS FOR DIFFERENT TERRITORIAL AREAS, FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF BOTH SUPPLY AND DEMAND. GIVEN THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR TOURISM ORGANIZATIONS AND DESTINATIONS, WE REVIEW THE MAIN INDICATORS, TOOLS, AND INSTRUMENTS USED TO MEASURE THIS PHENOMENON, AS WELL AS THE STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS EMPLOYED TO MINIMIZE IT. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS NEW RESEARCH APPROACHES TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT FOCUS ON THE LINK BETWEEN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, TOURISM INEQUALITIES, AND CONNECTIVITY.","OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, SPAIN;OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA, SPAIN","OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA,SPAIN","SPENCER A, 2014, DOI 10.1108/whatt-12-2013-0047; GRETZEL U, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s12525-015-0196-8; MACKAY K, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2012.02.001; SELWYN N, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.003; RACHERLA P, 2008, DOI 10.1080/13683500802316022; FUCHS M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.jdmm.2014.08.002; GRETZEL U, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.03.043; LALICIC L, 2016, DOI 10.1080/13683500.2016.1141179; PAN B, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2006.03.006; HANNAM K, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.annals.2013.09.010; BÜCHI M, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444815604154; KANTARCI K, 2014, DOI 10.1201/b17367-13; DICKINSON J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.tourman.2016.06.005; PARIS C, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-14343-9_58; PEARCE P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/15980634.2012.11434656; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; MINGHETTI V, 2009, DOI 10.1177/0047287509346843; RAGNEDDA M, 2017, DOI 10.4324/9781315606002; TANTI A, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s40558-017-0081-8; MAURER C, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-3-7091-0503-0_22; HJALAGER A, 2012, DOI 10.1007/978-3-7091-1142-0_9; WEISS J, 2015, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2015.261; GONZÁLEZ-REVERTÉ F, 2018, DOI 10.3390/su10020413; VU H, 2018, DOI 10.1080/13683500.2018.1553151; HUERTAS A, 2018, DOI 10.6018/turismo.42.08; LAMA S, 2018, DOI 10.5130/acis2018.bq; GONZÁLEZ-REVERTÉ F, 2019, DOI 10.3390/su11236874; MAGASIC M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1468797619899343; GRETZEL U, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s40558-020-00181-3; SIGALA M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.06.015",0,2021,"TOURISM; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; COMMERCIAL SERVICES; MARKETING",PUB.1143323401,ISI,OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA;OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA,OPEN UNIVERSITY OF CATALONIA,NA,"REVERTE FG, 2021, NA","REVERTE FG, 2021, NA",SPAIN,10.1007/978-3-030-05324-6_109-1,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1143323401,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE WORKFORCE AND CONSUMERS OF DIGITAL SERVICES, WHICH LACK THE NECESSARY DIGITAL SKILLS AND PHYSICAL AND MATERIAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INTERNET, ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE NEEDS OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY. THESE PROBLEMS ARE ALSO RELEVANT FOR UKRAINE SINCE 53% OF THE UKRAINIAN POPULATION HAVE DIGITAL SKILLS BELOW THE BASIC LEVEL, 15.1% OF UKRAINIANS DO NOT HAVE SUCH SKILLS, AND 37.9% OF CITIZENS HAVE A LOW LEVEL. THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THE GROWTH OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL INEQUALITY, THE GROWTH OF INFORMATION AND CYBER THREATS, IMPLEMENTED CYBER-ATTACKS, THE LOSS OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, AND THE LIKE. CONSIDERING THE ABOVE AND THE LACK OF RESEARCH IN THIS AREA, THE SIGNIFICANT SPECIFICITY OF THE ENDOGENOUS NATURE OF CONVERGENT PROCESSES IN THE CHAIN ""EDUCATION – DIGITAL BREAKS – DIGITAL INCLUSION"", THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS RELEVANT AND HAS A PRACTICAL FOCUS. IN THEIR RESEARCH ON DIGITAL INCLUSION, THE AUTHORS BASE THEMSELVES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, WHICH IS SEEN AS INEQUALITY IN ACCESS AND USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES AND THE INTERNET. THE ARTICLE CONTAINS A LOGICAL AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND GENERALIZATION OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON THE CONCEPTS OF DIGITAL INEQUALITY AND SYSTEMATIZATION OF ITS LEVELS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECIFICS AND FACTORS OF INFLUENCE. EXPLORE THE LEVELS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN DESCRIPTORS OF ACCESS (FIRST LEVEL OF DIGITAL DIVIDE), DIGITAL SKILLS AND DIGITAL COMPETENCIES REQUIRED TO USE THE INTERNET COMPETENTLY (SECOND LEVEL OF DIGITAL DIVIDE), INEQUALITIES IN THE CAPACITIES TO GET THE BENEFITS FROM THE ACCESS, AND USE OF THE INTERNET (THIRD LEVEL OF DIGITAL DIVIDE), AND LEARNING DIVIDE (FOURTH LEVEL OF DIGITAL DIVIDE). FOR EACH LEVEL OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, THE ROLE OF EDUCATION AS A DETERMINANT OF OVERCOMING IT IS EXAMINED.","SUMY STATE UNIVERSITY, UKRAINE","SUMY STATE UNIVERSITY,UKRAINE","WARSCHAUER M, 2003, DOI 10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN DEURSEN A, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; MADON S, 2009, DOI 10.1002/itdj.20108; NYLAND N, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1941126x.2015.1029789; JAEGER P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2012.654728; MERVYN K, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2013.877952; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s2050-206020150000010002; SHARMA R, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.telpol.2016.05.003; NEUMANN M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10643-016-0792-z; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; DOBSON T, 2009, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511609664.017; SCHEERDER A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.07.007; ESHET-ALKALAI Y, 2012, DOI 10.28945/1621; NORRIS P, 2001, DOI 10.1017/cbo9781139164887; YU B, 2018, DOI 10.1108/jd-10-2017-0148; VAN DEURSEN A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/poi3.171; SZELES M, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11205-020-02287-x; ALI M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2020.101405; RAMSETTY A, 2020, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocaa078; REISDORF B, 2020, DOI 10.17645/si.v8i2.3184; ASLAM A, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s11135-020-01008-3; AZIZ A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/09584935.2020.1793912; LAI J, 2020, DOI 10.1002/aepp.13104; ALHASSAN M, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101511; BUCKINGHAM D, 2015, DOI 10.18261/issn1891-943x-2015-jubileumsnummer-03; MIROSHNICHENKO I, 2021, DOI 10.2991/aebmr.k.210210.065",0,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1142798137,ISI,SUMY STATE UNIVERSITY,SUMY STATE UNIVERSITY,NA,"KRYKLII O, 2021, SCIENTIFIC OPINION ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT","KRYKLII O, 2021, SCIENTIFIC OPINION ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT",UKRAINE,10.32836/2521-666x/2021-75-5,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1142798137,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

FIRSTLY, THE ADOPTION OF ADVANTAGEOUS INTERNET USES IS STRONGLY RELATED TO INTERNET USERS’ MATERIAL AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES. THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF THESE RESOURCES, THE HIGHER THE PROBABILITY THAT ADVANTAGEOUS INTERNET USES WILL BE ADOPTED. SECONDLY, INTERNET USERS’ OFFLINE RESOURCES HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THEIR DIGITAL SKILLS. ON THE OTHER HAND, AND ACCORDING TO THE THIRD LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE, ADVANTAGEOUS INTERNET USE IN NOT BENEFICIAL PER SE.

EVEN THOUGH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS STILL TOO IMMATURE TO SUPPORT SATISFACTORY USER EXPERIENCE IN MANY MASS MARKET DOMAINS, CONVERSATIONAL INTERFACES HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO AD HOC APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CALL CENTRES AND ONLINE SHOPPING ASSISTANTS. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN APPLIED SO FAR TO SOCIAL INCLUSION OF ELDERLY PEOPLE, WHO ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. MANY OF THEM RELIEVE THEIR LONELINESS WITH TRADITIONAL MEDIA SUCH AS TV AND RADIO, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO CREATE A FEELING OF COMPANIONSHIP. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT THE EBER CHATBOT, DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL GAP FOR THE ELDERLY. EBER READS NEWS IN THE BACKGROUND AND ADAPTS ITS RESPONSES TO THE USER’S MOOD. ITS NOVELTY LIES IN THE CONCEPT OF “INTELLIGENT RADIO”, ACCORDING TO WHICH, INSTEAD OF SIMPLIFYING A DIGITAL INFORMATION SYSTEM TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO THE ELDERLY, A TRADITIONAL CHANNEL THEY FIND FAMILIAR -BACKGROUND NEWS- IS AUGMENTED WITH INTERACTIONS VIA VOICE DIALOGUES. WE MAKE IT POSSIBLE BY COMBINING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELLING LANGUAGE, AUTOMATIC NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATION AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS. THE SYSTEM ALLOWS ACCESSING DIGITAL CONTENT OF INTEREST BY COMBINING WORDS EXTRACTED FROM USER ANSWERS TO CHATBOT QUESTIONS WITH KEYWORDS EXTRACTED FROM THE NEWS ITEMS. THIS APPROACH PERMITS DEFINING METRICS OF THE ABSTRACTION CAPABILITIES OF THE USERS DEPENDING ON A SPATIAL REPRESENTATION OF THE WORD SPACE. TO PROVE THE SUITABILITY OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION WE PRESENT RESULTS OF REAL EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED WITH ELDERLY PEOPLE THAT PROVIDED VALUABLE INSIGHTS. OUR APPROACH WAS CONSIDERED SATISFACTORY DURING THE TESTS AND IMPROVED THE INFORMATION SEARCH CAPABILITIES OF THE PARTICIPANTS.","UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO, SPAIN","UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO,SPAIN","NGUYEN T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.07.052; JOHNSON D, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s12369-015-0331-x; WANG H, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.specom.2009.03.006; SHARKEY A, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10676-010-9234-6; FAVELA J, 2015, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-18323-7_11; OSTLUND B, 2009, DOI 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2009.00711.x; ZHOU H, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.neucom.2016.07.036; ANDREWS P, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2209310.2209315; ROBINS B, 2005, DOI 10.1007/s10209-005-0116-3; KENNY P, 2008, DOI 10.1145/1389586.1389594; CALIGIURI P, 2002, DOI 10.1080/09585190210125903; JENKINS M, 2007, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-73110-8_9; PRANSKY J, 2001, DOI 10.1108/01439910110380406; DÍAZ-BOSSINI J, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2014.02.008; HILL J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.02.026; CZAJA S, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s10209-006-0060-x; SALICHS M, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s12369-015-0319-6; CAMBRIA E, 2016, DOI 10.1109/mis.2016.31; CILIBRASI R, 2007, DOI 10.1109/tkde.2007.48; ABUSHAWAR B, 2015, DOI 10.13053/cys-19-4-2326; KUMAR V, 2016, DOI 10.18535/ijecs/v5i3.28; YASUDA K, 2014, DOI 10.4017/gt.2014.13.02.239.00; FAISALMOHAMEDYUSOF M, 2014, DOI 10.5120/16576-6261; XU A, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3025453.3025496; ELIACIK A, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2017.10.006; BUDIHARTO W, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2017.10.064; KIRILENKO A, 2017, DOI 10.1177/0047287517729757; BLAAKILDE A, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1367549417708437; NOH S, 2017, DOI 10.1109/isuvr.2017.10; AUGELLO A, 2008, DOI 10.1109/cisis.2008.117; THOMAS N, 2016, DOI 10.1109/icacci.2016.7732476; MATSUMOTO R, 2007, DOI 10.1109/iros.2007.4399598; MAHAPATRA R, 2012, DOI 10.1109/conseg.2012.6349510; CORREIA F, 2016, DOI 10.1109/hri.2016.7451857; OH K, 2017, DOI 10.1109/mdm.2017.64; AALTONEN I, 2017, DOI 10.1145/3029798.3038362; REITER E, 2000, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511519857; WEN T, 2015, DOI 10.18653/v1/d15-1199; JUNCAL-MARTÍNEZ J, 2016, DOI 10.18653/v1/s16-1016; BABY C, 2017, DOI 10.1109/ipact.2017.8245185; SU M, 2017, DOI 10.1109/icot.2017.8336091; POECZE F, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.procs.2018.04.117; FLEMING A, 2018, DOI 10.1057/s41599-018-0107-7; GARCÍA-MÉNDEZ S, 2018, DOI 10.1145/3192714.3192837; MARTIN-GUTIERREZ S, 2018, DOI 10.1109/asonam.2018.8508386; LIU W, 2018, DOI 10.1109/icsse.2018.8520008; GARCÍA-MÉNDEZ S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2018.11.036; PEREIRA J, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10916-019-1237-1; SKJUVE M, 2019, DOI 10.17011/ht/urn.201902201607; CHAURASIYA R, 2018, DOI 10.1109/icraie.2018.8710414; SOHRABI M, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s11042-019-7586-4; GARCÍA-MÉNDEZ S, 2019, DOI 10.1109/access.2019.2937505; REN X, 2020, DOI 10.1109/access.2020.3005733; CARLANDER-REUTERFELT D, 2020, DOI 10.1109/access.2020.3024795",9,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PUB.1138114647,ISI,UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO;UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO,UNIVERSIDADE DE VIGO,NA,"GARCÍA-MÉNDEZ S, 2021, IEEE ACCESS","GARCÍA-MÉNDEZ S, 2021, IEEE ACCESS",SPAIN,10.1109/access.2021.3080837,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1138114647,NA,NA,NA,"MINISTRY OF ECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVENESS,MINECO,MADRID,SPAIN",DIM

CONSEQUENTLY, THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE BIM DIVIDE FROM A MULTIFACETED PERSPECTIVE AND EVALUATES ITS CONTEXTUALITY VIA FIRMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES. IT MOBILIZES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MODEL FROM THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DISCIPLINE. THE CONTEXTUALIZED MODEL DEPICTS THE BIM DIVIDE THROUGH FOUR CATEGORIES OF MOTIVATIONAL, PHYSICAL, SKILLS, AND USAGE ACCESS. THE MODEL WAS EMPIRICALLY TESTED THROUGH THE GENERALIZED STRUCTURED COMPONENT ANALYSIS (GSCA) WITH DATA FROM AN INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY. THE FINDINGS UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO RETHINK BIM ADOPTION AS A MULTIFACETED AND DYNAMIC PROCESS AGAINST THE EXTANT STATIC TWO-TIERED REPRESENTATION.

NEVERTHELESS, USER-REPORTERS HAVE CONTINUED TO FAVOR EARLIER IMPLEMENTED CHANNELS INCLUDING TRADITIONAL (E.G., PHONE, OFFICE) AND E-GOVERNMENT CHANNELS (E.G., WEB, EMAIL) OVER NEW DIGITAL CHANNELS SUCH AS M-GOVERNMENT CHANNELS (E.G., MOBILE APPLICATIONS). DRAWING ON CHANNEL CHOICE LITERATURE AND THEORIES, THIS STUDY AIMS AT EXPLAINING USERS' REPORTING BEHAVIOR BY EXAMINING THE ROLE OF USERS' PERSONAL FACTORS, INCLUDING DIGITAL DIVIDE DETERMINANTS, USERS' SERVICE EXPERIENCE, AND CHANNEL SATISFACTION. WE USE A COMBINATION OF SURVEY AND LOG DATA ON ACTUAL REPORTING BEHAVIOR AMONG SMART BIKE-SHARING USERS TO EXPLAIN USERS' CHANNEL CHOICE. USING A MULTINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION, WE FOUND THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE PREDICTS USER-REPORTERS' CHANNEL CHOICE. MOREOVER, USER-REPORTERS WITH A LONGER SERVICE MEMBERSHIP FAVOR TRADITIONAL AND E-GOVERNMENT CHANNELS, OVER THE NEWLY IMPLEMENTED M-GOVERNMENT CHANNELS. FINALLY, USER-REPORTERS' SATISFACTION WITH THE MOBILE APPLICATION IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE USER-REPORTERS' CHOICE OF TRADITIONAL AND E-GOVERNMENT CHANNELS.

THE LATTER IS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE DISTANCES TO INTERNET ACCESS POINTS, UNDERDEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURE, SPARSE POPULATIONS, AND LOW INCOMES. THIS CONCERN OF DIGITAL DIVIDE IS RAISED IN THE SIXTH GENERATION’S (6G) INITIAL VISION AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOPIC. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AFFILIATED CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION. MOTIVATED BY THE RECENT BACKHAUL LINK FORECASTS THAT EXPECT A DOMINANCE OF THE MICROWAVE TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE BACKHAULING MARKET, THIS PAPER STUDIES THE POTENTIAL OF A LOW-POWER TERRESTRIAL MICROWAVE BACKHAUL FROM THE SUFFICIENT-DATA-RATE AND SOLAR POWERING PERSPECTIVE. COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES (E.G., FIBER) MAY NOT BE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND COMMERCIALLY VIABLE FOR GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY. SINCE RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS MAY NOT HAVE GRID POWER, WE LOOK AT THE VIABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SUSTAINABLE SOURCES, IN PARTICULAR SOLAR POWER, TO POWER THE WIRELESS BACKHAUL IN 6G.

THERE IS ALSO A DISCUSSION OF POLICY PRIORITIES TO ENHANCE THE POSITIVE EFFECTS AND LIMIT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DIGITALIZATION. SYSTEMATIC AND COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS METHODS WERE USED. THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS ARE THAT EARLY RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ON ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS FAILED TO FULLY EXPLAIN THE SUSTAINED CORRELATION BETWEEN DIGITALIZATION AND PRODUCTIVITY, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF AVAILABLE STATISTICS IN THE PAST. RECENT STUDIES LARGELY SUGGEST THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH CHANNELS SUCH AS ROBOTICS THAT INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY ON ASSEMBLY LINES, AUTONOMOUS MACHINES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS THAT INCREASE DATA ANALYSIS AND OPERATIONS PRODUCTIVITY, AUTOMATED MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING THAT INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY BY REDUCING DOWNTIME DUE TO BREAKDOWNS, 3-D PRINTING TECHNOLOGY THAT INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH RAPID PRODUCTION OF PARTS, REDUCING THE SUPPLY CHAIN, INNOVATIVE MATERIALS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND PROCESSING TIME, INFORMATICS THAT REDUCE COSTS AND REANALYSIS TIME. IT IS ARGUED THAT, IN REALITY, THESE CHANNELS MAY HAVE MUCH LESS IMPACT ON PRODUCTIVITY THAN THEIR POTENTIAL, DUE TO A NUMBER OF MARKET CHARACTERISTICS AND POLICY CONSTRAINTS. THE PHENOMENON OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE INCLUDES UNEQUAL INCOME DISTRIBUTION, UNEQUAL ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY, AND RISKS OF INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT, ETC. THUS, EFFECTIVE, COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES TO PROMOTE DIGITALIZATION AT VARIOUS LEVELS CAN HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GOALS OF THE NATION. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" AS FOLLOWS: IMPROVING SKILLS AND TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE, PROVIDING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET IN RURAL AND REMOTE AREAS, REDISTRIBUTION OF LABOR AND CAPITAL, COMPETITION POLICY TOOLS IN CASE OF A LARGE INFLUENCE OF PLATFORM BUSINESS ON MARKETS, REDUCING FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS FOR YOUNG INNOVATIVE FIRMS AND START-UPS, TRANSITION TO PUBLIC DIGITAL SERVICES, DIGITAL-FRIENDLY POLICY FOR THE ELDERLY POPULATION.","LVIV UNIVERSITY, UKRAINE;LVIV UNIVERSITY, UKRAINE","LVIV UNIVERSITY,UKRAINE","PILAT D, 2005, DOI 10.1787/eco_studies-v2004-art3-en; COLECCHIA A, 2003, DOI 10.1787/eco_studies-v2002-art5-en; BRYNJOLFSSON E, 2011, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1819486; SCHREYER P, 2000, DOI 10.1787/151634666253; SORBE S, 2019, DOI 10.1787/273176bc-en; MOSKALYK R, 2015, DOI 10.30970/vir.2015.36-1.1.108; RIVARES A, 2019, DOI 10.1787/080a17ce-en",1,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING; ENGINEERING,PUB.1145743496,ISI,LVIV UNIVERSITY;LVIV UNIVERSITY,LVIV UNIVERSITY,NA,"MOSKALYK R, 2021, GREEN BLUE AND DIGITAL ECONOMY JOURNAL","MOSKALYK R, 2021, GREEN BLUE AND DIGITAL ECONOMY JOURNAL",UKRAINE,10.30525/2661-5169/2021-3-4,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1145743496,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

PRIOR RESEARCH ON ELECTRONIC INCLUSION AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS MAINLY CONSIDERED TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CONCERNS, SUCH AS INTERNET ANXIETY, PREVENTING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FROM USING DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES. YET, THESE CONCERNS MAY INSUFFICIENTLY ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES MAY SUSPECT THAT GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE NEW SERVICES ONLY TO REDUCE COSTS AND FORGO THE NEED FOR MORE MEANINGFUL SOCIAL CHANGE. THEREFORE, WE DRAW FROM STIGMA POWER THEORY TO UNDERSTAND HOW PERCEPTIONS OF STEREOTYPING AND DISCRIMINATION CONTRIBUTE TO THE AVOIDANCE OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AMONG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT OVERCOMING UNDERUTILIZATION OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES AMONG PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES REQUIRES A HOLISTIC APPROACH BY ADDRESSING TECHNOLOGY-RELATED AS WELL AS STIGMA-RELATED CONCERNS.","UNIVERSITY OF MANNHEIM, GERMANY;EBS UNIVERSITY OF BUSINESS AND LAW, GERMANY;UNIVERSITY OF MANNHEIM, GERMANY;EBS UNIVERSITY OF BUSINESS AND LAW, GERMANY","UNIVERSITY OF MANNHEIM,GERMANY","BROWN R, 2003, DOI 10.1016/s0022-1031(03)00039-8;

MANAGERS NOT ONLY SOLVE THE USUAL TASKS, BUT ALSO FACE  THE PROBLEM OF THE NEED TO CHANGE THE USUAL LEADERSHIP STYLE: PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS ARE REPLACING DIRECTIVE  MANAGEMENT METHODS. THE EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE MANAGER IS ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED, WHICH MEANS THE  ABILITY TO OBSERVE AND BE AWARE OF THEIR OWN EXPERIENCES AND EMOTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE, MANAGE THEIR OWN FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS OF ANOTHER, AND BUILD INTERACTION ON THIS BASIS.

ROBOTIZATION AND DIGITALIZATION PREVENT SOME TRADITIONALLY  ARISING CONFLICTS, BUT NEW CONFLICTS RELATED TO THE VIRTUAL NATURE OF WORK ALSO ARISE IN ORGANIZATIONS: THE RIGIDITY AND UNAMBIGUITY OF VERBAL MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, PROVOKING CONFLICT; THE CONFLICT CAUSED BY THE REDUCTION  OF JOBS IN THE ORGANIZATION; THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, WHICH CONSISTS IN DIFFERENCES IN DIGITAL LITERACY AND DIGITAL COMPETENCE OF THE YOUNGER AND OLDER GENERATIONS OF EMPLOYEES.","STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT, RUSSIA","STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT,RUSSIA","MARTÍNEZ-MORENO E, 2012, DOI 10.1037/a0029569; SALOVEY P, 1990, DOI 10.2190/dugg-p24e-52wk-6cdg",1,2021,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1140283796,ISI,STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT,STATE UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT,NA,"YUROVITSKY SY, 2021, VESTNIK UNIVERSITETA","YUROVITSKY SY, 2021, VESTNIK UNIVERSITETA",RUSSIA,10.26425/1816-4277-2021-6-177-182,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1140283796,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

FAILURES IN IMPLEMENTING E-GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS SUGGEST THE LACK OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH IN UNDERSTANDING E-GOVERNMENT AS A DISCIPLINE. IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT AN OVERARCHING AND INTEGRATED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF E-GOVERNMENT GROUNDED IN ROBUST QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TO DESCRIBE THE FACTORS THAT MUST BE INTEGRATED TO IMPLEMENT E-GOVERNMENT SUCCESSFULLY. DRAWING INSIGHTS FROM 168 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN INDIA, THIS STUDY DEFINES E-GOVERNMENT AS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCT WITH CUSTOMER ORIENTATION, CHANNEL ORIENTATION AND TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION AS ITS ANTECEDENTS. BUILDING ON CUSTOMER ORIENTATION AND RELATIONSHIP MARKETING THEORIES, THIS STUDY PROPOSES THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IMPACTING SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTING E-GOVERNMENT PROJECTS IS CITIZEN ORIENTATION, FOLLOWED BY CHANNEL ORIENTATION AND TECHNOLOGY ORIENTATION. THE STUDY ALSO IDENTIFIES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY AS MODERATORS OF E-GOVERNMENT. FURTHERMORE, THE STUDY PROPOSES THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE OUTCOMES OF E-GOVERNMENT WITH PERCEIVED PRIVACY AND SHARED UNDERSTANDING AS MODERATING CONDITIONS.

DESPITE TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATING THROUGH SOCIETY, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS WIDENING. THE PLACE OF RESIDENCE IS A FACTOR AFFECTING THE INVOLVEMENT IN DIGITALISATION, ALONG WITH AGE, EDUCATION, INCOME, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ICT INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE READINESS OF THE POPULATION OF VARIOUS RUSSIAN REGIONS TO EMBRACE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES. BASED ON A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF TRAFFIC TO THE MOST POPULAR WEBSITES ON THE RUSSIAN INTERNET, GROUPED INTO FIVE CATEGORIES (E-COMMERCE, E-GOVERNMENT, INFORMATION EXCHANGE, SPATIAL MOBILITY, SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION), AN INDEX METHOD FOR ASSESSING READINESS FOR DIGITALISATION IS DEVELOPED. THE STUDY USES YANDEX SEARCH DATA FROM FEBRUARY 2019 TO JANUARY 2021. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RUSSIAN REGIONS MAY BE DIVIDED INTO DIGITALLY ADVANCED AREAS, RUNNER-UPS, AVERAGE PERFORMERS, AND THE DIGITAL PERIPHERY. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GIVEN ON HOW TO INCREASE READINESS FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN TERRITORIES OF DIFFERENT TYPES WITHOUT RUNNING THE RISKS OF FORCED DIGITALISATION.","IMMANUEL KANT BALTIC FEDERAL UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA","IMMANUEL KANT BALTIC FEDERAL UNIVERSITY,RUSSIA","NAGIRNAYA A, 2015, DOI 10.1134/s2079970515020082; BILLON M, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s10290-016-0259-8; CHANG E, 2016, DOI 10.14246/irspsd.4.1_49; ŽILINSKAS G, 2012, DOI 10.5755/j01.ppaa.11.3.2506; WILSON C, 2019, DOI 10.18080/jtde.v7n2.187; ARKHIPOVA M, 2019, DOI 10.17059/2019-3-4; ШИНЯЕВА О, 2019, DOI 10.14515/monitoring.2019.4.04; SONG Z, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102072; POPOVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1088/1755-1315/433/1/012022; PLOTICHKINA N, 2020, DOI 10.20542/0131-2227-2020-64-4-70-83; BYCHKOVA S, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-44703-8_22; GLADKOVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1108/oir-04-2019-0121; KUC-CZARNECKA M, 2020, DOI 10.24136/oc.2020.017; HATUKA T, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.cities.2020.102978; PALMER-ABBS M, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2020.08.049; WANG D, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101516; REUSCHKE D, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.futures.2021.102714",2,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1141714239,ISI,IMMANUEL KANT BALTIC FEDERAL UNIVERSITY,IMMANUEL KANT BALTIC FEDERAL UNIVERSITY,NA,"MIKHAYLOVA AA, 2021, BALTIJSKIJ REGION","MIKHAYLOVA AA, 2021, BALTIJSKIJ REGION",RUSSIA,10.5922/2079-8555-2021-3-9,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1141714239,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE PROCESS OF DIGITALIZATION AS IT HAS UNFOLDED IN THE SERVICE SECTOR IN JAPAN. BASED ON QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH MANAGERS IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AND UNION OFFICIALS, THE PAPER DEPICTS A PROCESS THAT CONTRASTS STARKLY WITH THE MORE OPTIMISTIC VIEW ADOPTED BY SOME COMMENTATORS, ACCORDING TO WHICH DIGITALIZATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS AND CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE STABLE FORM OF GROWTH. INSTEAD, THE PAPER DRAWS ON REGULATION THEORY TO ARGUE THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF DIGITALIZATION IS PART OF A WIDER PROCESS OF NEOLIBERALIZATION. AS SUCH, DIGITALIZATION HAS CONTRIBUTED TO DESKILLING, THE FRAGMENTATION OF WORK TASKS, A DIGITAL DIVIDE, THE INTENSIFICATION OF WORK, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF WORKPLACE SURVEILLANCE. THIS REPRESENTS A FURTHER DISMANTLING OF THE SOCIAL COMPROMISE THAT UNDERPINNED JAPAN’S EARLIER PERIOD OF ECONOMIC GROWTH.","LEIDEN UNIVERSITY, NETHERLANDS","LEIDEN UNIVERSITY,NETHERLANDS","HIRSCH-KREINSEN H, 2016, DOI 10.1007/s12651-016-0200-6; DECKER M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.robot.2016.09.017; RUBERY J, 2001, DOI 10.1111/j.1564-913x.2001.tb00219.x; LECHEVALIER S, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2014.07.012; AMABLE B, 2015, DOI 10.1017/s1744137415000211; VIDAL M, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0950017013481876; EMA A, 2016, DOI 10.1109/mts.2016.2618719; NULL N, 2016, DOI 10.17265/2159-5313/2016.09.003; ZWICK A, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10708-017-9793-8; WATANABE H, 2017, DOI 10.1111/bjir.12258; SUGIYAMA M, 2017, DOI 10.3390/su9122193; AMABLE B, 2017, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198787815.001.0001; WU Q, 2018, DOI 10.1051/itmconf/20181703019; PUPILLO L, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_1; BOYER R, 2018, DOI 10.1080/09538259.2018.1449480; KOVACIC M, 2018, DOI 10.1080/14672715.2018.1512003; HIRANO Y, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-4-431-55001-3_16; BOYER R, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-4-431-55001-3; THELEN K, 2018, DOI 10.1017/s1537592718001081; MOORE P, 2019, DOI 10.16997/book29.j; MOODY K, 2018, DOI 10.1163/1569206x-00001745; WOOD A, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0038038519828906; SHIBATA S, 2019, DOI 10.1080/13563467.2019.1613351; DYER-WITHEFORD N, 2019, DOI 10.2307/j.ctvj4sxc6; HAY C, 2019, DOI 10.1080/09692290.2019.1633382; BOYER R, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-9053-1_5; LECHEVALIER S, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-9053-1; HEIN E, 2020, DOI 10.1080/09692290.2020.1744178; ANWAR M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1024529420914473; DAVIS G, 2021, DOI 10.1177/2631787721995198; WRIGHT J, 2021, DOI 10.1080/13511610.2021.1909460",14,2021,"HUMAN RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; HUMAN SOCIETY",PUB.1138664606,ISI,LEIDEN UNIVERSITY,LEIDEN UNIVERSITY,NA,"SHIBATA S, 2021, REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY","SHIBATA S, 2021, REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY",NETHERLANDS,10.1080/09692290.2021.1935294,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1138664606,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY LEAD TO SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR EXTENDING THE EXISTING INCLUSIVE TECHNOLOGY FRAMEWORK TO THE AUTHENTICATION CONTEXT.

THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO VERIFY THE SITUATION OF PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE PROVINCE OF BADAJOZ (EXTREMADURA) IN RELATION TO THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT THEY OFFER TO THE SENIORS. THE METHODOLOGY USED BEGINS WITH THE DESIGN OF A QUESTIONNAIRE DIVIDED INTO 6 SPECIFIC CATEGORIES ON TECHNOLOGY AND A TOTAL OF 40 QUESTIONS, AND ITS SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY TO 64 BADAJOZ PUBLIC LIBRARIES, PARTICIPANTS IN A PREVIOUS STUDY, WITH A RESPONSE RATE OF 50% (32 LIBRARIES). THROUGH THE USE OF DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, THE MAIN RESULTS SHOW THAT, ALTHOUGH THE ELDERLY WHO GO TO THE LIBRARY USE THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL NETWORKS IN A PROPORTION LOWER THAN 47%, HOWEVER, 87.5% OF THE RESPONDENTS CONSIDER THAT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE LIBRARY BY THIS SECTOR HAS INCREASED CONSIDERABLY IN RECENT YEARS, FAVORING THEIR INTEGRATION INTO SOCIETY. DESPITE THIS, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE LACK OF SPECIALIZED LIBRARIANS, THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS TRAINING IN TECHNOLOGIES AND THE SCARCE FUNDING, DO NOT FAVOR THE BADAJOZ PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO FULLY ADAPT TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.","UNIVERSITY OF EXTREMADURA, SPAIN","UNIVERSITY OF EXTREMADURA,SPAIN","HOFFMAN-GOETZ L, 2006, DOI 10.1300/j381v10n03_03; JUZNIC P, 2006, DOI 10.1108/03074800610677308; BRAUN M, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.004; LUYT B, 2011, DOI 10.1515/libr.2011.017; CAVANAGH M, 2012, DOI 10.1108/00242531211292114; DUESING A, 2004, DOI 10.1300/j381v08n03_04; NASMITH W, 2008, DOI 10.1108/02640470810910693; GÓMEZ F, 2015, DOI 10.5209/rev_rgid.2015.v25.n1.48988; HERNANDO GÓMEZ Á, 2014, DOI 10.16921/chasqui.v0i124.13; SÁNCHEZ-GARCÍA S, 2016, DOI 10.3145/epi.2016.mar.09; GONZÁLEZ L, 2013, DOI 10.6035/ariadna.2013.1.2; LENSTRA N, 2017, DOI 10.1515/nor-2017-0401; CASAMAYOU A, 2017, DOI 10.26864/pcs.v7.n2.9; JORDAN C, 2018, DOI 10.1080/02763877.2018.1472717; ALDANA GONZÁLEZ M, 2012, DOI 10.25009/cpue.v0i14.34",0,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1139458823,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF EXTREMADURA,UNIVERSITY OF EXTREMADURA,NA,"FABA-PÉREZ C, 2021, REVISTA GENERAL DE INFORMACIÓN Y DOCUMENTACIÓN","FABA-PÉREZ C, 2021, REVISTA GENERAL DE INFORMACIÓN Y DOCUMENTACIÓN",SPAIN,10.5209/rgid.73761,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1139458823,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE DIGNITY PROJECT (HTTPS://WWW.DIGNITY-PROJECT.EU/), A EUROPEAN INITIATIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION’S H2020 FRAMEWORK, AIMS TO PROMOTE AN ECOSYSTEM OF DIGITAL MOBILITY SERVICES THAT IS SUSTAINABLE, INTEGRATED, AND USER-FRIENDLY, AND WHICH IMPROVES ACCESSIBILITY, SOCIAL INCLUSION, DAILY MOBILITY EXPERIENCES, AND EVERYDAY LIFE OF ALL RESIDENTS. THE PROJECT SELECTED FOUR PILOT STUDIES IN FIVE EU COUNTRIES (SPAIN, ITALY, BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS, AND GERMANY) FOR THEIR INNOVATIVE PROPOSALS IN SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE MOBILITY. THE CASE STUDIES APPLY THE DIGNITY APPROACH, WHICH IS BASED ON CONDUCTING WORKSHOPS, INTERVIEWS, AND SURVEYS. HERE, WE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE STUDY BASED IN BARCELONA, WHICH IS AT THE FOREFRONT IN SMART URBAN TRANSFORMATION. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN MOBILITY IN THE BARCELONA METROPOLITAN AREA WAS EVALUATED USING A MIXED APPROACH OF COMBINING LITERATURE REVIEW WITH A QUANTITATIVE SURVEY. THE RESULTS REVEAL THE NEEDS AND PERCEPTIONS OF PEOPLE ABOUT LOCAL MOBILITY, AS WELL AS THE GAPS IN THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.","UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA, SPAIN","UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA,SPAIN","GROTH S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2019.04.018; LOOS E, 2020, DOI 10.3390/ijerph17207465",0,2021,"TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAINS; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1143718066,ISI,UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA;UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA,UNIVERSITAT POLITÈCNICA DE CATALUNYA,NA,"BOSCH ER, 2021, TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PROCEDIA","BOSCH ER, 2021, TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PROCEDIA",SPAIN,10.1016/j.trpro.2021.11.019,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1143718066,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

WELL-FOUNDED CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ON HOW THE RESTRICTIONS AFFECT YOUNG PEOPLE’S WELL-BEING AND THEIR POSSIBILITIES TO GET SUPPORT. YOUTHS USE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES, AND IT CAN BE ASSUMED THAT THE USAGE HAS INCREASED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH CAN ALSO BE A BENEFIT WHEN COPING WITH THE SITUATION. THIS PAPER EXPLORES YOUNG PEOPLE’S SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES REGARDING DIGITAL SERVICES, DIGITAL SOCIETAL PARTICIPATION, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS IN THE EARLY PHASES OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC. MOREOVER, THE YOUTHS’ BACKGROUNDS IN RELATION TO THEIR UTILISATION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES ARE EXAMINED. A MIXED-METHOD SURVEY INCLUDING CLOSED-ENDED AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS WAS CONDUCTED IN SPRING 2020. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 49 YOUNG FINNISH PEOPLE AGED 15–26. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DIGITALITY SUPPORTS YOUTHS IN THEIR ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS WORK AND SCHOOL, SOCIETAL PARTICIPATION, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. ALSO, PROBLEMS, SUCH AS INADEQUATE ICT SKILLS AND TECHNICAL ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED. FURTHERMORE, THE ICT-SAVVY YOUTHS SEEM TO BENEFIT HIGHLY FROM DIGITALITY IN COMPARISON TO THEIR LESS ICT-SAVVY PEERS. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE DISCUSSIONS OF DIGITAL DIVIDES, EQUAL ACCESS TO SOCIETAL PARTICIPATION, AND THE ACTIVITIES THAT MAY SUPPORT YOUTHS’ COPING IN SIMILAR FUTURE LOCKDOWN SITUATIONS.","TAMPERE UNIVERSITY, FINLAND;TAMPERE UNIVERSITY, FINLAND;TAMPERE UNIVERSITY, FINLAND;TAMPERE UNIVERSITY, FINLAND","TAMPERE UNIVERSITY,FINLAND","BLAND J, 1997, DOI 10.1136/bmj.314.7080.572; CRONBACH L, 1951, DOI 10.1007/bf02310555; BRAUN V, 2006, DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp063oa; BANDURA A, 1977, DOI 10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191; PANOPOULOU E, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.infoandorg.2014.08.001; BURNARD P, 1991, DOI 10.1016/0260-6917(91)90009-y; SÆBØ Ø, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2007.04.007; HÄSTBACKA E, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.alter.2016.02.002; CHECKOWAY B, 2011, DOI 10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.09.017; HOWARD M, 2014, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2014.0255; MALTERUD K, 2012, DOI 10.1177/1403494812465030; COMPEAU D, 1995, DOI 10.2307/249688; TRAFIMOW D, 2018, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00699; BANDURA A, 1995, DOI 10.1017/cbo9780511527692; PIETILÄ I, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-29384-0_28; NILSSON M, 2019, DOI 10.29379/jedem.v11i1.542; CHEW Q, 2020, DOI 10.11622/smedj.2020046; LIU P, 2020, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2020.0250; SHANAHAN L, 2020, DOI 10.1017/s003329172000241x; PETZOLD M, 2020, DOI 10.1002/brb3.1745; OMOTAYO F, 2020, DOI 10.29379/jedem.v12i1.585; PEARMAN A, 2020, DOI 10.1093/geronb/gbaa120; MOHAMMADZADEH F, 2020, DOI 10.34172/aim.2020.76; MERRY S, 2020, DOI 10.1111/camh.12429; SALIN M, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12219133; MONTAG C, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100313; BLANC J, 2021, DOI 10.1097/yco.0000000000000665; TEJEDOR S, 2020, DOI 10.1145/3434780.3436587; MUSHQUASH A, 2021, DOI 10.1080/07448481.2020.1865379",1,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1140744355,ISI,TAMPERE UNIVERSITY;TAMPERE UNIVERSITY;TAMPERE UNIVERSITY;TAMPERE UNIVERSITY,TAMPERE UNIVERSITY,NA,"PIETILÄ I, 2021, NA","PIETILÄ I, 2021, NA",FINLAND,10.1007/978-3-030-82824-0_1,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1140744355,NA,NA,NA,"ACADEMY OF FINLAND,AKA,HELSINKI,FINLAND",DIM

THE MAIN PROBLEMS OF TRANSITION OF THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY TO A DIGITAL FORMAT OF WORK, DEVELOPMENT, EXPANSION OF DIGITAL LITERACY, WAYS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF DIGITALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ARE REVEALED. THE CREATION OF COMPLEX DIGITAL MODELS OF PRODUCTION PROCESSES IN AGRICULTURE WILL INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS. THIS REQUIRES GENERALLY VALID AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WITH HUNDREDS OF PARAMETERS AND ANALYSIS OF BIG DATA, WHICH INCLUDES THE FORMATION AND ALGORITHMIZATION OF MANAGEMENT: EQUIPMENT, DEVICES, THINGS, PROCESSES, MONEY SUPPLY. EACH PLATFORM IS BUILT ON THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PROCESSES OF CROP PRODUCTION, LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, LOGISTICS OF SUPPLY AND SALE. THE BASIS OF THE DIGITAL PLATFORM WHICH IS BEING CREATED AS A KNOWLEDGE PLATFORM THAT REFLECTS THE AVAILABILITY OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN CREATING THE NECESSARY PROGRAMS AND PROVIDING FARMS WITH NEW IT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. THUS, ACCORDING TO OUR RESEARCH, IMPROVEMENT OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MAIN DIRECTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR; UPDATING THE HUMAN RESOURCES OF CITIZENS BY REDUCING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE; ORIENTATION TOWARDS THE USE OF DOMESTIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS; DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC TECHNOLOGIES CORRELATED WITH SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS. A COMPREHENSIVE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL PROGRAM SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE A TRAINING SYSTEM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTIONING OF DIGITAL AGRICULTURE, AND THIS REQUIRES THE MODERNIZATION OF THE ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS IN AGRICULTURAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.","KAZAN STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA;KAZAN STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA;UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT TISBI, RUSSIA;DAGESTAN STATE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA","KAZAN STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY,RUSSIA","ERMAKOVA E, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10556-010-9286-9; KASHAPOV N, 2016, DOI 10.1088/1757-899x/134/1/012012; ZHURAVLYOV V, 2018, DOI 10.3390/su10124410; SHARNIN A, 2019, DOI 10.1051/e3sconf/20199106005; ROSTOVA O, 2019, DOI 10.1088/1757-899x/497/1/012017; BUNKOVSKIY D, 2019, DOI 10.22394/2304-3369-2019-1-65-76; FATTAKHOV R, 2019, DOI 10.17059/2019-2-10; ZHAROVA M, 2019, DOI 10.1051/e3sconf/201911002033; ZAKIROVA A, 2019, DOI 10.1051/e3sconf/201911002073; ZHURAVLYOV V, 2019, DOI 10.3390/su11236667; MENTSIEV A, 2019, DOI 10.1088/1742-6596/1399/4/044022; AMIROVA E, 2020, DOI 10.1051/bioconf/20201700050; SUBAEVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1051/bioconf/20201700178; SUBAEVA A, 2020, DOI 10.1051/bioconf/20201700226; KRUPINA G, 2020, DOI 10.1051/bioconf/20201700230; ZHAKHOV N, 2020, DOI 10.32743/kuz.agri.2020.182-190; KOSNIKOV S, 2020, DOI 10.34069/ai/2020.28.04.56; BULATOVA E, 2020, DOI 10.5430/ijfr.v11n5p392; TIMIRYANOVA V, 2020, DOI 10.3390/economies8040087; ZOLKIN A, 2021, DOI 10.1088/1757-899x/1047/1/012106",0,2021,EARTH SCIENCES; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; GEOINFORMATICS,PUB.1142209851,ISI,KAZAN STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY;KAZAN STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT TISBI;DAGESTAN STATE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY,KAZAN STATE AGRARIAN UNIVERSITY,NA,"AMIROVA E, 2021, BIO WEB OF CONFERENCES","AMIROVA E, 2021, BIO WEB OF CONFERENCES",RUSSIA; RUSSIA; RUSSIA,10.1051/bioconf/20213700014,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1142209851,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO MAP SMES' DIGITAL MATURITY AND THEIR VIEWS ON HOW TO MANAGE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIGITALIZATION IN ORDER TO FOSTER COMPETITIVENESS IN LOCAL, REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS. THE STUDY DRAWS ON A RESOURCE-BASED PERSPECTIVE, WHICH VIEWS THE FIRM AS A UNIQUE BUNDLE OF ASSETS AND RESOURCES THAT, IF UTILIZED IN DISTINCTIVE WAYS, CAN CREATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE STUDY BUILDS ON TRIADIC RELATIONS AS AN INTERACTIVE LEARNING PROCESS THAT OCCURS IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN ACTORS AS THE CONCEPT OF OPEN INNOVATION POSTULATES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AS AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (IPA) STUDY OF SMES AND ACTORS IN INNOVATION SYSTEM IN GÄVLEBORG COUNTY IN SWEDEN. IT USES A QUALITATIVE APPROACH FEATURING IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, WORKSHOPS, AND FOCUS-GROUP INTERVIEWS. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST A DIGITAL DIVIDE BETWEEN SMES, WITH A DISCREPANCY IN OPPORTUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM THE DIGITALIZATION POTENTIAL AMONG THE POPULATION STUDIED. THE DIVIDE MANIFESTS ITSELF THROUGH ECONOMICS, USABILITY, AND EMPOWERMENT. DIGITALIZATION SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS MERELY A TECHNOLOGY ISSUE, BUT AS A BETTER WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS, AS A PLATFORM FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CRITICAL FACTORS FOR INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS THAT CREATES COMPETITIVE VALUES IN PRODUCTION WITH DIGITALIZATION AS A STARTING POINT AND CREATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOW AND WHAT CREATES COMPETITIVENESS IN EACH CRITICAL FACTOR.","UNIVERSITY OF GAEVLE, SWEDEN;UNIVERSITY OF GAEVLE, SWEDEN","UNIVERSITY OF GAEVLE,SWEDEN","TIAGO M, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2014.07.002; HELFAT C, 2003, DOI 10.1002/smj.332; CONNER K, 1991, DOI 10.1177/014920639101700109; TEECE D, 2007, DOI 10.1002/smj.640; TSENG S, 2014, DOI 10.1108/jeim-05-2012-0025; HAGBERG J, 2016, DOI 10.1108/ijrdm-09-2015-0140; MILGROM P, 1995, DOI 10.1016/0165-4101(94)00382-f; VIVES L, 2011, DOI 10.1108/1536-541111181921; LIANG T, 2010, DOI 10.1108/02635571011077807; IVANG R, 2009, DOI 10.1108/17505930911000856; HUNT S, 2000, DOI 10.1111/1468-2370.00029; LARKIN M, 2006, DOI 10.1191/1478088706qp062oa; KUTSIKOS K, 2014, DOI 10.1108/jsit-02-2014-0015; PETERAF M, 1993, DOI 10.1002/smj.4250140303; LUO Y, 2000, DOI 10.1016/s1090-9516(00)00043-2; BORGHINI S, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.indmarman.2008.05.006; PLESNER U, 2016, DOI 10.1108/jocm-09-2015-0159; SMITH J, 2004, DOI 10.1002/9780470776278.ch10; LEE J, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.procir.2014.02.001; DY A, 2016, DOI 10.1177/0018726716650730; SCHERER E, 2000, DOI 10.1108/09576050010340839; ADAK M, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.06.478; BOWMAN C, 2003, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2003.00380.x; HOLMLUND M, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jstp-12-2015-0256; BARNEY J, 1991, DOI 10.1177/014920639101700108; MARKIDES C, 2015, DOI 10.1108/s0742-332220150000033004; PRESTON P, 2012, DOI 10.1108/14636691211271244; WANG C, 2007, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2370.2007.00201.x; MICK D, 1998, DOI 10.1086/209531; BHARADWAJ S, 2007, DOI 10.1287/isre.1070.0148; CHATMAN J, 1991, DOI 10.2307/2393204; ERICKSON C, 1963, DOI 10.2307/2550822; BARNEY J, 1995, DOI 10.5465/ame.1995.9512032192; EISENHARDT K, 2007, DOI 10.5465/amj.2007.24160888; HAMEL G, 1989; LEE H, 2003, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2003.11045756; BHATT G, 2005, DOI 10.1080/07421222.2005.11045844; BENYAYER L, 2017, DOI 10.1108/jbs-09-2016-0094; BARILE S, 2017, DOI 10.1108/tqm-06-2017-0068; MOUSTAKAS C, 1994, DOI 10.4135/9781412995658; GUEST G, 2012, DOI 10.4135/9781483384436; CAPUTO A, 2018, DOI 10.1108/bpmj-11-2017-0334; SCHIAVI G, 2018, DOI 10.1108/inmr-03-2018-0013; LLOYD R, 2000, DOI 10.22459/ag.07.04.2000.06; OSARENKHOE A, 2020, DOI 10.1504/gber.2020.105040",2,2021,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS,PUB.1134981229,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF GAEVLE;UNIVERSITY OF GAEVLE,UNIVERSITY OF GAEVLE,NA,"OSARENKHOE A, 2021, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH","OSARENKHOE A, 2021, JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH",SWEDEN,10.4018/jitr.20211001.oa1,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1134981229,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

INFORMATION INEQUALITY IS SEEN AS A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLVED WITH THE HELP OF CONFIDENT ACTIONS OF THE STATE. DATA ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM OF THE «DIGITAL DIVIDE» AT THE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE INFORMATION SERVICES MARKET DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE INTERNET. THE GROWING NUMBER OF INTERNET USERS IS A GLOBAL TENDENCY, BUT AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE CLEAR DIFFERENCES, WHICH CREATES PROBLEMS FOR OBTAINING QUALITY EDUCATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE CONSEQUENCES OF INFORMATION INEQUALITY ARE CONSIDERED. ALONG WITH THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES IN SOCIETY, INEQUALITY BETWEEN CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION IS GROWING. SOME PEOPLE FOR VARIOUS REASONS MAY HAVE RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION, KNOWLEDGE, INFORMATION SERVICES, NEW DIGITAL PRODUCTS AND MODERN TECHNOLOGIES, WHILE OTHERS MAY NOT HAVE SIMILAR RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO THEM. THE STUDY FOUND THAT THE MARKET FOR INFORMATION SERVICES IS SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. ASPECTS THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING THE PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO INFORMATION SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INFORMATION SECURITY ARE PROVIDED. NEGATIVE TRANSACTIONAL EXTERNALITIES OCCUR IN THE MARKET OF INFORMATION SERVICES PRECISELY WHEN THERE IS A DECREASE IN INFORMATION SECURITY DUE TO VIOLATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY ONE PERSON IN RELATION TO ANOTHER, CAUSING THE LAST DAMAGE. TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF TRANSACTION COSTS ON MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN INFORMATION SERVICES, THE DIRECTIONS OF REDUCING TRANSACTION COSTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ARE SUBSTANTIATED. IN ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED THE ISSUE OF INFORMATION INEQUALITY. THE STUDY PRESENTS THE PRINCIPLES FOR OVERCOMING DIGITAL INEQUALITY.","V. N.

THIS REQUIRES A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF SMES BASED ON COLLECTIVE PERFORMANCE DETERMINANTS. SMES HAVE PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS THAT DIFFERENTIATE THEM FROM LARGE COMPANIES AND A MODEL THAT ALLOWS THEM TO IDENTIFY, LEVERAGE AND DEVELOP THEIR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES CAN HELP THEM TO ADVANCE IN DIGITAL MATURITY. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: AN IN-DEPTH REVIEW OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCE WAS CARRIED OUT ON SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE TO IDENTIFY THE DIGITAL CHALLENGES FACED BY SMES, AND WHAT DIGITAL CAPABILITIES THEY HAVE TO DEVELOP TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR THE REFINEMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCE FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MODEL, SIX EXPERTS WERE INTERVIEWED; THREE OF THEM ARE ACADEMICS AND THE OTHER THREE ARE PROFESSIONALS WITH MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN SMES. WE USED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, TO KEEP THE INTERVIEWS FOCUSED AND FACILITATE CROSS-DATA ANALYSIS BETWEEN EXPERTS. IN ADDITION, IT ALLOWED US THE POSSIBILITY OF ANALYZING NEW RELEVANT ASPECTS THAT COULD ARISE DURING THE INTERVIEW. FINDINGS: AS A RESULT OF THIS STUDY WE HAVE DEVELOPED A REFINED MODEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPETENCE FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION THAT ALLOWS SMES TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP THE DIGITAL CAPABILITIES NECESSARY TO ADVANCE IN THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, REFINED WITH THE OPINIONS OF SIX EXPERTS CONSULTED. WE WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE THE IMPORTANCE OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING AND ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO ADVANCE THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF SMES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE DEVELOPED MODEL IS USEFUL FOR SME MANAGERS TO KNOW WHAT THE INITIAL STARTING SITUATION IS, WHAT THE DIGITAL GAPS ARE AND TO BE ABLE TO PLAN THE ACTIONS TO DEVELOP THE NECESSARY DIGITAL CAPABILITIES TO ADVANCE TOWARDS DIGITAL MATURITY.","UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID, SPAIN","UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID,SPAIN","NORTH K, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-27303-7; UHL A, 2016, DOI 10.4324/9781315577166; BERMAN S, 2012, DOI 10.1108/10878571211209314; CHOO C, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2013.05.009; CHOO C, 2008, DOI 10.1002/asi.20797; CHOO C, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0165551506068159; LEGNER C, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s12599-017-0484-2; CARSON D, 2001, DOI 10.4135/9781849209625; BLATZ F, 2018, DOI 10.1109/ice.2018.8436251; MITTAL S, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-99707-0_20; SOUSA M, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2018.08.048; NG H, 2018, DOI 10.1109/ieem.2018.8607457; VIAL G, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2019.01.003; GURBAXANI V, 2019, DOI 10.17705/2msqe.00017; GONZÁLEZ-VARONA J, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12083071; GONZÁLEZ-VARONA J, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-62412-5_20",12,2021,"INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES",PUB.1134951426,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID;UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID;UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID;UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID,UNIVERSITY OF VALLADOLID,NA,"GONZÁLEZ-VARONA J, 2021, JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT","GONZÁLEZ-VARONA J, 2021, JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT",SPAIN,10.3926/jiem.3279,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1134951426,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IN MANY COUNTRIES, IT IS STILL CONSIDERED IN THE EARLY STAGES WITH AN UNDERESTIMATION OF ITS BENEFITS AND POTENTIALITY. ESPECIALLY IN ITALY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT OF DIGITALIZATION – PARTICULARLY OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) – ON THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR, FOR EXAMPLE, IN TERMS OF CLINICIAN'S JOBS AND PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE. DRAWING FROM SUCH PREMISES, THE PAPER AIMS TO FOCUS ON AN OVERLOOKED HEALTHCARE AREA RELATED TO THE CHRONIC HEART DISEASES FIELD AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH DT. THE AUTHORS AIM AT EXPLORING AND FRAMING THE MAIN VARIABLES OF REMOTE MONITORING (RM) ADOPTION AS A SPECIFIC ARCHETYPE OF HEALTHCARE DIGITALIZATION, BOTH ON PATIENTS AND MEDICAL STAFF LEVEL, BY SHEDDING SOME LIGHTS ON ITS OVERALL IMPLEMENTATION.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE AUTHORS EMPIRICALLY INQUIRY THE RM ADOPTION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CARDIOLOGY DEPARTMENT OF THE CASILINO GENERAL HOSPITAL OF ROME. TO ANSWER OUR RESEARCH QUESTION, THE AUTHORS RECONSTRUCT THE SALIENT INFORMATION BY USING INDUCTION-TYPE REASONING, DIRECT OBSERVATION AND INTERVIEWEES WITH 12 KEY INFORMANTS, AS WELL AS SECONDARY SOURCES ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE HOSPITAL (INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION, PRESENTATIONS AND TECHNICAL REPORTS).   FINDINGS ACCORDING TO A SOCIO-TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK, THE AUTHORS BUILD A MODEL COMPOSED OF FIVE MAIN VARIABLES RELATED TO MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS CLASSIFY SUCH VARIABLES INTO AN INPUT-PROCESS-OUTPUT (I-P-O) MODEL. RM ADOPTION DRIVER REPRESENTS THE INPUT; CULTURAL DIGITAL DIVIDE, STRUCTURE FLEXIBILITY AND REACTION TO CHANGE SERVE THE PROCESS AND FINALLY, RM OUTCOME STANDS FOR THE OUTPUT. ALL THESE FACTORS, INTERACTING TOGETHER, CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTANDING THE RM ADOPTION PROCESS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE AUTHORS' RESEARCH PRESENTS TWO MAIN LIMITATIONS. THE FIRST ONE IS RELATED TO USING A QUALITATIVE METHOD, WHICH IS LESS RELIABLE IN TERMS OF REPLICATION AND THE INTERPRETIVE ROLE OF RESEARCHERS. THE SECOND LIMITATION, CONNECTED TO THE FIRST ONE, IS RELATED TO THE STUDY'S SCALE LEVEL, WHICH FOCUSES ON A MONO-CENTRIC CONSISTENT LEVEL OF ANALYSIS.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE PAPER OFFERS A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RM ATTRIBUTES AND A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW FOR IMPROVING THE OVERALL QUALITY MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES BY SUGGESTING THAT CLINICIANS CAREFULLY EVALUATE BOTH HARD AND SOFT VARIABLES WHEN UNDERTAKING RM ADOPTION DECISIONS.   SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS RM TECHNOLOGIES COULD IMPACT ON SOCIETY BOTH IN ORDINARY SITUATIONS, BY PREVENTING PATIENT MOBILITY ISSUES AND TRANSPORT COSTS, AND IN EXTRAORDINARY TIMES (SUCH AS A PANDEMIC), WHERE TELEMEDICINE CONTRIBUTES TO SUPPORTING HOSPITALS IN SWAPPING IN-PERSON VISITS WITH REMOTE CONTROLS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) CONTAGION OR THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE STUDY ENRICHES THE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF RM ADOPTION WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. FROM A THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE AUTHORS CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTHCARE DT ADOPTION DEBATE BY FOCUSING ON THE MAIN VARIABLES CONTRIBUTING TO THE DT PROCESS BY CONSIDERING BOTH MEDICAL STAFF AND PATIENT'S ROLE. FROM A MANAGERIAL PERSPECTIVE, THE AUTHORS HIGHLIGHT THE MAIN ISSUES FOR RM OF CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT TO ENABLE THE TRANSITION TOWARD ITS ADOPTION. SUCH ISSUES RANGE FROM THE NEED FOR AWARENESS OF THE MEDICAL STAFF ABOUT RM ADVANTAGES TO THE NEED FOR ADAPTING THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROCESS OF THE PATIENTS.","UNIVERSITY OF ROME TOR VERGATA, ITALY;UNIVERSITY OF ROME TOR VERGATA, ITALY;UNIVERSITY OF ROME TOR VERGATA, ITALY","UNIVERSITY OF ROME TOR VERGATA,ITALY","BOOTH A, 2014, DOI 10.1002/9781118715598.ch21;

ARTICLE IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIELD OF ACCESSIBILITY IN THE TEACHING OF SIGN LANGUAGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PANORAMA, EXAMINING ITS APPLICABILITY, EVALUATION METHODS AS WELL AS THE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES USED TO IMPROVE TEACHING EXPERIENCES AND THE CREATION OF NEW MATERIALS, PROPOSING A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT RELATES THE TEACHING OF SIGN LANGUAGE AT DIFFERENT ACADEMIC LEVELS, THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS, AS WELL AS PARENTS, AND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE EDUCATIONAL INCLUSION. IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ADOPTION OF HYBRID TECHNOLOGY APPROACHES, FOLLOWING UNIVERSAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES, CAN HELP TO INTEGRATE ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND SIGN LANGUAGE LITERACY.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH  THE WORKING METHOD USED TO CARRY OUT THIS WORK CONSISTS OF A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. THIS IS A RESEARCH PROJECT BASED ON THE RECAPITULATION OF INFORMATION ABOUT SIGN LANGUAGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PANORAMA AND THE IMPROVEMENTS USED FOR ITS INSTRUCTION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE WELL-KNOWN PRISMA (MOHER ET AL. , 2009) IS USED TO SYNTHESIZE THE SEARCH CARRIED OUT. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS ABOUT PEDAGOGY IN THE TEACHING OF SIGN LANGUAGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL FIELD AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION FOR SIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT, INCORPORATING DIFFERENT APPROACHES AND PERSONAL ASSESSMENTS. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE METHOD CONSISTS OF IDENTIFYING AND ANALYZING THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS ON THE TEACHING OF SIGN LANGUAGE ON THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF NEW EDUCATIONAL MODELS WITH THE INCORPORATION OF VARIOUS DIDACTIC ADAPTATIONS, EVALUATING THE SELECTED ARTICLES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME FROM 2009 TO 2021. SIX STEPS WERE USED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDY (FIGURE 1). FIRST, STEPS 1–4 WERE CONDUCTED IN 2020 AND 2021 AS PART OF A DOCTORAL RESEARCH. A SCHEMATIC SUMMARY OF STEPS 1–4 IS PRESENTED BELOW, FOLLOWED BY STEPS 5 AND 6, ADDED LATER TO THE STUDY AFTER COMPLETION OF STEP 4. IN THE CASE OF THE FIRST FOUR STEPS THEY WERE CONDUCTED BY TWO RESEARCHERS: THE THESIS TUTOR AND THE DOCTORAL STUDENT, AND STEPS 5 AND 6 WERE CONDUCTED BY THE PH.    FINDINGS  TO CARRY OUT THE ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS, THE CODIFICATION OF THE VARIABLES WAS CARRIED OUT. THE SELECTED STUDIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THEIR INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT WITH A FINAL SELECTION OF 39 STUDIES HAVE FOUND SEVERAL VARIABLES THAT AFFECT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TEACHING OF SIGN LANGUAGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA AND THE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS TO ADAPT THEIR TEACHING TO STUDENTS (FIGURE 4). IN THIS SECTION WE PRESENT THE TECHNOLOGY GROUPED VARIABLES INCLUDED IN EACH FACTOR AND THE POSSIBILITIES OF STANDARDIZATION AND APPLICABILITY OF SIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING IN THE INTERNATIONAL PANORAMA. WITHIN THESE ARTICLES, THE IMPORTANCE OF DEFINING TRAINING PROGRAMS IN SIGN LANGUAGE FOR TEACHERS AND THE NEED TO EVALUATE TEACHING PROGRAMS IS IDENTIFIED, WITH A FOCUS ON ACTIONS TO IMPROVE SCHOOL CURRICULA TO ACHIEVE LINGUISTIC STANDARDIZATION AND INCLUSION IN THE ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS THEIR USE AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION. THEREFORE, PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES AND COOPERATION BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS: ASSOCIATIONS OF FAMILIES OF DEAF STUDENTS AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS MUST BE IMPROVED, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO GIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION. WITHIN THE EXCLUSION CRITERIA, THE ARTICLES THAT DO NOT USE SIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING TOOLS ( N  = 45) WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DISCARDED, FOLLOWED BY THE ARTICLES THAT DO NOT INDICATE ANY INTERVENTION IN STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ( N  = 48), CONCLUDING WITH THE ARTICLES THAT NONSIGN LANGUAGE DISABILITY EDUCATION ( N  = 44). SUBSEQUENTLY, AMONG THOSE SELECTED, THE TECHNOLOGY ARTICLES THAT DO NOT SPEAK ABOUT SIGN LANGUAGE WERE DISCARDED ( N  = 32), AS WELL AS THE STUDIES THAT PROTECT INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE BUT NOT SIGN LANGUAGE ( N  = 33) AND, TO CONCLUDE, THE LINGUISTIC NORMALIZATION ARTICLES BUT DO NOT CITE SIGN LANGUAGE ( N  = 37).    ORIGINALITY/VALUE COMMUNICATION IS THE ELEMENT BY WHICH THE AUTHORS CAN UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER WITH THE REST OF THE PEOPLE AROUND US, IN THE DIVERSITY OF LANGUAGE, WITHIN NON-VERBAL LANGUAGE, THE AUTHORS FIND SIGN LANGUAGE, THE LANGUAGE OF DEAF AND MUTE PEOPLE, OF FAMILIES, AS A PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEE AND NOWADAYS, LEARNED BY MANY NON-DEAF AND MUTE PEOPLE TO ACHIEVE A MORE INCLUSIVE AND INTEGRATED SOCIETY WITH ALL PEOPLE. EVERY COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO HAVE ITS OWN SIGN LANGUAGE, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT CLAIMS ITS CULTURE AND CUSTOMS, THROUGH NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION WITH WHICH TO EXPRESS MULTIPLE MEANINGS, EMOTIONS AND INTENTIONS. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW AND APPLY THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED, PROMOTING THE RIGHT TO AUTONOMY AND THE DEFENSE OF THE INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE AS A CULTURAL ELEMENT OF THE INTANGIBLE HERITAGE OF EACH COUNTRY. THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF CULTURE AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF WHERE ONE LIVES IN THE WORLD, IN AN INCREASINGLY GLOBALIZED SOCIETY IN WHICH COMMUNICATION PLAYS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE.

AVOIDING GENDER OR DIGITAL GAPS ARE PRIORITIES GENERALLY ASSUMED AS CONCERNS OF GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE DIGITAL GENDER DIVIDE IN ITS THREE STAGES: ACCESS, USE AND RESULTS, RELATING IT TO GENDER AND SALARY GAPS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. CLUSTER ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO CLASSIFY THE COUNTRIES ACCORDING TO THEIR GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE INFLUENCE OF AGE AND STUDIES LEVEL OF MALES AND FEMALES WAS REVISED. BASED ON THE OECD AND EUROSTAT DATA, AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. BY COMPARISON OF MEANS, THE SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES INFLUENCING THE GENDER DIGITAL DIVIDE WERE IDENTIFIED, PROBING THAT THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES IT, ESPECIALLY IN WHAT REFERS TO THE THIRD STAGE.

THIS IS KNOWN AS THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE."" TECHNOLOGY-RELATED EXCLUSION IS A POTENTIAL BARRIER TO THE EQUITABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL HEALTH. SLOWMO THERAPY WAS DEVELOPED WITH AN INCLUSIVE, HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN TO OPTIMIZE ACCESSIBILITY AND BRIDGE THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE."" SLOWMO IS AN EFFECTIVE, BLENDED DIGITAL PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY FOR PARANOIA IN PSYCHOSIS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" AND MOBILE APP ENGAGEMENT IN THE SLOWMO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. METHODS: DIGITAL LITERACY WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE, AND A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT OF ENGAGEMENT (IE, ADHERENCE [VIA SYSTEM ANALYTICS AND SELF-REPORT] AND SELF-REPORTED USER EXPERIENCE) WAS CONDUCTED AT 12 WEEKS AFTER THERAPY. ENGAGEMENT WAS INVESTIGATED IN RELATION TO DEMOGRAPHICS (IE, GENDER, AGE, ETHNICITY, AND PARANOIA SEVERITY). RESULTS: DIGITAL LITERACY DATA DEMONSTRATED THAT TECHNOLOGY USE AND CONFIDENCE WERE LOWER IN BLACK PEOPLE AND OLDER PEOPLE (N=168). THE ENGAGEMENT FINDINGS INDICATED THAT 80.7% (96/119) OF THERAPY COMPLETERS MET THE A PRIORI ANALYTICS ADHERENCE CRITERIA. HOWEVER, ANALYTICS ADHERENCE DID NOT DIFFER BY DEMOGRAPHICS. HIGH RATES OF USER EXPERIENCE WERE REPORTED OVERALL (OVERALL SCORE: MEAN 75%, SD 17.1%; N=82). NO DIFFERENCES IN USER EXPERIENCE WERE FOUND FOR ETHNICITY, AGE, OR PARANOIA SEVERITY, ALTHOUGH SELF-REPORTED APP USE, ENJOYMENT, AND USEFULNESS WERE HIGHER IN WOMEN THAN IN MEN. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED TECHNOLOGY-RELATED INEQUALITIES RELATED TO AGE AND ETHNICITY, WHICH DID NOT INFLUENCE ENGAGEMENT WITH SLOWMO, SUGGESTING THAT THE THERAPY DESIGN BRIDGED THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE."" INTERVENTION DESIGN MAY MODERATE THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES ON ENGAGEMENT. WE RECOMMEND THE ADOPTION OF INCLUSIVE, HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE ""DIGITAL DIVIDE"" ON THERAPY OUTCOMES.

IN THIS BELGIAN STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE EVOLUTION IN MOBILE ADOPTION BASED ON SURVEY DATA FROM 2019 TO 2020 (2019: N = 897; 2020: N = 895). WE EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN THE PROFILE OF MOBILE PAYERS IN TERMS OF THEIR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS, RETAIL, AND SOCIAL MEDIA BEHAVIOURS. THE PANDEMIC TRIGGERED A CLEAR UPLIFT IN MOBILE PAYMENT USERS BETWEEN 2019 TO 2020. NONETHELESS, STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE AND RETAIL PATRONAGE REMAIN. OUR DATA SHOWS THAT THERE IS STILL INEQUALITY IN ADOPTION, RELATED TO AGE AND SOCIAL GRADE. WE ALSO OBSERVE A CLEAR ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GENERAL IMPULSE BUYING TENDENCY AND MOBILE PAYMENT. THE LINK BETWEEN INTERNET/ONLINE SHOPPING AND MOBILE PAYMENT IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. FINALLY, MOBILE ADOPTION IS RELATED TO THE USE OF INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK. CONSEQUENCES FOR RETAILERS, RESEARCHERS AND PUBLIC OFFICERS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED.","VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL, BELGIUM;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL, BELGIUM;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL, BELGIUM","VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL,BELGIUM","YU R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109695; DAHLBERG T, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2007.02.001; VERHOEF P, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jretai.2015.02.005; ZHOU T, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.dss.2012.10.034; LIÉBANA-CABANILLAS F, 2014, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2014.03.022; MACKENZIE S, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jretai.2012.08.001; HAGBERG J, 2016, DOI 10.1108/ijrdm-09-2015-0140; LEMON K, 2016, DOI 10.1509/jm.15.0420; MIDI H, 2010, DOI 10.1080/09720502.2010.10700699; SCHIERZ P, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2009.07.005; GREWAL D, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jretai.2016.12.001; TAYLOR E, 2016, DOI 10.1108/ijrdm-05-2015-0065; ESOMAR EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR OPINION AND MARKETING RESEARCH E, 2003, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-9186-7_6; MALLAT N, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s00779-006-0126-z; KONUŞ U, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.jretai.2008.09.002; KACEN J, 2002, DOI 10.1207/s15327663jcp1202_08; LIÉBANA-CABANILLAS F, 2014, DOI 10.1108/imds-03-2013-0137; GROß M, 2015, DOI 10.1108/ijrdm-06-2013-0119; DAHLBERG T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.elerap.2015.07.006; SEE-TO E, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10660-014-9138-3; VERPLANKEN B, 2001, DOI 10.1002/per.423; LAUKKANEN T, 2008, DOI 10.1057/palgrave.fsm.4760077; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; MALLAT N, 2007, DOI 10.1016/j.jsis.2007.08.001; GARRETT J, 2014, DOI 10.1111/fcsr.12069; THAKUR R, 2014, DOI 10.1108/intr-12-2012-0244; OLIVEIRA T, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2016.03.030; ROOK D, 1995, DOI 10.1086/209452; PETERSON R, 1997, DOI 10.1177/0092070397254005; DWIVEDI Y, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s10796-017-9774-y; RIGGINS F, 2005, DOI 10.17705/1jais.00074; DAVIS F, 1989, DOI 10.2307/249008; VENKATESH V, 2003, DOI 10.2307/30036540; ARAGONCILLO L, 2018, DOI 10.1108/sjme-03-2018-007; MEYLL T, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.frl.2018.06.009; SHIAU W, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2018.06.006; VENKATESH V, 2012, DOI 10.2307/41410412; HELM S, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2018.09.015; HUMBANI M, 2019, DOI 10.1108/ijbm-03-2018-0072; ZHENG X, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.02.010; LIU Z, 2019, DOI 10.1007/s10660-019-09349-4; ELHAJJAR S, 2020, DOI 10.1108/ijbm-02-2019-0055; JÜNGER M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.frl.2019.08.008; LOH X, 2019, DOI 10.1080/08874417.2019.1688733; ALKHOWAITER W, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102102; CAI Y, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijpe.2020.107729; ROGGEVEEN A, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jretai.2020.04.002; HELLEMANS J, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-47595-6_24; PANTANO E, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.05.036; BROUGH A, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0743915620929999; VITHAYATHIL J, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102117; AL-SAEDI K, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101293; VERMA S, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.06.057; BELL L, 2020, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01546; GRASHUIS J, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12135369; ZHANG W, 2020, DOI 10.1007/s00779-020-01460-w; LIU Y, 2020, DOI 10.1002/cb.1880; TAMILMANI K, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102269; AMEEN N, 2020, DOI 10.1108/jsm-02-2020-0066; WEI M, 2021, DOI 10.3390/jtaer16040037; WILLEMS K, 2021, DOI 10.1007/978-981-33-4134-0_6; DOLEGA L, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102501; RENU N, 2021, DOI 10.1177/20503121211000912; ABDULLAH A, 2021, DOI 10.1080/23311975.2021.1893245; PAL A, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.respol.2021.104228; NANDA A, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.jum.2021.04.001; HELLEMANS J, 2021, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-76520-0_10; TAKEDA A, 2021, DOI 10.1504/ijtm.2021.115761; YANG F, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102683; RAFDINAL W, 2021, DOI 10.1108/ijbm-10-2020-0532; HOU J, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102741; HASAN R, 2021, DOI 10.1177/09721509211027402; HARGITTAI E, 2021, DOI 10.4337/9781788116572; SELDAL M, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s10603-022-09512-9; SAXENA N, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s10660-022-09556-6; GUERINI C, 2022, DOI 10.1007/978-3-031-05728-1_18; BRÜGGEMANN P, 2022, DOI 10.1007/978-3-031-05728-1_24; ZHAO C, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s10660-022-09549-5; AL-QUDAH A, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s10660-022-09577-1; DEMIRGÜÇ-KUNT A, 2022, DOI 10.1596/978-1-4648-1897-4",0,2022,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; BUSINESS SYSTEMS IN CONTEXT; MARKETING; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; INFORMATION SYSTEMS",PUB.1154026229,ISI,VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL;VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL,VRIJE UNIVERSITEIT BRUSSEL,NA,"HELLEMANS J, 2022, ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH","HELLEMANS J, 2022, ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH",BELGIUM,10.1007/s10660-022-09655-4,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1154026229,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THIS STUDY USES MULTI-SIGNAL PHYSIOLOGICAL ACQUISITION AS A CRITERION. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT: (1) OLDER USERS ARE MORE ATTRACTED TO ICONIC INFORMATION THAN TEXTUAL INFORMATION. (2) WHEN SEARCHING FOR COMPLEX TASKS, FEMALE USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BROWSE THE WHOLE PAGE BEFORE LOCATING THE JOB. (3) FEMALE USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BROWSE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM WHEN SEARCHING FOR COMPLEX TASKS. (4) FEMALE USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO CONCENTRATE WHEN PERFORMING COMPLEX TASKS THAN MALE USERS. (5) MALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE NERVOUS THAN FEMALES WHEN PERFORMING COMPLEX TASKS.","NANJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY, CHINA;JIANGSU CO-INNOVATION CENTER OF EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST RESOURCES, NANJING 210037, CHINA, CHINA;NANJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY, CHINA;JIANGSU CO-INNOVATION CENTER OF EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST RESOURCES, NANJING 210037, CHINA, CHINA;NANJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY, CHINA;NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM","JIANGSU CO-INNOVATION CENTER OF EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST RESOURCES, NANJING 210037, CHINA,CHINA","CAMPENHAUSEN M, 1999, DOI 10.1016/s0042-6989(98)00212-0; SPERING M, 2006, DOI 10.1037/0096-1523.32.5.1136; GONÇALVES V, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s10209-015-0429-9; COLLINS T, 2010, DOI 10.3389/neuro.09.014.2010; LIN C, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10660-018-9297-8; HOU G, 2018, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x18001022; JONIKAITIS D, 2019, DOI 10.1152/jn.00726.2017; LI Q, 2019, DOI 10.1080/0144929x.2019.1622786; LI Y, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.apergo.2019.05.019; SUNG G, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1550147719879354; REDDY G, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.102385; LI X, 2020, DOI 10.1177/1420326x20903375; BRIEDE-WESTERMEYER J, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12072690; XIONG X, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.121957; CHOI J, 2020, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2020.1785152; LI C, 2021, DOI 10.3233/jad-200485; ANNERER‐WALCHER S, 2021, DOI 10.1111/cogs.12977; WANG G, 2020, DOI 10.15376/biores.16.1.1186-1206; CHAO Y, 2021, DOI 10.1051/meca/2021035; JIN W, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s12652-021-03335-1; ZHU S, 2021, DOI 10.1093/iwc/iwab020; BRAHMA J, 2021, DOI 10.1109/jiot.2021.3126453; ZHOU Z, 2021, DOI 10.1080/10447318.2021.1976506; XIONG X, 2021, DOI 10.3390/app112311371; CHEN Y, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2021.104656; EOM S, 2022, DOI 10.1109/jiot.2022.3141112; OYARZO P, 2022, DOI 10.1111/psyp.13994; SALMAN H, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s10209-021-00856-6; ZHANG Z, 2022, DOI 10.1109/jiot.2022.3144980; BACHURINA V, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08826; ZHU M, 2022, DOI 10.1080/10803548.2022.2035087; YU N, 2022, DOI 10.3390/ijerph19042391; HOLLANDER J, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.concog.2022.103303; BIEG T, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2022.107249; AYUB S, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.seta.2022.102136; YU N, 2022, DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.828545; GUO J, 2022, DOI 10.1155/2022/7469090; WANG J, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s12144-022-02994-3; MESO A, 2022, DOI 10.1523/eneuro.0511-21.2022; LIU R, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.aap.2022.106693; ABDUROHMAN M, 2022, DOI 10.1109/access.2022.3177225; RAMADAN R, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.segan.2022.100785; STREET J, 2022, DOI 10.3390/ijerph19137817; KNOEFEL F, 2022, DOI 10.1177/08404704221103537; QIN Y, 2022, DOI 10.3390/coatings12070991; LIU D, 2022, DOI 10.1155/2022/9641143; OLIVEIRA J, 2022, DOI 10.3390/ijerph19158945; KULSOOM F, 2022, DOI 10.1007/s00521-022-07665-9",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1153807861,ISI,NANJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY;JIANGSU CO-INNOVATION CENTER OF EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST RESOURCES;NANJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY;JIANGSU CO-INNOVATION CENTER OF EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST RESOURCES;NANJING FORESTRY UNIVERSITY;NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY,JIANGSU CO-INNOVATION CENTER OF EFFICIENT PROCESSING AND UTILIZATION OF FOREST RESOURCES,NA,"HUANG T, 2022, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH","HUANG T, 2022, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH",CHINA; UNITED KINGDOM,10.3390/ijerph192416937,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1153807861,NA,NA,NA,"MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA,MOST,BEIJING,CHINA",DIM

FROM A METHODOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE EMPIRICAL STUDY FOCUSED ON PERFORMING THE DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (DEA) NON-PARAMETRIC TEST. MEASURING THE DIGITALIZATION EFFICIENCY OR INEFFICIENCY OF THE EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES WAS CONDUCTED BY USING AN OUTPUT-ORIENTED MODEL, FOCUSED ON OUTPUT MAXIMIZATION FOR A GIVEN LEVEL OF INPUT, ASSUMING CONSTANT RETURNS TO SCALE (CRS). THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHTED MAJOR DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. SOLELY EIGHT COUNTRIES OUT OF 27 CAN BE CONSIDERED EFFICIENT IN THE DIGITALIZATION PROCESSES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BASED ON THE MODEL, THE MOST EFFICIENT EU COUNTRIES COULD BE CONSIDERED PEERS/BENCHMARKS FOR THE INEFFICIENT ONES, WHICH SHOULD EXAMINE THE BEST PRACTICES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR CURRENT SITUATION.","ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY, ROMANIA;ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY, ROMANIA;LUCIAN BLAGA UNIVERSITY OF SIBIU, ROMANIA;ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY, ROMANIA","ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY,ROMANIA","CHARNES A, 1989, DOI 10.1016/0038-0121(89)90001-3; COOPER W, 2011, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-6151-8; BILLON M, 2010, DOI 10.1007/s10290-009-0045-y; CHARNES A, 1978, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(78)90138-8; LÁBAJ M, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s10663-014-9262-2; CHARNES A, 1981, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.27.6.668; THANASSOULIS E, 2008, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183528.003.0003; SCHALLMO D, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-72844-5; İNEL M, 2019, DOI 10.5267/j.msl.2019.1.008; BANHIDI Z, 2019, DOI 10.21638/spbu05.2019.405; MATHEWS R, 2020, DOI 10.1093/nutrit/nuaa052; KAMOLOV S, 2020, DOI 10.1051/e3sconf/202020803048; GONG C, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.technovation.2020.102217; BENÍTEZ R, 2021, DOI 10.3390/su13126774; YALÇIN E, 2021, DOI 10.53615/2232-5697.10.323-333",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1150918080,ISI,ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY;ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY;LUCIAN BLAGA UNIVERSITY OF SIBIU;ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY,ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIVERSITY,NA,"GEORGESCU MR, 2022, PROCEDIA COMPUTER SCIENCE","GEORGESCU MR, 2022, PROCEDIA COMPUTER SCIENCE",ROMANIA; ROMANIA,10.1016/j.procs.2022.08.053,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1150918080,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

RECENTLY, SKILLS AND COMPETENCY, WHICH ARE THE SUB-TOPICS TO BE EXAMINED UNDER EDUCATION, HAVE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT ISSUES WITHIN THE NETWORK AND INFORMATION SOCIETY. UNIVERSITIES THAT WERE ALREADY IN A SLOW ADOPTION PROCESS HAD TO COME UP WITH RAPID AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS BECAUSE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. EDUCATORS BECAME CAPABLE TO OFFER SOLUTIONS IN TEACHING AND LEARNING BY USING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT). THEREFORE, A SURVEY IS CONDUCTED ON THE EDUCATORS’ USE OR CAPABILITY TO UTILIZE EDUCATION-RELATED DIGITAL TOOLS BEFORE AND AFTER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE IS WHETHER THE PRINCIPAL METHOD THEY USED IN THIS ADAPTATION PROCESS WAS BASED ON PERSONAL LEARNING OR WAS CARRIED OUT THROUGH FORMAL EDUCATION. ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON ACADEMIC’S INFORMATION AND STRATEGIC SKILLS, A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED ON STUDENTS ADDRESSING THE SAME SUBJECTS AS WELL. AS AN OUTCOME, IT WAS REASONABLE TO COMPARE THE BEHAVIOR PATTERNS OF STUDENTS AND ACADEMICS AND INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES ON THE SECOND-LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE. IT IS AN INEVITABLE FACT THAT EDUCATORS EXPERIENCED MANY DIFFICULTIES IN THIS RAPID TRANSITION PERIOD. EVEN WHERE TRADITIONAL EDUCATION CONTINUES, THIS PROCESS HAS GIVEN EDUCATORS NEW EDUCATION SKILLS. IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO SAY THAT THIS PROCESS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO CLOSING THE INFORMATION AND STRATEGIC SKILLS GAP AMONG ACADEMICS, THEREBY BRIDGING THE SECOND LEVEL OF DIGITAL DIVIDE.","TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN;UNIVERSIDAD INTERNACIONAL DE LA RIOJA, SPAIN;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID, SPAIN","TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,SPAIN","SELWYN N, 2004, DOI 10.1177/1461444804042519; VAN DIJK J, 2006, DOI 10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004; VAN DEURSEN A, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444810386774; YU L, 2006, DOI 10.1177/0961000606070600; GUNKEL D, 2003, DOI 10.1177/146144480354003; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; THOMPSON K, 2004, DOI 10.1086/382851; HOFFMAN D, 2006, DOI 10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00341.x; WEI K, 2011, DOI 10.1287/isre.1090.0273; HARGITTAI E, 2002, DOI 10.5210/fm.v7i4.942; VAN DIJK J, 2005, DOI 10.4135/9781452229812; SOOMRO K, 2020, DOI 10.1186/s41239-020-00191-5; BAPUJI H, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0149206320925881; HASSELL L, 2021, DOI 10.1177/2374289521994240; SHACKLETON L, 2021, DOI 10.1016/b978-0-323-88493-8.00015-x; LYTHREATIS S, 2022, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121359; LIU J, 2021, DOI 10.1177/21582440211060810; SAMANCIOGLU N, 2021, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-85720-2_3; SUN M, 2022, DOI 10.3389/fpubh.2021.796210; HÄMMERLE V, 2022, DOI 10.5220/0011068200003188",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; EDUCATION SYSTEMS; EDUCATION,PUB.1152191140,ISI,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MADRID;UNIVERSIDAD INTERNACIONAL DE LA RIOJA;COMPLUTENSE UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF MADRID,NA,"SAMANCIOGLU N, 2022, NA","SAMANCIOGLU N, 2022, NA",SPAIN; SPAIN; SPAIN,10.1007/978-3-031-14775-3_13,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1152191140,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

E-GOVERNMENT AND DIGITAL-GOVERNMENT TOOLS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DELIVER SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS AND OPTIMIZE THE DELIVERY OF PUBLIC SERVICES. NEVERTHELESS, EVEN IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, THERE ARE STILL CITIZENS WHO DO NOT HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY OR ARE NOT COMPETENT USERS. FILING TAXES OR APPLYING FOR SOCIAL WELFARE BENEFITS ONLINE ARE FAR FROM OBVIOUS TASKS FOR MANY CITIZENS WORLDWIDE. THE DIGITIZATION-BY-DEFAULT OF PUBLIC SERVICES IS CURRENTLY LEAVING MANY INDIVIDUALS BEHIND. AS NEW DIGITAL DIVIDES EMERGE, DIGITAL INEQUALITY IS NOT ONLY REPRODUCING LONGSTANDING SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITIES BUT ALSO PLACING ITSELF AS A STANDALONE SOURCE OF EXCLUSION. WHILE THERE IS ABUNDANT HUMANITIES LITERATURE ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP, RECENT LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP HAS OVERLOOKED THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE UNEQUAL ACCESS AND USAGE OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT. THIS EXPLORATORY PAPER DISCUSSES THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF CURRENT POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE DIGITAL EXCLUSION OF CITIZENS. IT ARGUES THAT DIGITAL EXCLUSION MAY AMOUNT TO THE UNEQUAL TREATMENT OF CITIZENS, AND DISCUSSES MORE INCLUSIVE APPROACHES TO DIGITAL GOVERNMENT.","UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS","UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS","ELKADI H, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.eij.2013.06.002; MISSINGHAM R, 2009, DOI 10.1080/00049670.2009.10735927; CHOI M, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2017.01.002; ALPER M, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444816686323; HELSPER E, 2016, DOI 10.1177/1461444816634676; GOODE J, 2010, DOI 10.1177/1461444809343560; MIN S, 2010, DOI 10.1080/19331680903109402; DASKAL E, 2017, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2016.1271903; WEST D, 2004, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00343.x; LINDGREN I, 2013, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2012.10.005; HILDEBRANDT M, 2006, DOI 10.1007/s11623-006-0140-3; GONZALES A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1050438; POWELL A, 2012, DOI 10.2202/1944-2866.1058; HAIGHT M, 2014, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2014.891633; JANOWSKI T, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2015.07.001; WIMMER M, 2002, DOI 10.1016/s1567-4223(02)00008-x; TIRADO-MORUETA R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1111401; LIVINGSTONE S, 2014, DOI 10.1080/17482798.2014.961496; VAN DIJK J, 2003, DOI 10.1080/01972240309487; LAYNE K, 2001, DOI 10.1016/s0740-624x(01)00066-1; BASU S, 2004, DOI 10.1080/13600860410001674779; YEUNG K, 2016, DOI 10.1111/lapo.12057; ERIKSSON K, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-9299.2011.01996.x; FUCHS C, 2008, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2006.06.004; MEIJER A, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0275074014551381; GRAHAM F, 2014, DOI 10.1177/0275074014561116; TVERSKY A, 1981, DOI 10.1126/science.7455683; STOICIU A, 2011, DOI 10.18356/d51f530b-en; OKUNOLA O, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2017.02.002; HARRIS C, 2017, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0175011; ROY J, 2017, DOI 10.1111/capa.12231; PARENT M, 2004, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2004.1265304; CASTELLS M, 2002, DOI 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199255771.001.0001; DIMITRAKOPOULOU D, 2018, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-32001-4_72-1; BAROCAS S, 2016, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.2477899; VOERMANS W, 2011, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.1855595; SCHOU J, 2018, DOI 10.1080/13621025.2018.1477920; MATTHEWS K, 2018, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x18000326; SCHOLTA H, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2018.11.010; KNOX C, 2019, DOI 10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.629; MAHMOOD M, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0020852318816798; LINDGREN I, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.giq.2019.03.002; GANTCHEV V, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1388262719838109; LUTZ C, 2019, DOI 10.1002/hbe2.140; PARK S, 2019, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2019.1606266; POLLICINO O, 2020, DOI 10.1017/9781108676106.021; RANCHORDAS S, 2019, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3512114; GRAN A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2020.1736124; ROGERS A, 2016, DOI 10.36643/mjrl.22.1.how; FORTSAKIS T, 2005, DOI 10.54648/euro2005019",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; HUMAN SOCIETY,PUB.1150793138,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN,UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN,NA,"RANCHORDÁS S, 2022, NA","RANCHORDÁS S, 2022, NA",NETHERLANDS,10.1007/978-3-031-07377-9_7,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1150793138,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS LIVE ALONE, WHICH PROMOTES LONELINESS AND DEPRESSION RISKS. ALSO, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EXACERBATES THESE ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL DIFFICULTIES, SINCE OLDER ADULTS ARE NOT ABLE TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO COMMUNICATE. A SOCIALLY ASSISTIVE ROBOT COULD HELP TO ADDRESS THESE LONELINESS AND DIGITAL DIVIDE PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, IT IS CRITICAL TO INCORPORATE AFFECTIVENESS AND NATURALNESS TO PROMOTE THE USER ACCEPTANCE OF THE ROBOT. THIS PROJECT MAKES USE OF THE EXISTING EVA OPEN-SOURCE ROBOTICS PLATFORM. THE AIM IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OLDER ADULTS BY BOOSTING THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND ALLEVIATING LONELINESS OR OTHER EMOTIONAL ISSUES THAT CAN ARISE. TO IMPROVE THE USER ACCEPTANCE AND TO GET A MORE NATURAL, AFFECTIVE, NON-PASSIVE BEHAVIOR, THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO INTEGRATE SEVERAL ASPECTS TO THE EVA ROBOT: A) ASSISTIVENESS THROUGH CONVERSATIONS AND A SOCIAL MESSAGING END-USER SKILL TO REDUCE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE; B) PROACTIVITY BY MEANS OF PROACTIVE INTERVENTIONS SO EVA IS ABLE TO START CONVERSATIONS; C) AFFECTIVITY BY MEANS OF SHOWING EMOTIONS WITH EYES EXPRESSIONS, USER RECOGNITION AND EMOTION ANALYSIS IN USER INPUT; AND D) NATURALNESS BY BLENDING ALL THESE CHARACTERISTICS WITH A LOW RESPONSE TIME IN THE INTERACTION AND THE NOVEL WAKEFACE ACTIVATION METHOD. FINALLY, A TECHNICAL EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF ITS APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE.","UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA, SPAIN;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO, UNITED STATES;CENTER FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HIGHER EDUCATION AT ENSENADA, MEXICO","UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA,SPAIN","SORRI L, 2008, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-68504-3_29; ARRANZ L, 2009, DOI 10.1016/j.regg.2008.12.001; LIU W, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2; ROBINSON H, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s12369-014-0242-2; FUJITA M, 2001, DOI 10.1177/02783640122068092; KRIGLSTEIN S, 2005, DOI 10.1145/1056808.1057106; GRAF B, 2004, DOI 10.1023/b:auro.0000016865.35796.e9; STIEHL W, 2009, DOI 10.1145/1551788.1551872; CHOPIK W, 2016, DOI 10.1089/cyber.2016.0151; ŠABANOVIĆ S, 2013, DOI 10.1109/icorr.2013.6650427; DE GRAAF M, 2017, DOI 10.1145/2909824.3020236; FEIL-SEIFER D, 2005, DOI 10.1109/icorr.2005.1501143; BRAVO J, 2018, DOI 10.3390/s18051569; MANN W, 2005, DOI 10.1002/0471743941; TAN M, 2019, DOI 10.48550/arxiv.1911.09070; CRUZ-SANDOVAL D, 2020, DOI 10.1145/3319502.3374840",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; HUMAN-CENTRED COMPUTING,PUB.1152912596,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA;UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA;CENTER FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND HIGHER EDUCATION AT ENSENADA,UNIVERSITY OF CASTILLA-LA MANCHA,NA,"VILLA L, 2022, NA","VILLA L, 2022, NA",SPAIN; USA; MEXICO,10.1007/978-3-031-21333-5_23,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1152912596,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IT IS INCREASINGLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CITIZENS, GOVERNMENTS, AND BUSINESSES NEED TO DEVELOP SKILLS AND MOTIVATIONS TO USE TECHNOLOGIES. IT IS ALSO RECOGNISED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE AMONG THOSE WHO GAIN THE LEAST FROM OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN AND BENEFIT FROM AN EVER-EVOLVING DIGITAL SOCIETY. AS WITH OTHER AREAS OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT, LOCAL COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS AND ACTORS ASSUME THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING INITIATIVES TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES AND ADVANCE DIGITAL LITERACY AND IN THIS REGARD, PUBLIC LIBRARIES HAVE LED AND CONTINUE TO HOLD CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO CHAMPION THIS AREA. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF A 14-MONTH COMMUNITY-BASED COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT WITH PUBLIC LIBRARIES ENGAGED IN A PROCESS OF DEVELOPING CODING CLUBS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN RURAL MANITOBA, CANADA. OUR RESEARCH SETS OUT TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS: FIRST, WHETHER IT IS VIABLE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO CULTIVATE ADVANCED DIGITAL SKILLS AMONG RURAL YOUTH AND CONTRIBUTE TO BRIDGING THE RURAL-URBAN DIGITAL DIVIDE BY RUNNING CODING CLUBS FOLLOWING THE CODERDOJO MODEL? AND SECOND, WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL CONDITIONS TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF PUBLIC LIBRARY CODING CLUBS? IN EXAMINING SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES ENCOUNTERED IN ADOPTING THE CODING CLUB AS A MODEL OF DIGITAL LITERACY BUILDING, WE DISCUSS WIDER THEMES FOR RURAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES INTERESTED IN ADVANCING DIGITAL LITERACY BUILDING WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES.","UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG, CANADA;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND, GALWAY, IRELAND;PORT MOODY PUBLIC LIBRARY, CANADA, CANADA","UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG,CANADA","CAWLEY A, 2010, DOI 10.1108/00012531011015181; HARGITTAI E, 2010, DOI 10.1111/j.1475-682x.2009.00317.x; BENNETT S, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8535.2007.00793.x; SALEMINK K, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2015.09.001; HELSPER E, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01416.x; ROBERTS E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2016.03.001; EYNON R, 2015, DOI 10.1080/17439884.2014.1002845; CORNELIUSSEN H, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1093529; ROBERTS E, 2015, DOI 10.1080/14702541.2015.1068947; REIMER B, 2008, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-954x.2008.00787.x; VAN DEURSEN A, 2013, DOI 10.1177/1461444813487959; WILSON V, 2008, DOI 10.1108/01435120810894554; SMITH N, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2538862.2538919; BECKINSALE M, 2006, DOI 10.1068/c0559; HELSPER E, 2010, DOI 10.1080/01411920902989227; TOWNSEND L, 2015, DOI 10.1080/14702541.2014.978807; PRENSKY M, 2001, DOI 10.1108/10748120110424816; BILANDZIC M, 2013, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2013.825811; SÁEZ-LÓPEZ J, 2016, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.003; GARCIA A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/10573569.2014.962203; ADAMS J, 2012, DOI 10.1145/2157136.2157319; WHITACRE B, 2014, DOI 10.1007/s00168-014-0637-x; TOWNSEND L, 2014, DOI 10.1111/soru.12068; JAEGER P, 2012, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2012.654728; MEERBAUM-SALANT O, 2013, DOI 10.1080/08993408.2013.832022; HOUGHTON K, 2013, DOI 10.1080/00049670.2013.771764; TOWNSEND L, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0269094213496974; LIVINGSTONE S, 2007, DOI 10.1177/1461444807080335; MONTAGUE R, 2015, DOI 10.1353/lib.2015.0049; VICKERY J, 2014, DOI 10.1002/jaal.263; VAN DEURSEN A, 2015, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2015.1078834; FORCIER E, 2013, DOI 10.1142/s0219649213500391; HELSPER E, 2013, DOI 10.1177/0267323113499113; WILLETT R, 2016, DOI 10.1086/686676; MEHRA B, 2017, DOI 10.1086/689312; HARGITTAI E, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0894439310397146; VAN LAAR E, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.010; LARONDE G, 2017, DOI 10.19030/jier.v13i1.9963; WYATT D, 2017, DOI 10.1177/1461444817738235; GARNELI V, 2015, DOI 10.1109/educon.2015.7096023; PAPAVLASOPOULOU S, 2017, DOI 10.1109/educon.2017.7943096; SHERIDAN I, 2016, DOI 10.21125/inted.2016.0545; PASSEY D, 2018, DOI 10.1007/s10758-018-9384-x; PERRYMAN C, 2019, DOI 10.1080/01616846.2019.1621736; STROVER S, 2019, DOI 10.1080/22041451.2019.1601487; STROVER S, 2019, DOI 10.1177/0163443719853504; FRAILLON J, 2020, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-38781-5",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES,PUB.1147604130,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF IRELAND;PORT MOODY PUBLIC LIBRARY,UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG,NA,"KELLY W, 2022, JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE","KELLY W, 2022, JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE",CANADA; IRELAND,10.1177/09610006221090953,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1147604130,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE MAIN METHODOLOGICAL TOOLS APPLIED IN THE STUDY WERE COMPARATIVE LEGAL ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONAL METHOD. THE STUDY SHOWED THAT EFFECTIVE MANIFESTATION OF WILL REQUIRES FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS OF ELECTRONIC PETITIONS, DIGITAL RESOURCES AND ELECTRONIC VOTING. RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES SHOULD SERVE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION AND DISCUSSION. IT IS SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE PRIORITY DIRECTIONS OF CHANGES IN LEGAL SYSTEMS SHOULD BE: 1) REFORMS AIMED AT CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES; 2) TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE ELECTRONIC VOTING PROCEDURE; 3) INCREASING THE RELEVANT INFORMATIZATION OF CITIZENS; 4) ENSURING MAXIMUM PROTECTION OF THE STATE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT. SPECIAL ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE LEGAL DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE TECHNOCRATIC APPROACH. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS DESIRABLE TO APPLY HYBRID TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE TO REALIZE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE AND GIVE THEM MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESSES OF GOVERNANCE AND DIGITAL GOVERNANCE.","V.

OUR WORK AIMS TO BRIDGE THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE BY PROPOSING SOLUTIONS FOR NETWORK DEPLOYMENT IN REMOTE AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, A NUMBER OF ACCESS POINTS (APS) ARE DEPLOYED AS AN INTERFACE BETWEEN THE USERS AND BACKHAUL NODES (BNS). THE MAIN CHALLENGES INCLUDE DESIGNING THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF THE APS, AND CONNECTING THEM TO THE BNS. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE FIRST PROPOSE A METRIC CALLED CONNECTIVITY RATIO TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE DEPLOYMENT. NEXT, WE PROPOSE AN AGILE SEARCH ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF APS THAT MAXIMIZES THIS METRIC AND PERFORM CLUSTERING TO FIND THE OPTIMAL LOCATIONS OF THE APS. FURTHERMORE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL ALGORITHM INSPIRED BY INFECTION DYNAMICS TO CONNECT ALL THE DEPLOYED APS TO THE EXISTING BNS ECONOMICALLY. TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING TERRESTRIAL BNS, WE INVESTIGATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF NON-TERRESTRIAL BNS, WHICH FURTHER IMPROVES THE NETWORK PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF AVERAGE HOP COUNT, TRAFFIC DISTRIBUTION, AND BACKHAUL LENGTH. FINALLY, WE USE REAL DATASETS FROM A REMOTE VILLAGE TO TEST OUR SOLUTION.","KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SAUDI ARABIA;KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SAUDI ARABIA;CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, SWEDEN;DURHAM UNIVERSITY, UNITED KINGDOM;KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, SAUDI ARABIA","KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,SAUDI ARABIA","INABA M, 1994, DOI 10.1145/177424.178042; ARTHUR D, 2006, DOI 10.1145/1137856.1137880; MAY R, 2001, DOI 10.1103/physreve.64.066112; LIU Z, 2003, DOI 10.1103/physreve.67.031911; SU X, 2013, DOI 10.1109/icoin.2013.6496431; AB-HAMID K, 2011, DOI 10.1109/glocomw.2011.6162337; YAACOUB E, 2020, DOI 10.1109/jproc.2020.2976703; KHATURIA M, 2020, DOI 10.1109/mcomstd.001.1900006; YAACOUB E, 2021, DOI 10.1109/iotm.0001.1900061; MATRACIA M, 2021, DOI 10.1109/ojvt.2021.3076814; CHAOUB A, 2022, DOI 10.1109/mwc.001.2100137; FOURATI F, 2021, DOI 10.23919/icn.2021.0015; ZHANG C, 2022, DOI 10.3389/frcmn.2022.785933",0,2022,DATA MANAGEMENT AND DATA SCIENCE; DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND SYSTEMS SOFTWARE; INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1145018498,ISI,KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;DURHAM UNIVERSITY;KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,KING ABDULLAH UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,NA,"RAHMAN AU, 2022, IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS","RAHMAN AU, 2022, IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS",SAUDI ARABIA; SWEDEN; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1109/lcomm.2022.3146606,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1145018498,NA,NA,NA,"KLAUS TSCHIRA FOUNDATION,KTS,HEIDELBERG,GERMANY",DIM

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING THE COMBINED INTERACTION OF THESE TWO MEDIA WITHIN THE AGEING CITIZEN CONTEXT. THIS RESEARCH, IN LIGHT OF THE PARADIGMS OF COMPLEXITY AND INFORMATIONALISM, EPISTEMOLOGICALLY AND ANTAGONISTICALLY ANALYZES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OLDER ADULTS, ONLINE COMMUNITIES, AND DIGITAL GAMES. AS A RESULT OF THIS DISRUPTIVE THINKING, A NEW TRANSDISCIPLINARY TERM EMERGES – ONLINE GAMEABLE COMMUNITIES. IN CONCLUSION, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS NEW MEDIUM WILL ALLOW A GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF OLDER ADULTS WITH TECHNOLOGY, WHILE FOSTERING SOCIALIZATION, TECHNOLOGICAL LEARNING, WELL-BEING, AND AN ACTIVE AND HEALTHY AGEING.","UNIVERSITY OF AVEIRO, PORTUGAL;UNIVERSITY OF AVEIRO, PORTUGAL","UNIVERSITY OF AVEIRO,PORTUGAL","NIMROD G, 2010, DOI 10.1093/geront/gnq084; PLANT R, 2004, DOI 10.1016/j.techsoc.2003.10.005; GENARO MOTTI L, 2014, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-07446-7_7; LEIST A, 2013, DOI 10.1159/000346818; WILLIE C, 2000, DOI 10.17763/haer.70.2.838w67647mq44168; ENG P, 2002, DOI 10.1093/aje/155.8.700; GHAZAWNEH A, 2012, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2575.2012.00406.x; FORSMAN A, 2015, DOI 10.1177/0733464815595509; FORSELL Y, 1997, DOI 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1997.tb00382.x; VILLANI D, 2016, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-49655-9_20; PREECE J, 2000, DOI 10.1108/imds.2000.100.9.459.3; OSMANOVIC S, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1555412015602819; TIWANA A, 2010, DOI 10.1287/isre.1100.0323; PARK C, 2012, DOI 10.1109/is3e.2012.6414950; PYAE A, 2015, DOI 10.1109/coginfocom.2015.7390588; WATTERS C, 2006, DOI 10.1109/hicss.2006.179; CASTELLS M, 2009, DOI 10.1002/9781444319514; SCHELL R, 2015, DOI 10.5220/0005524002690275; HAUSKNECHT S, 2015, DOI 10.5220/0005526802760284; PAPPAS M, 2019, DOI 10.3390/socsci8010006; KAUFMAN D, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-22015-0_13; SIXSMITH A, 2020, DOI 10.1108/qaoa-07-2020-0029; BOUGNOUX D, 2001, DOI 10.3917/dec.bougn.2001.01; WILSON T, 2021, DOI 10.1007/s12546-021-09255-3; LOPEZ K, 2021, DOI 10.1080/16078055.2021.1973553",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES,PUB.1148691067,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF AVEIRO;UNIVERSITY OF AVEIRO,UNIVERSITY OF AVEIRO,NA,"REGALADO F, 2022, NA","REGALADO F, 2022, NA",PORTUGAL,10.1007/978-3-031-05581-2_29,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1148691067,NA,NA,NA,"FUNDAÇÃO PARA A CIÊNCIA E TECNOLOGIA,FCT,LISBON,PORTUGAL;EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EC,BRUSSELS,BELGIUM",DIM

AFTER A YEAR OF ACTIVITY, IT IS HIGH TIME TO EVALUATE HOW EFFECTIVE IT HAS BEEN IN ITS MISSION. AT THE HIGHEST PEAK, ABOUT 22% OF THE SWISS POPULATION WAS ACTIVELY USING SWISSCOVID. THE ACTIVITY OF SWISSCOVID FOLLOWS THE CURVE ON THE NUMBER OF COVID-19 CASES. HOWEVER, PERFORMANCES ARE RATHER POOR. ABOUT 1% OF THE CASES MAY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY SWISSCOVID AND MUCH LESS THAN 2% OF SWISSCOVID ALERTS MAY HAVE BEEN USEFUL, WHILE SWISSCOVID GENERATES 5% OF THE QUARANTINES. THE MEASURE OF THE PROXIMITY OF EACH ENCOUNTER AND ITS DURATION ARE ALSO IMPRECISE. IT FURTHER COMES WITH SECURITY AND PRIVACY ISSUES: ADVERSARIES CAN INJECT FALSE ALERTS FOR SWISSCOVID USERS AND USERS CAN BE TRACKED. ON TOP OF THAT, SWISSCOVID CONTRIBUTES TO STRENGTHEN THE MONOPOLY OF APPLE AND GOOGLE AND TO MAKE USERS AND THEIR DATA CAPTIVE OF THESE GIANTS. IT ALSO DIGS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. CONTRARILY TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN, THE IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT OPEN SOURCE AND THE LAW WAS TWISTED TO FIT THE CONSTRAINTS BY APPLE AND GOOGLE.

THE MOTIVATION IS TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE THAT HELPS US ANTICIPATE OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INNOVATIVE TRANSPORT SERVICES IN ENHANCING INDEPENDENT LIVING, SOCIAL INCLUSION, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN AGEING SOCIETIES. USING THE ENGLISH LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF AGEING (ELSA), WE IDENTIFY SIX GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT DAY-TO-DAY LEISURE PRACTICES AND FIND THAT THE USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY (INTERNET USE, SMART PHONES) IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FREQUENCIES OF OUT-OF-HOME ACTIVITIES. BARRIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT INCLUDE HEALTH-RELATED RESTRICTIONS, THE SAME BARRIERS THAT ALSO PREVENT PATRONAGE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT. ALTHOUGH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY USE HAS INCREASED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, LACK OF SKILLS, ACCESS TO EQUIPMENT AND HEALTH PROBLEMS CONTRIBUTE TO A CONTINUED DIGITAL DIVIDE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE DIGITALISATION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND TRANSPORT SERVICES IS UNLIKELY TO SUPPORT INDEPENDENT LIVING FOR ALL BY ITSELF AND COULD INDEED EXACERBATE EXISTING INEQUALITIES. INSTEAD, ADDRESSING ISSUES OF EXCLUSION AMONG LESS ACTIVE, MOBILITY-RESTRICTED GROUPS REQUIRE TARGETED SERVICE DESIGNS THAT RESPOND TO DIFFERENTIAL HEALTH AND SKILLS-RELATED BARRIERS IN USING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES.","UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,UNITED KINGDOM","ZHOU R, 2014, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0089598; LUIU C, 2016, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2016.1252447; KOHONEN T, 1982, DOI 10.1007/bf00337288; BONIFACE S, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.jth.2015.05.005; KANDT J, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.tra.2015.07.008; NÄSI M, 2011, DOI 10.1007/s10433-011-0210-8; CUI J, 2016, DOI 10.1080/12265934.2016.1262785; URRY J, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.10.003; HILL R, 2015, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2015.01.062; CLEGG A, 2016, DOI 10.1093/ageing/afw039; LUCAS K, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.tranpol.2012.01.013; BEWICK V, 2005, DOI 10.1186/cc3045; ZIEGLER F, 2011, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x10000498; SIREN A, 2015, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x15000100; PACHANA N, 2016, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x16000507; LAWSON R, 1990, DOI 10.1021/ci00065a010; ZHANG Z, 2016, DOI 10.21037/atm.2016.03.35; TUKEY J, 1949, DOI 10.2307/3001913; CLARK B, 2014, DOI 10.3141/2413-06; CLARKE C, 2017, DOI 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-015839; METZ D, 2017, DOI 10.1108/s2044-994120170000010009; CHEN B, 2005, DOI 10.1109/csbw.2005.98; NIMROD G, 2018, DOI 10.1080/03601277.2018.1428145; PETERSON A, 2018, DOI 10.1002/sta4.172; JIAN M, 2018, DOI 10.7307/ptt.v30i1.2364; QUAN-HAASE A, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0002764218777572; BAKER S, 2018, DOI 10.1111/ajag.12572; BARR S, 2018, DOI 10.1002/wcc.542; KANDT J, 2018, DOI 10.1111/1467-9566.12780; MIHELJ S, 2019, DOI 10.1177/1461444818822816; RAHMAN M, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.iatssr.2019.05.004; MUSSELWHITE C, 2019, DOI 10.3390/ijerph16183327; WOOLRYCH R, 2019, DOI 10.1017/s0144686x19001569; RAMSETTY A, 2020, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocaa078; SEIFERT A, 2020, DOI 10.1080/01634372.2020.1764687; COHEN T, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.trip.2020.100133; SEIFERT A, 2020, DOI 10.1093/geronb/gbaa098; VAN JAARSVELD G, 2020, DOI 10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577427; CROTTI D, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.rtbm.2020.100591; SEN K, 2020, DOI 10.1093/geroni/igaa057.1021; DURAND A, 2021, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2021.1923584",2,2022,"TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAINS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND DESIGN; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING",PUB.1144260298,ISI,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON,NA,"CARNEY F, 2022, JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH","CARNEY F, 2022, JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH",UNITED KINGDOM,10.1016/j.jth.2021.101311,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1144260298,NA,NA,NA,"ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL,ESRC,SWINDON,UNITED KINGDOM",DIM

ONE OF THE KEYS TO SUCCESS OF THIS TRANSFORMATION, AND TO PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF DIGITAL DIVIDES, IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VARIETY OF LITERACIES. THESE LITERACIES DESCRIBE THE SUCCESS OF SOCIETY AND BUSINESS TO THRIVE IN THE DIGITAL SPACE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE INTRODUCE A NEW CONCEPT OF ACTION LITERACY (ONLINE TRUST LITERACY) AND EXAMINE ITS FUNCTIONING FROM BOTH A SOCIAL AND A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE THROUGH TWO PRIMARY RESEARCH STUDIES. AFTER DEFINING THE PHENOMENON, WE EXAMINE IT FROM TWO SIDES: THE FIRST PART EXAMINES THE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF TRUST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOCIETY (THROUGH A LARGE, REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE-BASED SURVEY), WHILE THE SECOND PART ANALYSES THE BUILDING AND OPERATIONAL MECHANISMS OF TRUST FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE (THROUGH A SMALL SAMPLE OF EXPLORATORY DATA COLLECTION). THE MAIN IMPLICATIONS OF THIS STUDY ARE TO DEMONSTRATE THE JANUS-FACED NATURE OF THIS NEW KIND OF LITERACY AND THE AMBIGUITY OF DIGITAL CULTURE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TOOLSET OF INFORMATION RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS. THE RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH IS THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW CONCEPT OF ACTION LITERACY AND ITS OPERATIONALISATION, RESULTING IN AN INTERPRETATION MATRIX.","CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST, HUNGARY","CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST,HUNGARY","PARK Y, 2011, DOI 10.1177/0093650211418338; BAWDEN D, 2001, DOI 10.1108/eum0000000007083; CHO H, 2010, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2010.02.012; JONES W, 2007, DOI 10.1002/aris.2007.1440410117; PARK D, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.038; BENABDERRAHMANE S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.bdr.2016.11.001; NG W, 2012, DOI 10.1016/j.compedu.2012.04.016; DIENLIN T, 2014, DOI 10.1002/ejsp.2049; BARUH L, 2017, DOI 10.1111/jcom.12276; BOUNEFFOUF D, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-42054-2_8; PETERSON R, 2003, DOI 10.1002/mar.10062; INGWERSEN P, 1996, DOI 10.1108/eb026960; STIGLER G, 1961, DOI 10.1086/258464; ACQUISTI A, 2005, DOI 10.1109/msp.2005.22; BARTH S, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.tele.2017.04.013; RAB Á, 2017, DOI 10.22503/inftars.xvii.2017.2.5; PORTUGAL I, 2018, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2017.12.020; CHEN H, 2018, DOI 10.1177/0002764218792691; KIM D, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2018.11.022; MENG S, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.future.2019.02.016; MAZEH I, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112858; FINKELSTEIN C, 2019, DOI 10.1080/19388071.2019.1655684; ALON L, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.chb.2020.106292; HAIDER J, 2020, DOI 10.1080/1369118x.2020.1851389; LI C, 2021, DOI 10.3390/ijerph18073501; FISCH J, 2021, DOI 10.1017/s1474747221000226",0,2022,"COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1145541672,ISI,CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST;CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST,CORVINUS UNIVERSITY OF BUDAPEST,NA,"CSERDI Z, 2022, SOCIETY AND ECONOMY","CSERDI Z, 2022, SOCIETY AND ECONOMY",HUNGARY,10.1556/204.2022.00002,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1145541672,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

IN RECENT YEARS, THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM STARTED TO MOVE IN A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE DIRECTION, INTER ALIA OFFERING MORE GREEN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. SPEEDING UP THIS PROCESS IS INEVITABLE IF HUMANITY WANTS TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) AND ACHIEVE THE TARGETS OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT. DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY (DLT) MAY ENABLE CLIMATE FINANCE TO EFFECTIVELY ACCELERATE THIS TRANSITION TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY. INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS LIKE SECURITY, IMMUTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY, AND AUDITABILITY MAKE DLT A HIGHLY PROMISING TOOL FOR CLIMATE-RELATED USE CASES. HOWEVER, THE MAINSTREAM ADOPTION OF THESE DIGITAL INNOVATIONS IS STILL CONSTRAINED BY VARIOUS OBSTACLES, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY BARRIERS, ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHLY REGULATED FINANCE SECTOR. EXISTING DIGITAL DIVIDES BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING NATIONS FURTHER EXACERBATE THESE CHALLENGES. BASED ON THESE INITIAL DELIBERATIONS, THIS CHAPTER SHOWS HOW DLT CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY FOR INNOVATIVE CLIMATE FINANCE. WE FIRST INTRODUCE THE TECHNOLOGY AND DISCUSS ITS SUSTAINABILITY AS WELL AS DIFFERENT POSSIBLE DLT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. BASED ON THIS INTRODUCTION, WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF SUSTAINABILITY-RELATED INITIATIVES AND NETWORKS LINKED TO DLT. WE REVIEW VARIOUS DLT APPLICATIONS IN DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DEFI), ASSET MANAGEMENT, MEASUREMENT, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION (MRV), TOKENIZATION, AND OTHER RELEVANT FIELDS. WE CONCLUDE WITH AN OUTLOOK ON THE ROLE OF DLT IN CLIMATE FINANCE AND PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERCOMING SOME OF THE REMAINING RISKS AND OBSTACLES.","INDEPENDENT SCHOLAR, IN DEN HEIMGÄRTEN 56, 52066, AACHEN, GERMANY, GERMANY;UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS","INDEPENDENT SCHOLAR, IN DEN HEIMGÄRTEN 56, 52066, AACHEN, GERMANY,GERMANY","MENGELKAMP E, 2017, DOI 10.1007/s00450-017-0360-9; SABERI S, 2018, DOI 10.1080/00207543.2018.1533261; ANDONI M, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2018.10.014; LIU K, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-1181-9_2; HUGHES A, 2019, DOI 10.1016/j.bushor.2019.01.002; DORFLEITNER G, 2019, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-22510-0_9; ZHOU Q, 2020, DOI 10.1109/access.2020.2967218; FRANKE L, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12031068; SMITS M, 2020, DOI 10.3389/fbloc.2020.00005; KIM S, 2020, DOI 10.3390/su12104021; KANNENGIEßER N, 2021, DOI 10.1145/3379463; SCHULZ K, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.futures.2020.102611; TREIBLMAIER H, 2020, DOI 10.3390/smartcities3030044; YOSHINO N, 2020, DOI 10.1002/ijfe.2108; POPOV S, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.jpdc.2020.09.002; MALAMAS V, 2020, DOI 10.2139/ssrn.3693638; SCHULZ K, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.esg.2020.100084; MANDAROUX R, 2021, DOI 10.3390/su13042106; SCHÄR F, 2021, DOI 10.20955/r.103.153-74; DORFLEITNER G, 2021, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2021.111378",0,2022,"LAW AND LEGAL STUDIES; COMMERCE, MANAGEMENT, TOURISM AND SERVICES; STRATEGY, MANAGEMENT AND ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR",PUB.1149154304,ISI,INDEPENDENT SCHOLAR;UNIVERSITY OF GRONINGEN,INDEPENDENT SCHOLAR,NA,"SCHLOESSER T, 2022, NA","SCHLOESSER T, 2022, NA",NETHERLANDS,10.1007/978-981-19-2662-4_13,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1149154304,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL METHODS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, AS WELL AS THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WERE USED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE RESEARCH TOPIC. IT IS FOUND THAT THE COMMUNITY-ORIENTED PRINCIPLES ARE THE BASIS FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF E-GOVERNMENT WITH A VIEW TO THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION VALUES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF E-GOVERNANCE HAS ITS OWN PECULIARITIES RELATED TO THE STATUS OF THE NATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK, INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, INFORMATION POLICY AND INFORMATION SECURITY. IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE E-GOVERNANCE SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY ELIMINATING THE DIGITAL GAP, RAISING THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL LITERACY, CREATING A SINGLE COMPETENT AUTHORITY TO REGULATE PUBLIC E-GOVERNANCE POLICY, INTRODUCING A NETWORK SYSTEM OF ACCESS TO E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES, AND ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM FOR TRAINING CIVIL SERVANTS ON THE PROVISION OF ELECTRONIC SERVICES. FURTHER RESEARCH ON E-GOVERNANCE MAY BE FOCUSED ON FOLLOW-UP STUDY AND ARGUMENTATION IN ORDER TO DETERMINE EFFECTIVE LEGAL TOOLS OF ITS REGULATION.","B.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE CONDUCTED REVIEW OF EXISTING SOURCES OF RESEARCH LITERATURE SHOWED THAT THEY HAVE FORMED AN INSUFFICIENT SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND FOR A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF DIGITAL DEPRIVATION OF SERVICES, SOCIAL CONTRADICTIONS AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT AS COMPONENTS OF TECHNOLOGICAL LEAP AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND IN THE POST-PANDEMIC PERIOD. TO FILL THE IDENTIFIED GAP IN THE SYSTEM OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, THIS WORK USES THE METHOD OF COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF STATISTICAL DATA. SOME COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD, THE EU COUNTRIES AND THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE LARGEST POPULATION AND THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION OF INVESTMENTS TO THE DIGITALIZATION OF VALUE CHAINS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIONS, WERE SELECTED AS OBJECTS FOR THIS STUDY. FINDINGS: RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT RAPID DIGITALIZATION IS IMPACTING ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE, INCLUDING NOT ONLY HOW VALUE IS CREATED AND EXCHANGED, BUT ALSO HOW WE INTERACT, OPERATE, PURCHASE AND RECEIVE SERVICES. IN THIS PROCESS, DATA AND ITS INTERNATIONAL FLOWS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT. THE USUAL DIGITAL GAP ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTIVITY, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AND WITHIN COUNTRIES IN READINESS TO USE THE POWER OF DATA, IS EXACERBATED BY WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED THE DATA GAP. COUNTRIES WITH LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO TRANSFORM DIGITAL DATA INTO DIGITAL ANALYTICS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES, AND TO USE THEM FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, ARE OBVIOUSLY AT A DISADVANTAGE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: DIGITAL DATA HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE ONE OF THE TOP STRATEGIC ASSETS FOR CREATING BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC VALUE. OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, 2015) DEPENDS A LOT ON HOW THESE DATA ARE APPLIED. THE IDEA OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AROSE, AS IT IS KNOWN, FOR OVERCOMING SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION OF SOCIETY, AND FOR THE ALIGNMENT IN THE PACE AND RESULTS OF THE TRANSITION OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES TO THE POST-INDUSTRIAL SCENARIO OF PROGRESS. THERE ARE MANY OBSTACLES ON THE PATH OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HINDER THE TRANSITION TO THIS VECTOR OF TRANSFORMATION. FIRST, THE GAP IN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES OF THE ‘GOLDEN BILLION’ AND MANY OTHER COUNTRIES HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED. SECOND, THE DIGITAL GAP CONTINUES TO DEEPEN. BUT A NEW AND EXTREMELY THREATENING DANGER ON THE PATH TO THE TRANSITION TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT HAS BECOME THE GLOBAL CRISIS CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC THAT EMERGED IN EARLY 2020 AND IS STILL ONGOING. DETERMINING THE RIGHT COURSE FOR THE FUTURE IS A DIFFICULT TASK, BUT ITS SOLUTION CANNOT BE POSTPONED. DATA ARE MULTIDIMENSIONAL, AND THEIR USE HAS AN IMPACT NOT ONLY ON TRADE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO ON HUMAN RIGHTS, PEACE AND SECURITY. IN ADDITION, MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO REDUCE THE RISK OF MISUSE AND UNAUTHORIZED USE OF DIGITAL DATA BY STATES, NON-STATES OR THE PRIVATE SECTORS TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF GLOBAL SOCIAL CONFLICT.","VYATKA STATE UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA;RECTOR OF THE ROSTOV STATE ECONOMIC UNIVERSITY, RUSSIA, RUSSIA;SOUTH RUSSIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT, RUSSIA, RUSSIA;ROSTOV STATE UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS, RUSSIA","VYATKA STATE UNIVERSITY,RUSSIA","SHILYAEVA A, 2021, DOI 10.31249/rsoc/2021.03.08",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; LIBRARY AND INFORMATION STUDIES; HUMAN SOCIETY,PUB.1150681710,ISI,VYATKA STATE UNIVERSITY;RECTOR OF THE ROSTOV STATE ECONOMIC UNIVERSITY;SOUTH RUSSIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT;ROSTOV STATE UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS,VYATKA STATE UNIVERSITY,NA,"SOZINOVA AA, 2022, NA","SOZINOVA AA, 2022, NA",RUSSIA; RUSSIA,10.1108/s1572-832320220000030006,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1150681710,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

THE BEST-KNOWN KEY INNOVATION IS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STANDARDIZED CONTAINER. THIS INNOVATION HAS BEEN THE BASIS FOR OTHER INNOVATIONS SUCH AS SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, JUST-IN-TIME DELIVERY, PORT INTEGRATION, SHIP SIZE DEVELOPMENT, AND LINKED HINTERLAND CONNECTIONS. THE BUSINESS WORLD IS ABUZZ WITH TALK ABOUT AUTOMATION, SELF-CONTROL, CLOUD LOGISTICS, ELECTRIFICATION, GREEN PROCESSES, AND DEMATERIALIZATION. HOWEVER, THE MOST IMPORTANT KEY INNOVATION NOW AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS RELATED TO DIGITALIZATION AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IS WIDELY UNDERSTOOD AS THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND SUPPORTING CAPABILITIES TO CREATE DIGITAL BUSINESS MODELS. IN THIS CONTEXT, A RETHINKING OF PREVIOUS APPROACHES TO COMMUNICATION, COORDINATION, AND COOPERATION BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS CHAPTER IS TO REFLECT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES RELATED TO THIS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, FOCUSING ON OCEAN SHIPPING, PORT MANAGEMENT, AND HINTERLAND CONNECTIVITY. THIS CHAPTER AIMS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE EXPECTATIONS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND PECULIARITIES OF THIS TRANSFORMATION, AND TO SKETCH A PICTURE OF THE FUTURE.

SCADA SYSTEMS HAVE DEVELOPED AND DIVERSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS AND PARTICULARITIES OF EACH TYPE OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS. THEY CAN USE COMBINED RADIO, SERIAL, OR MODEM CONNECTIONS. FOR LARGE LOCATIONS, ETHERNET AND IP/SONET CONNECTIONS ARE USED. SATELLITE NETWORKS ARE DESIGNED TO OFFER MOST OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED OVER LAND NETWORKS. THE DELIVERY OF SATELLITE INTERNET SERVICES IS USUALLY MADE THROUGH DIGITAL VIDEO BROADCAST STANDARDS, WHICH CAN CARRY IP DATAGRAM. SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS HAVE ALL THE NECESSARY CAPABILITIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AVOIDANCE OR DIMINUTION OF THE DIGITAL GAP, MOST OF ALL IN APPROPRIATE COMBINATIONS WITH TERRESTRIAL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES. A MAJOR ADVANTAGE OF VERY SMALL APERTURE TERMINAL NETWORKS OVER LAND NETWORKS IS THAT THEY OFFER THE POSSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING POINT-TO-MULTIPOINT CONNECTIONS, AS WELL AS A WIDE RANGE OF TRANSFER RATES, FROM 9.6KBPS TO 1.544MBPS. SCADA PROTOCOLS ARE DESIGNED TO BE VERY COMPACT, IN ORDER TO SEND INFORMATION TO THE MASTER STATION, EVEN WHEN THIS INTERROGATES THE REMOTE TERMINAL UNIT (RTU). THE MASTER STATION INCLUDES THE SERVERS, DISTRIBUTED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND RESCUE UNITS IN CASE OF DISASTERS. IN MOST DESIGN SITUATIONS, THE BANDWIDTH REQUIRED BY THE SCADA SYSTEM PROVIDER CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED SINCE THERE IS NO KNOWN ALGORITHM. IN THESE CASES, IT IS REQUIRED THAT FOR THE IMPLEMENTED SYSTEM, THE MAIN CENTRAL DISPATCHER QUERIES THE REMOTE LOCATIONS IN A CERTAIN TIME, USUALLY EXPRESSED IN SECONDS. IN THIS CHAPTER, WE CREATED AND VALIDATED A NEW ALGORITHM IN TABULAR FORM, FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE SATELLITE BANDWIDTH, USED IN DESIGNING, WHEN ADDITIONAL RTUS ARE INTRODUCED IN THE SCADA SYSTEMS. THE SCADA SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN AVAILABILITY OF 99.99%, SO THE SATELLITE BANDWIDTH WAS DIMENSIONED TO SUPPORT HIGH TRAFFIC VALUES IN SITUATIONS OF HIGH STRESS (I.E., BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHEN THE CONNECTION WITH SOME OF THE GROUND STATIONS OR ONE OF THE DISPATCH CENTERS IS LOST). IN OUR CASE STUDY, THE RESULTS OF THE MONITORING CARRIED OUT OVER A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS, AS PROVIDED BY THE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDER, WHICH INCLUDE BOTH TRAFFIC PEAKS AND THE AVERAGE TRAFFIC, VALIDATE THE DESCRIBED ALGORITHM, AND BRING TO A TRANSFER BAND OF 1MBPS.","VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF ARAD, ROMANIA;VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF ARAD, ROMANIA","VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF ARAD,ROMANIA","CANTILLO J, 2006, DOI 10.1002/sat.861; RINALDO R, 2004, DOI 10.1002/sat.789; HERRERO R, 2014, DOI 10.1145/2670386.2670387; PERROT B, 2017, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-23386-4_16; STÜBING H, 2013, DOI 10.1007/978-3-658-02531-1; STEWART L, 2011, DOI 10.1145/1943552.1943558; REZAI A, 2017, DOI 10.1016/j.jestch.2016.08.011; QIU B, 2002, DOI 10.1109/67.976986; AMOAH R, 2016, DOI 10.1109/tii.2016.2587883; LEUNG K, 2007, DOI 10.1109/tpds.2007.1011; QI X, 2016, DOI 10.1007/bf03391581; SATODA K, 2014, DOI 10.1109/iccnc.2014.6785320; EPIPHANIOU G, 2010, DOI 10.1109/ares.2010.67; ZHU B, 2011, DOI 10.1109/ithings/cpscom.2011.34; POPESCU M, 2009, DOI 10.1109/sofa.2009.5254873; IPPOLITO L, 2017, DOI 10.1002/9781119259411; TESCHL F, 2018, DOI 10.1109/csndsp.2018.8471853; CARCIOFI C, 2018, DOI 10.1109/pimrc.2018.8580923; DOBAKHSHARI A, 2019, DOI 10.1109/tpwrs.2019.2894518; USHAA S, 2019, DOI 10.1109/iciict1.2019.8741424; ABUMARSHOUD H, 2019, DOI 10.1109/vtcspring.2019.8746663; KONG Z, 2020, DOI 10.1016/j.renene.2019.07.033; AGHENTA L, 2019, DOI 10.3390/electronics8080822; ABBASPOUR A, 2019, DOI 10.1109/tie.2019.2944091; SINGH V, 2020, DOI 10.1109/lwc.2020.2963981; MARAL G, 2020, DOI 10.1002/9781119673811; SIAMAK S, 2020, DOI 10.1109/jsyst.2020.3001016",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; COMMUNICATIONS ENGINEERING; ENGINEERING,PUB.1145699648,ISI,VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF ARAD;VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF ARAD,VASILE GOLDIS WESTERN UNIVERSITY OF ARAD,NA,"POPESCU M, 2022, NA","POPESCU M, 2022, NA",ROMANIA,10.1016/b978-0-12-823978-0.00010-1,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1145699648,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM

INVESTIGATIONS INTO PRACTICE USING EVENTS, ATTENDANCE RECORDS AND REGISTERED VIEWS ARE CARRIED OUT. THE AIM IS TO IDENTIFY THE CHALLENGES AND ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO MITIGATE AGAINST THEM IN MOVING FROM PHYSICAL (FACE-TO-FACE) TO VIRTUAL (ONLINE) MODE OF OPERATIONS.   DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE SEEN A COMPLETE CHANGE IN THE WAY WE LIVE FROM LIFE AT HOME, AT WORK AND IN EDUCATION. THIS HAS IMPACTED THE WAY PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS NOW CONDUCT BUSINESS INCLUDING THE NEED TO REVISE WAYS OF UPSKILLING AND SUSTAINING PRACTICE. CORE TO ALL OF THIS IS THE ROLE OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION FOR ALL PERSONS IN ALL WORKS OF LIFE. THE CURRENT STUDY FOCUSSES ON PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES AND SUPPORT PROVIDED TO MEMBERS OF BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY (BCS), THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT. THE AUTHORS EXAMINE THE EVENTS PROVIDED, THE CONDUCT SUPPORT PROVIDED TO MEMBERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE METHOD INCLUDES USE OF SURVEYS OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND ANALYSIS OF DATA OBTAINED.   FINDINGS THE ONSET OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC WAS PERCEIVED AS A REAL SHOCK FOR EVERYONE EVERYWHERE. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, FACED WITH THE REALITY OF HAVING TO DO EVERYONE ONLINE, THE CURRENT STUDY FOUND THAT THERE WERE OBSERVED INCREASED IN THE NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES OF PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS WORLDWIDE. MOST INTERESTING IS THAT FACT THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THESE EVENTS WAS FOUND TO BE INCREASING USING E-LEARNING AND OTHER ASSOCIATED ONLINE TOOLS AND RESOURCES. PARTICIPANTS OF THESE EVENTS WERE NO LONGER RESTRICTED TO LOCAL MEMBERS BUT WIDESPREAD GLOBALLY. THERE WAS THE APPETITE FOR MORE EVENTS TO BE PUT UP AND WILLINGNESS FOR MORE INDIVIDUAL AND GROUPS TO VOLUNTEER AND/OR PARTICIPATE.   RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS THE LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT STUDY ARE THAT ONLY A FEW OF THE MANY ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THIS ONE PROFESSIONAL BODY, BCS, THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT. THE FACT THAT MORE EVENTS ARE NOW BEING CARRIED OUT FOR THE MANY GROUPS AND BRANCHES IMPLIES A LOT MORE DIGITAL DATA WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER STUDY TO INFORM DEVELOPMENTS OF MEMBERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.   PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS A HUGE AND EVOLVING. IT REMAINS AND PRESENTS A COMPLICATED CASE FOR THE WORLD TO DEAL WITH. AMONGST THE MANY REALITIES IS THAT LIVING LIFE ONLINE HAS BECOME A NEW NORMAL AND ONE EVERYBODY MUST LEARN TO ADJUST TO. PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE BCS WOULD NEED TO THINK OF NOT ONLY THEIR MEMBERS BUT ALSO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND HOW WELL SOCIETY AND BUSINESS CAN BE SUSTAINED GOING FORWARD. THIS INVOLVES CONSIDERING DEVELOPMENTS OF EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND APPROPRIATE PLATFORMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND THE VOLUNTARY SECTORS IN SOCIETY.   SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS DUE TO RESTRICTED PHYSICAL (FACE-TO-FACE) INTERACTIONS, PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED PROCESSES WOULD REQUIRE REVIEWING. NEW INFORMED POLICIES WOULD NEED TO BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED BY PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS ON REVISED PRACTICES RESULTING FROM IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. THE EMANATING GLOBAL PARTICIPATION FROM LOCAL ACTIVITIES PRESENTS CHALLENGES INVOLVING TIME, SPACE (GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION) AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THAT EXISTS IN SOCIETY AND ACCESS TO THE FAST AND RELIABLE INTERNET SERVICES ARE ALSO WORTH CONSIDERING.   ORIGINALITY/VALUE THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE APPLIED TO EDUCATION AND BUSINESS IS IMPORTANT IN THE FACE OF THE MANY AND VARIED CHALLENGES EVERYONE IS FACING EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THIS HAS BEEN INTENSE AT HOME AND AT WORK GLOBALLY. ALTHOUGH THE TRUE CAUSE IS YET TO BE ESTABLISHED, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WAYS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES AND CONTINUE WITH LIFE ARE FOUND AND IMPLEMENTED. THIS PAPER ESTABLISHES SOME OF THE IMPACTS AND PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE USEFUL IN FORGING AHEAD FOR PEOPLE IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSION.","UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER, UNITED KINGDOM;UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER, UNITED KINGDOM;BCS — THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT, UNITED KINGDOM;BCS — THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT, UNITED KINGDOM;BCS — THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT, UNITED KINGDOM","UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER,UNITED KINGDOM","PINA E CUNHA M, 1999, DOI 10.1111/1468-2370.00017; SOMMER S, 2015, DOI 10.1177/1059601115578027; HADIDA A, 2014, DOI 10.1111/ijmr.12047; HARLAND L, 2005, DOI 10.1177/107179190501100202; GOTTLIEB M, 2020, DOI 10.1097/ceh.0000000000000310; FOSS N, 2020, DOI 10.1111/joms.12643; CIUCHTA M, 2020, DOI 10.1177/0149206320966987",0,2022,INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCES; APPLIED COMPUTING; INFORMATION SYSTEMS,PUB.1151958156,ISI,UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER;UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER;BCS — THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT;BCS — THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT;BCS — THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE FOR IT,UNIVERSITY OF ULSTER,NA,"UHOMOIBHI J, 2022, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY","UHOMOIBHI J, 2022, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND LEARNING TECHNOLOGY",UNITED KINGDOM; UNITED KINGDOM,10.1108/ijilt-05-2022-0098,HTTPS://APP.DIMENSIONS.AI/DETAILS/PUBLICATION/PUB.1151958156,NA,NA,NA,NA,DIM
