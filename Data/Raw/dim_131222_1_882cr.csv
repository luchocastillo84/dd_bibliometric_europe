pub.1077130253,,Disseminating relevant health information to underserved audiences: implications of the Digital Divide Pilot Projects.,"OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the influence of the digital divide on disparities in health outcomes for vulnerable populations, identifying implications for medical and public libraries. METHOD: The paper describes the results of the Digital Divide Pilot Projects demonstration research programs funded by the National Cancer Institute to test new strategies for disseminating relevant health information to underserved and at-risk audiences. RESULTS: The Digital Divide Pilot Projects field-tested innovative systemic strategies for helping underserved populations access and utilize relevant health information to make informed health-related decisions about seeking appropriate health care and support, resisting avoidable and significant health risks, and promoting their own health. IMPLICATIONS: The paper builds on the Digital Divide Pilot Projects by identifying implications for developing health communication strategies that libraries can adopt to provide digital health information to vulnerable populations.",Journal of the Medical Library Association,2005,93,4 Suppl,s68-73,"Kreps, Gary L",George Mason University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077130253,64,"[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

pub.1077363801,10.1109/iembs.2004.1403868,Modeling Telehealth and Telemedicine: A Global Geosociopolitical Perspective,"Telehealth and telemedicine can encompass many applications including direct patient care, training, supervision, consultation, continuing education, and consumer health. The field uses an array of technology from the simplest telephony to advanced robotics. Therefore, it is important to work from a model in design or implementation. This rapidly changing and sometimes chaotic environment presents engineers with a unique opportunity to address the digital divide that is reflective of the geosociopolitical makeup of the world economy. The paper begins a developmental perspective of service delivery models currently used, likening the early years to a feudal system and the current time to a mosaic. After a brief look at the digital divide and the role of culture in technology, the paper concludes with application examples from projects around the world and suggests ways that model systems can be designed with various levels of technology.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC),2004,2,,3072-3075,"Stamm, B Hudnall",Idaho State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077363801,2,"[Weik, Martin H.]|[]|Computer Science and Communications Dictionary|2000|||824-824|10.1007/1-4020-0613-6_9447|pub.1006817335|20;[STAMM, B.

For this, the concept of the Grid should be integrated with other communication networks and platforms. A promising approach is the implementation of service-oriented architectures for an invisible grid, hiding complexity for both application developers and end-users. Therefore integrated Grid Tools Suites for application programmers must be developed.

Pre-operative planning, intra-operative navigation and minimally-invasive surgery require a digital and virtual environment supporting the perception of the physician. As data and computing resources in a virtual hospital are distributed over many sites the concept of the Grid should be integrated with other communication networks and platforms. A promising approach is the implementation of service-oriented architectures for an invisible grid, hiding complexity for both application developers and end-users. Examples of promising medical applications of Grid technology are the real-time 3D-visualization and manipulation of patient data for individualized treatment planning and the creation of distributed intelligent databases of medical images.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2006,121,,168-75,"Graschew, Georgi; Roelofs, Theo A; Rakowsky, Stefan; Schlag, Peter M; Heinzlreiter, Paul; Kranzlmüller, Dieter; Volkert, Jens",Charité - University Medicine Berlin,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077321028,21,

This paper describes the REmote Patient Education in a Telemedicine Environment (REPETE) system, a component of the IDEATel telemedicine architecture. The REPETE architecture supports simultaneous visual and audio teaching modes over low bandwidth connections. This paper presents an in-depth qualitative analysis of two patients being trained to use the IDEATel patient web portal. The results indicate that this method of instruction was useful in facilitating patients' use of the web application. However, the observations suggest that there is learning curve for the trainer to use the resources effectively to establish common ground and foster competencies in the patient.",AMIA Annual Symposium Proceedings,2006,2006,,459-63,"Lai, Albert M; Kaufman, David R; Starren, Justin",Columbia University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1077353985,7,"[Shea, Steven; Starren, Justin; Weinstock, Ruth S.; Knudson, Paul E.; Teresi, Jeanne; Holmes, Douglas; Palmas, Walter; Field, Lesley; Goland, Robin; Tuck, Catherine; Hripcsak, George; Capps, Linnea; Liss, David]|[ur.07472701777.16; ur.01341566416.40; ur.01313332511.08; ur.0747335613.49; ur.01264607567.53; ur.01171500364.50; ur.01050352414.35; ur.01251235105.12; ur.01146361662.06; ur.01177473022.88; ur.01304304572.48; ur.01323211405.50; ]|Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|2002|9|1|49-62|10.1136/jamia.2002.0090049|pub.1011779679|145"

This report describes the first year of work on this collaborative effort between the University of Washington (Seattle) Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia and Universidad Nacional de San Marcos (Peru) OBJECTIVES: To describe activities in the first year of a new International Research and Training Program in Biomedical and Health Informatics. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of key activities including an assessment of electronic environment through observation and survey, an in country short course with quantitative evaluation, and first round of recruitment of Peruvian scholars for long-term training in Seattle. RESULTS: A two-week short course on informatics was held in the country. Participants' success in learning was demonstrated through pretest/posttest. A systematic assessment of electronic environment in Peru was carried out and two scholars for long-term training were enrolled at the University of Washington, Seattle. DISCUSSION: Initial activity in the collaborative training effort has been high.

Participants included 140 children, mostly 13-year-old African American (83%) boys (58%), living in single-parent households (75%) where the median annual income was $15,000 (USD). This report focuses on children's Internet activities, socio-demographic characteristics related to their Internet activities, and the relationship between academic performance and Internet activities. Overall, findings indicate that low-income children initially use the Internet primarily for entertainment. As home Internet use loses its novelty children become more focused in their Internet activities, reducing the number of websites they visit and visiting more websites targeted to their specific interests. Pornography websites are popular initially, especially among boys, but their popularity decreases dramatically after 3 months. Age, race, and sex have little influence on which websites are most popular. Academic performance predicts subsequent Internet activities, and Internet activities predict subsequent academic performance. Directions for future research to identify mechanisms that mediate the relationship between Internet activities and academic performance and implications for the digital divide are discussed.",Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking,2007,10,2,182-190,"Jackson, Linda A.; Samona, Ricky; Moomaw, Jeff; Ramsay, Lauren; Murray, Christopher; Smith, Amy; Murray, Lindsay",Michigan State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1059246934,33,"[Rocheleau, Bruce]|[ur.014641540015.50]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1995|12|1|1-17|10.2190/mhur-4fc9-b187-t8h4|pub.1003843218|68;[Blanton, William E.; Moorman, Gary B.; Hayes, Bobbie A.; Warner, Mark L.]|[ur.07677031305.23; ur.016402102505.59; ; ]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1997|16|4|371-396|10.2190/0yaw-fyan-2t2b-0lp3|pub.1006029705|45;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Biocca, Frank; Zhao, Yong; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.01253317563.89; ur.014637772363.10; ur.01271544433.04; ur.0662366733.26]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|2003|59|3|355-382|10.1016/s1071-5819(03)00069-7|pub.1006879595|34;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Biocca, Frank A.; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Zhao, Yong; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.014637772363.10; ur.01253317563.89; ur.01271544433.04; ur.0662366733.26]|Developmental Psychology|2006|42|3|429-435|10.1037/0012-1649.42.3.429|pub.1008890465|177;[Gross, Elisheva F.]|[ur.012303177773.77]|Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|2004|25|6|633-649|10.1016/j.appdev.2004.09.005|pub.1008892976|517;[VALKENBURG, PATTI M.; SOETERS, KAREN E.]|[ur.0576733304.14; ur.015100504111.50]|Communication Research|2001|28|5|652-675|10.1177/009365001028005004|pub.1009965313|73;[Kraut, Robert; Scherlis, William; Mukhopadhyay, Tridas; Manning, Jane; Kiesler, Sara]|[ur.01065212052.21; ur.010534440251.33; ur.01263333020.18; ur.013513232455.43; ur.01345706760.32]|Communications of the ACM|1996|39|12|55-63|10.1145/240483.240493|pub.1010821654|162;[Jackson, Linda A.; Ervin, Kelly S.; Gardner, Philip D.; Schmitt, Neal]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.011064071572.45; ur.016623651305.19; ur.015030215226.46]|Journal of Applied Social Psychology|2001|31|10|2019-2046|10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00162.x|pub.1018476267|52;[Jackson, Linda A.; Ervin, Kelly S.; Gardner, Philip D.; Schmitt, Neal]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.011064071572.45; ur.016623651305.19; ur.015030215226.46]|Sex Roles|2001|44|5-6|363-379|10.1023/a:1010937901821|pub.1019455801|408;[Subrahmanyam, Kaveri; Greenfield, Patricia; Kraut, Robert; Gross, Elisheva]|[ur.01232162315.96; ur.01150276321.12; ur.01065212052.21; ur.012303177773.77]|Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology|2001|22|1|7-30|10.1016/s0193-3973(00)00063-0|pub.1019917353|328;[Facer, Keri; Furlong, Ruth]|[ur.01221066300.33; ur.010506710607.53]|Journal of Youth Studies|2001|4|4|451-469|10.1080/13676260120101905|pub.1036471466|113;[Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Biocca, Frank A.; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.; Zhao, Yong]|[ur.01070755763.48; ur.01042557654.26; ur.014637772363.10; ur.01253317563.89; ur.0662366733.26; ur.01271544433.04]|Swiss Journal of Psychology|2003|62|2|79-90|10.1024//1421-0185.62.2.79|pub.1056313272|35;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|278;[Subrahmanyam, K; Kraut, R E; Greenfield, P M; Gross, E F]|[ur.01232162315.96; ur.01065212052.21; ur.01150276321.12; ur.012303177773.77]|The Future of Children|2000|10|2|123-44|10.2307/1602692|pub.1069561094|263"
pub.1074760150,,The ten deadly mistakes of wanna-dots.,"Increasingly, it seems, there are just two types of companies left in the world: dot-coms, born on the Internet, and ""wanna-dots,"" established organizations that are seeking to incorporate the Internet into their businesses. Some wanna-dots manage the deep mind-shift required to cross the digital divide. These are the pacesetters--the first movers and fast followers that exhibit organizational curiosity and the desire to innovate. But most wanna-dots are laggards; they don't rise to the challenge with the same resolve. In a global research effort involving more than 800 companies, the author uncovered so many wanna-dots making the same kinds of mistakes that it almost seemed they were following a How Not to Change guide. In this article, Kanter creates just such a guide, offering ten pieces of antiadvice that expose the tendency of wanna-dots to make only cosmetic changes when deep transformation is required. Beyond delineating what not to do, Kanter serves up two examples of wanna-dots that got it right. First, Williams-Sonoma, which successfully made up for a slow start to create a strong Web presence. Second, Honeywell, a pacesetter led by e-believers from the start, which still found the road to the Web a challenging one. For companies not born digital, the fundamental problem is change. And the real place to look for change is not on the Internet but inside your company--at your own organizational culture and your attitude toward change.",Harvard Business Review,2001,79,1,"91-100, 175","Kanter, R M",Harvard University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1074760150,22,

METHODS: We conducted a bibliographical research over the past five years and distinguished between international and French studies. RESULTS: For a long time, the (mostly US) studies have been merely descriptive. The studies highlight that the factors associated with health searches on the Internet are similar to the factors underlying the digital divide. Consumer searches are deemed efficient although search skills are comparatively below standard. Attempts are underway to set up tools, circulate them widely, and ensure better quality information on the Internet. However, comprehension and literacy are still issues in some social groups. Regarding the impact on consumer health per se, a (positive) effect of the Internet seems to emerge but research should be continued. CONCLUSION: Many of the behaviors, uses or limits addressed in this paper pertain to any information search on the Internet but other problems or differences also occur in the specific area of health. Longitudinal investigations are needed, specifically to gain deeper insight into the impacts we have addressed, while rolling out a comprehensive approach to the temporal evolution of user practices and experiences. Specifically, the central issue is still to determine how (and for whom) the Internet alters information search behaviors and, in fine, to what extent this affects health behaviors and the recourse to healthcare.",Revue d'Epidémiologie et de Santé Publique,2006,54,3,263-275,"Renahy, E.;

pub.1003333527,10.1197/jamia.m1341,Is There a Digital Divide among Physicians? A Geographic Analysis of Information Technology in Southern California Physician Offices,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether physician offices located in high-minority and low-income neighborhoods have different levels of access to information technology than offices located in lower-minority and higher-income areas. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of pediatrics, family medicine, and general practice offices in Orange County, California. Survey data were linked with community demographic data from the 2000 Census using a geographical information system. RESULTS: Of 307 offices surveyed, 141 responded (46%). Offices located in high-minority and high-poverty areas were as likely to respond as other offices. Among responding offices, 94% had a computer, 77% had Web access, 29% had broadband Internet access, and 53% used computerized scheduling and billing systems. Offices located in minority and low-income communities had equivalent access to each technology. Offices in communities with larger proportions of Hispanics were less likely to have practice Web pages, but other uses of the Internet were not associated with practice location. Offices reported high levels of interest in online clinical systems but also high levels of concern about these systems' usability and confidentiality. Offices with Web access and those with practice management systems expressed greater interest in online clinical systems but also greater levels of concern about usability and confidentiality. These attitudes were equivalent among offices in different communities. CONCLUSION: Primary care offices located in poor and minority communities in a large, suburban county had high levels of access to and interest in Web-based systems.

Digital divide widens as the information society matures. It has been generally argued that digital divide is caused by individual characteristic differences: gender, generation, education, income, labor force status, class, region and etc. But digital divide is created, reproduced and aggravated through a very complex process. Given the assumption that digital divide is not a comprehensive concept converging into a single dimension, digital divide are articulated into the following four aspects: digital consciousness, digital accessibility, digital ability, digital usage. The empirical result indicates that (1)digital gap among residents were varied according to individual characteristic differences and digital divide type; (2)the result of the path analysis shows that digital ability and digital usage in digital divide factors affected significantly service quality and subjective performance; (3)digital consciousness, digital accessibility, digital ability, digital usage in digital divide factors were significant factor; (4)digital ability and digital usage were the most important factors, whereas digital consciousness is the least important factor in administrative information service. Finally, The prior conditions for the solution of digital divide are to draw upon a social consensus in order to provide more people with more information. In addition, it is necessary to devise relevant digital education content according to individual characteristic differences, and policy measures need to be taken to not simply enhance digital availability but to improve communicative competence.",The Korean Governance Review,2007,14,2,28-58,"Wu, Yangho; Chung, Myung-Ju",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047357032,1,
pub.1030006859,10.1016/j.compmedimag.2006.09.014,Assessment of Internet-based tele-medicine in Africa (the RAFT project),"The objectives of this paper on the Réseau Afrique Francophone de Télémédecine (RAFT) project are the evaluation of feasibility, potential, problems and risks of an Internet-based tele-medicine network in developing countries of Africa. The RAFT project was started in Western African countries 5 years ago and has now extended to other regions of Africa as well (i.e. Madagascar, Rwanda). A project for the development of a national tele-medicine network in Mali was initiated in 2001, extended to Mauritania in 2002 and to Morocco in 2003. By 2006, a total of nine countries are connected. The entire technical infrastructure is based on Internet technologies for medical distance learning and tele-consultations. The results are a tele-medicine network that has been in productive use for over 5 years and has enabled various collaboration channels, including North-to-South (from Europe to Africa), South-to-South (within Africa), and South-to-North (from Africa to Europe) distance learning and tele-consultations, plus many personal exchanges between the participating hospitals and Universities. It has also unveiled a set of potential problems: (a) the limited importance of North-to-South collaborations when there are major differences in the available resources or the socio-cultural contexts between the collaborating parties; (b) the risk of an induced digital divide if the periphery of the health system in developing countries is not involved in the development of the network; and (c) the need for the development of local medical content management skills. Particularly point (c) is improved through the collaboration between the various countries as professionals from the medical and the computer science field are sharing courses and resources. Personal exchanges between partners in the project are frequent, and several persons received an education at one of the partner Universities. As conclusion, we can say that the identified risks have to be taken into account when designing large-scale tele-medicine projects in developing countries. These problems can be mitigated by fostering South-South collaboration channels, by the use of satellite-based Internet connectivity in remote areas, the appreciation of local knowledge and its publication on-line. The availability of such an infrastructure also facilitates the development of other projects, courses, and local content creation.",Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics,2006,30,6-7,407-416,"Bagayoko, Cheick Oumar; Müller, Henning; Geissbuhler, Antoine",University Hospital of Geneva,Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030006859,42,"[Brauchli, Kurt; Oberholzer, Martin]|[ur.01227710432.20; ur.01360701342.77]|Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare|2005|11|2_suppl|3-7|10.1258/135763305775124795|pub.1002177808|40;[Ganapathy, K]|[ur.0752734432.41]|World Neurosurgery|2002|58|6|388-394|10.1016/s0090-3019(02)00924-2|pub.1003432229|30;[Oberholzer, M.; Christen, H.; Haroske, G.; Helfrich, M.; Oberli, H.; Jundt, G.; Stauch, G.; Mihatsch, M.; Brauchli, K.]|[ur.01360701342.77; ur.01312566142.86; ur.01000337762.96; ur.01253151743.14; ur.0777233432.63; ur.01174442266.96; ur.01113462032.61; ur.013571103157.06; ur.01227710432.20]|Current Problems in Dermatology|2003|32||102-114|10.1159/000067381|pub.1023507768|18;[Sarbadhikari, Suptendra Nath]|[ur.01371225501.74]|Journal of Medical Systems|2005|29|2|125-141|10.1007/s10916-005-3001-y|pub.1029329740|15;[Graham, L E; Zimmerman, M; Vassallo, D J; Patterson, V; Swinfen, P; Swinfen, R; Wootton, R]|[ur.01137463731.82; ; ur.01040205161.60; ur.014455421164.68; ur.0605547312.21; ur.01112161461.51; ur.0706274772.99]|Tropical Doctor|2003|33|1|36-38|10.1177/004947550303300118|pub.1036881619|50;[Engelmann, U; Schröter, A; Baur, U; Werner, O; Schwab, M; Müller, H; Meinzer, H P]|[ur.01202062030.92; ur.01170017067.62; ur.0773012543.83; ur.01041125743.55; ur.0722255471.17; ur.07552063233.67; ur.013024406155.66]|IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics|1998|2|1|20-25|10.1109/4233.678530|pub.1061171202|17;[Brauchli, K; O'mahony, D; Banach, L; Oberholzer, M]|[ur.01227710432.20; ur.011022546657.02; ur.01253550136.64; ur.01360701342.77]|Studies in health technology and informatics|2005|114||11-7||pub.1077058975|32;[Zolfo, Maria; Arnould, Line; Huyst, Veerle; Lynen, Lut]|[ur.01057146406.02; ur.01137347175.84; ur.01277225564.07; ur.011702421474.25]|Studies in health technology and informatics|2005|114||18-22||pub.1077058976|12;[Suri, Jasjit S; Dowling, Alan; Laxminarayan, Swamy; Singh, Sameer]|[ur.01227046462.13; ; ur.01202407014.09; ur.016226223304.32]|Studies in health technology and informatics|2005|114||140-56||pub.1077058993|5;[Kienzle, M; Curry, D; Franken, E A; Galvin, J; Hoffman, E; Holtum, E; Shope, L; Torner, J; Wakefield, D]|[ur.0575644321.39; ur.01231365716.76; ur.01041760146.01; ur.01113003403.43; ur.016425036417.05; ur.01277501116.32; ; ; ur.012377101657.30]|Journal of the Medical Library Association|1995|83|1|37-41||pub.1082472711|12;[Wright, D]|[]|Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare|1998|4 Suppl 2||1-85||pub.1083282017|31;[Meystre, S; Müller, H]|[; ]|Swiss Medical Informatics|2005|21|55|3-15|10.4414/smi.21.00082|pub.1103778152|6"

Then it focuses on the practice of Guizhou Province to bridge the digital divide ---- the practice and experience of GZNW. The final section gives a series of policy recommendations on how to bridge the digital divide, realize digital dividends, and how to build a new socialist countryside.",Data Science Journal,2007,6,,s941,"Jing, Linbo",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1032148595,0,
pub.1063872605,10.1177/0894439306286852,A Disappearing Digital Divide Among College Students?,"Given debate about the existence of a digital divide in the United States, the question remains: If individuals are in situations where all have access to the Internet (e.g., a university), will aspects of a digital divide still exist? The authors examine whether a racial digital divide exists among college students in the odds of their using the Internet and the different levels and types of usage. Data are from a random sample of full-time, residential college freshmen. Results indicate that aspects of a digital divide exist in terms of whether one uses the Internet for specific purposes; however, once individuals begin using the Internet, few racial differences exist. Internet experience and gender affect particular types of Internet usage, suggesting that the digital divide is multilayered. A policy implication from this study is that bringing individuals into structured environments with assured access may help to decrease aspects of the digital divide.",Social Science Computer Review,2006,24,4,497-506,"Cotten, Shelia R.; Jelenewicz, Shameeka M.",University of Alabama at Birmingham,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063872605,53,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|656;[Anderson, K J]|[]|Journal of American College Health|2001|50|1|21-26|10.1080/07448480109595707|pub.1004989458|223;[Wilson, Kenneth R.; Wallin, Jennifer S.; Reiser, Christa]|[; ; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2003|21|2|133-143|10.1177/0894439303021002001|pub.1015934109|136;[Morse, Timothy E.]|[]|Education and Urban Society|2004|36|3|266-279|10.1177/0013124504264103|pub.1023875053|20;[Rigotti, N A; Lee, J E; Wechsler, H]|[ur.01316235474.08; ; ur.0667424510.76]|JAMA|2000|284|6|699-705|10.1001/jama.284.6.699|pub.1034405315|420;[Slate, John R.; Manuel, Margaret; Brinson, Kenneth H.]|[; ; ur.015703303313.77]|Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education|2002|27|1|75-93|10.1080/02602930120105081|pub.1047826846|32;[Bonebrake, Katie]|[]|Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking|2002|5|6|551-557|10.1089/109493102321018196|pub.1059210385|67;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.; Schlosser, Ann]|[; ; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|3|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00341.x|pub.1061923611|137;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|278;[Brown, Monica R.; Higgins, Kyle; Hartley, Kendall]|[; ; ur.0670106427.81]|Teaching Exceptional Children|2001|33|4|32-39|10.1177/004005990103300405|pub.1063689041|16;[Crews, Mike; Feinberg, Martin]|[; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2002|20|2|116-123|10.1177/089443930202000202|pub.1063872467|9;[Shelley, Mack; Thrane, Lisa; Shulman, Stuart; Lang, Evette; Beisser, Sally; Larson, Teresa; Mutiti, James]|[ur.01267601700.10; ur.01277414401.35; ur.01111650500.36; ; ur.014214030103.48; ur.016334447415.77; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2004|22|2|256-269|10.1177/0894439303262580|pub.1063872540|66;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|999;[Davison, Elizabeth; Cotten, Shelia]|[; ur.011516045427.40]|First Monday|2003|8|3||10.5210/fm.v8i3.1039|pub.1072710833|50;[Hertel, James B.]|[ur.016637300733.80]|The Psychological Record|2002|52|1|3-18|10.1007/bf03395411|pub.1090370016|38"

pub.1028042411,10.3923/itj.2007.166.173,Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: Overcoming the Digital Divide,"In an increasingly digitalized world economy, there exists a digital gap between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world that translates into economic marginalization of the African region. Consequently, the following phases of development are crucial for the region: (1) the phase of massive digitalization during which the digital divide is bridged and (2) the phase of information and knowledge management in which information is systematically converted into knowledge and the latter into innovative-sustainable development. Information for conversion into knowledge is supplied by the first phase. The second phase is therefore existence dependent on the first. Therefore, the attainment of digitalized state is primary-sine qua non. The envisaged digitalized state can be actualized and consolidated with a combination of: (a) curriculum in computer education consisting of computer taxonomy, networking and ICTS in general for secondary and tertiary institutions but also aptly adoptable for informal groups and (b) establishment of multipurpose telecentres in rural areas and a diffusion of networks in urban centres. Once a steady digitalized state evidenced by uninterrupted connectivity to the internet is attained, the second phase can be realized. Without steady supply of electricity, however, sustainable development and competitive edge may be hard to come by in a world of fierce competition.",Information Technology Journal,2007,6,2,166-173,"Agbeja, Oyedokun; Salawu, R.O.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028042411,1,"[Kobrin, Stephen J.]|[]|The Globalization of Multinational Enterprise Activity and Economic Development|2000|||133-154|10.1057/9780230599161_6|pub.1000096309|22;[Stulz, René M.]|[ur.015317367271.10]|Journal of Applied Corporate Finance|1995|8|3|30-38|10.1111/j.1745-6622.1995.tb00634.x|pub.1047664863|65"

An overview of research published in the last 20 years draws to the conclusion that females are at a disadvantage relative to men when learning about computers or learning other material with the aid of computer‐assisted software. The evidence shows that the digital divide affects people of all ages and across international boundaries. We suggest that the digital divide is fundamentally a problem of computer anxiety whose roots are deep in socialization patterns of boys and girls and that interact with the stereotype of computers as toys for boys. A model of the digital divide is presented that examines gender stereotypes, attribution patterns, and stereotype threat as antecedents of computer anxiety. Computer anxiety in turn leads to differences in computer attitudes and computer performance. A number of suggestions are offered to reduce the impact of the digital divide.",Journal of Computer Assisted Learning,2006,22,5,320-334,"Cooper, J.",Princeton University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003274987,299,"[Mitra, Ananda;

pub.1046538258,10.1002/meet.1450420166,Consumer health digital divide: A research agenda for studying inequality in online health information access and use,"Driven by social, economic, academic and technological forces, the new field of E-health has been developing quickly in recent years. Many E-health applications are Internet-based and therefore have the potential to help people throughout the world. However, this high dependence on the Internet also raises sobering questions about a health digital divide, i.e. unequal access and use as well as unequal rights to gain benefits of online information among health consumers. In this paper, we discuss social, cultural and economic factors which shape a research agenda for examining health digital divide issues. These factors are derived by means of a literature review. Future research questions include how to solve the discrepancies between health digital divide and digital divide among the general population, what is the role of content prejudice in health digital divide, and what is the status quo of health digital divide in developing countries, et al.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2006,42,1,n/a-n/a,"Chong, Jing",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046538258,0,"[Hanauer, David; Dibble, Emily; Fortin, Jennifer; Col, Nananda F]|[ur.0753537546.10; ur.01264762204.35; ur.0742621044.84; ur.0625641250.34]|Journal of American College Health|2004|52|5|197-202|10.3200/jach.52.5.197-202|pub.1000898407|75;[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

The authors answer this question by personally authenticating the dramatic state of the digital divide via their own experience. First, the authors will define “digital divide. Second, justification will be given to the significance of the issue. Third, with citation of research literature, the authors will substantiate the gravity of digital divide in our world. Finally, adducing their own personal experience, the authors intend to clinch the point that the digital divide is not distant and impersonal, a concern of someone else, but close, real, and very personal.

pub.1018124043,10.1108/02640470510631308,Bridging the digital divide through e‐governance,"Purpose The paper aims to present the status of the digital divide in Africa and the implications for libraries, and to demonstrate that, contrary to recent published findings, the digital divide is not narrowing.   Design/methodology/approach A general literature review is undertaken, along with a case study of the digital divide in an academic setting.   Findings Africa still suffers from rampant poverty, and consequently resources that could be utilised to bridge the digital divide are directed at meeting peoples basic survival needs, including food, shelter, health care, housing, etc. Additionally, governments are increasingly adopting e‐government initiatives that libraries could explore for automation.   Research limitations/implications More research is needed to show why – given that the gap between rich and poor countries is increasing, and that economic development is a good predictor of ICT uptake – that the digital divide between developed and developing countries is claimed to be narrowing.   Practical implications Libraries have the potential to use e‐government initiatives for automation, but they need to exert influence on their governments through advocacy and other measures.   Originality/value Few studies, especially in Africa, have explored the potential of e‐governance for library automation. Similarly, issues of the digital divide have in the past been looked at largely from international and national perspectives, with little attention being paid to the existence of the phenomenon within libraries. Finally, existing studies on the digital divide largely use ICT metrics without paying much attention to the totality of other variables that influence the digital divide. This paper provides a proposal on how e‐governance could be used to narrow the digital divide within libraries in Africa.",The Electronic Library,2005,23,5,591-602,"Mutula, Stephen M.",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018124043,24,"[Miller, Chris]|[]|AfP|2002|31|9|792||pub.1075181232|1"

However, few or none of the previous researches have taken into account both domestic and international digital divide issues at the same time and offered an integrated view to structurally illustrate these issues from various aspects. The goal of this paper is to propose an integrated framework for assessing and analyzing domestic and international digital divides of a country or a group of countries. Situations of digital divides in Taiwan, three other industrialized economies in southeastern Asia, and four northern European countries are examined and compared based on the framework. Related e-government strategies for bridging the divides are also discussed.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2004,3183,,293-299,"Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I",National Chengchi University,Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043729182,4,"[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|88;[Servaes, Jan; Heinderyckx, Francois]|[ur.010751772465.57; ur.012733526033.47]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|2|91-115|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00008-9|pub.1002551163|19;[Lu, Ming-te]|[ur.015276504143.90]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2001|4|3|1-4|10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304|pub.1012019015|45;[Kim, Mun-Cho; Kim, Jong-Kil]|[ur.010401355771.29; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2001|2105||78-91|10.1007/3-540-47749-7_6|pub.1026084170|32;[Jalava, Jukka; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012713076467.26; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|189-210|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x|pub.1026761325|143;[Iyer, Lakshmi S.; Taube, Larry; Raquet, Julia]|[ur.07566015351.69; ; ]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2002|5|1|43-68|10.1080/1097198x.2002.10856319|pub.1029436209|13;[Adams, Owen]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|2000|27|2|245-246|10.1016/s1352-0237(00)00138-6|pub.1048829755|18;[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.011256716263.36; ur.015022300133.21]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|1|9-19|10.1080/02683960210132061|pub.1058311977|118;[Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I]|[; ]|Electronic Government an International Journal|2004|1|2|179|10.1504/eg.2004.005177|pub.1067427450|8;[Brown, Cheryl L.]|[]|Proceedings of the 35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|2002|||10-19|10.1109/hicss.2002.994085|pub.1093299697|7"
pub.1002642735,10.1080/01972240600904076,Methodological Challenges of Digital Divide Measurements,"The term “digital divide” has been used for almost a decade and typically relates to sociodemographic differences in the use of information and communication technology. However, the corresponding measurement is still relatively imprecise. Very often it is simply reduced to comparisons of Internet penetration rates. This article extends the measurements above the usual bivariate comparisons. Within this context, three essential approaches are presented and critically evaluated. First, loglinear modeling is used to address the interactions among the factors affecting the digital divide. Second, compound measures (i.e., the Digital Divide Index) that integrate a number of variables into a single indicator are discussed. Third, time-distance methodology is applied to analyze changes in the digital divide. The article argues that these approaches often yield entirely different conclusions compared to simple bivariate analysis. The examples are presented as a general warning against an oversimplified methodological approach to digital divide studies.",The Information Society,2006,22,5,279-290,"Vehovar, Vasja; Sicherl, Pavle; Hüsing, Tobias; Dolnicar, Vesna",University of Ljubljana,Slovenia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002642735,140,"[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|151;[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Internet Research|1997|7|3|170-188|10.1108/10662249710171814|pub.1002872177|179;[Sicherl, Pavle]|[ur.014743726325.64]|Kyklos|1973|26|3|559-575|10.1111/j.1467-6435.1973.tb01881.x|pub.1007245014|21;[Petrič, Gregor]|[ur.01232436122.58]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|291-301|10.1080/01972240600904159|pub.1013058870|20;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|166;[Pruulmann-Vengerfeldt, Pille]|[ur.014105615271.31]|The Information Society|2006|22|5|303-310|10.1080/01972240600904233|pub.1031311915|9;[JUNG, JOO-YOUNG; QIU, JACK LINCHUAN; KIM, YONG-CHAN]|[; ur.013507560427.54; ]|Communication Research|2001|28|4|507-535|10.1177/009365001028004006|pub.1036789520|177;[DiMaggio, Paul; Hargittai, Eszter; Neuman, W.

Many reports and studies have provided statistical data (Digital Divide Network, 2002; NTIA, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000) pertaining to sociological aspects of ‘the divide,’ while some studies have examined policy issues involving universal service (Camp and Tsong, 2001) and universal access (Brewer and Chuter, 2002). Other studies have suggested ways in which the digital divide could be better understood if it were ‘reconceptualized’ in terms of an alternative metaphor, e.g. a ‘divide’ having to do with literacy (Warschauer, 2002), power (Moss, 2002), content (Carvin, 2000), or the (information) environment (Floridi, 2001). However, with the exception of Johnson (2001) and Koehler (2002), authors have tended not to question ‐ at least not directly ‐ whether the digital divide is, at bottom, an ethical issue. Many authors seem to assume that because disparities involving access to computing technology exist, issues underlying the digital divide are necessarily moral in nature. Many further assume that because this particular ‘divide’ has to do with something that is digital or technological in nature, it is best understood as a computer ethical issue. The present study, which examines both assumptions, considers four questions: (1) What exactly is the digital divide? (2) Is this ‘divide’ ultimately an ethical issue? (3) Assuming that the answer to (2) is ‘yes,’ is the digital divide necessarily an issue for computer ethics? (4) If the answer to (3) is ‘yes,’ what can/should computer professionals do bridge the digital divide?",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2003,1,2,99-108,"Tavani, Herman T",Rivier University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1015652973,7,"[]|[]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|2001|31|3|9-14|10.1145/504696.504698|pub.1003432695|10;[Monahan, Torin]|[ur.0732002560.48]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|2001|31|3|22-31|10.1145/504696.504700|pub.1010779846|6;[Grodzinsky, Frances S.; Tavani, Herman T.]|[ur.012403605437.72; ur.014153265602.68]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|2002|32|1|22-32|10.1145/511134.511138|pub.1030435925|6;[Camp, L.

pub.1095578263,10.1109/icmse.2006.313845,Analysis on the Model of Digital Divide & the Demonstration Research in Narrowing the Digital Divide with ICT,"Digital divide appears when China coordinates the development of traditional industry and informatization. The main reason is the asymmetric information caused by regional informatization difference. The study uses Keith Griffin's model that is about the generation and diffusion of agricultural green technology revolution, and uses the ideas of information economics to draw an Information and Communications Technology (ICT) diffusion model containing an isoquant. The ICT model can analyze user's different choices in communication technologies in different stages of informatization, and we can identify an ICT gap by crossing the isoquant of different stages and the ratio between different user's capital and laboring. The ICT gap can describe the size of the digital divide. A demonstration analysis is made on the informatization level of Liaoning province by informatization index measuring. The results show that ICT is an efficient way to narrow digital divide and also give suggestions in how to further develop ICT and narrow digital divide.",2006 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering,2006,,,62-67,"Jing, Han; Xi, Chen; Gui-Qing, Qi",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095578263,0,"[Griffin, Keith]|[ur.07600713203.60]||1979||||10.1007/978-1-349-16176-8|pub.1001036818|89;[Mosco, Vincent]|[]|The Information Society|1998|14|1|57-62|10.1080/019722498129015|pub.1019929867|22;[Cecchini, Simone; Scott, Christopher]|[ur.010657704011.01; ]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|2|73-84|10.1002/itdj.1590100203|pub.1022170550|213"
pub.1013051711,10.1002/meet.1450390110,Comparing internet and mobile phone digital divides,"The digital divide – differences in access to and usage of new communication technologies across sociodemographic groups – is a major policy and social issue. While results are fairly consistent on some topics (usage gaps are associated with education, income, and age), there are contradictions in other areas, and differences based on race and gender are largely disappearing. Recent research on the digital divide is almost entirely devoted to the Internet, with little analysis of the mobile phone. The paper summarizes recent research on the extent and distinctions of the Internet (and some mobile phone) digital divide. Analyses of a national representative telephone survey in 2000 considers similarities and differences in three kinds of digital divides for both the Internet and the mobile phone — users and nonusers, users and dropouts, and recent and veteran users. The results show that these three kinds of digital divides are conceptually and empirically different both within and across the Internet and mobile phone media.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2005,39,1,92-98,"Rice, Ronald E.; Katz, James E.","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013051711,4,"[Haddon, Leslie]|[ur.014203031645.98]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/1461444800002004001|pub.1024226259|86;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Kalsbeek, William D.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.015433304767.25; ur.0622372055.57; ur.015170142645.13]|Communications of the ACM|1996|39|12|36-46|10.1145/240483.240490|pub.1030038578|146;[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Communications of the ACM|1997|40|4|97-102|10.1145/248448.248464|pub.1039508061|63;[MILLER, JON D.]|[]|Science Communication|2001|22|3|256-273|10.1177/1075547001022003003|pub.1048922554|19;[Katz, James E.]|[]|Info|2003|5|4|46-46|10.1108/14636690310495274|pub.1061015340|136;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|278;[Howard, P.E.N.; Rainie, L.; Jones, S.]|[; ur.013223520340.72; ur.015414041740.33]|American Behavioral Scientist|2001|45|3|383-404|10.1177/00027640121957259|pub.1063544514|269;[Katz, J.E.; Rice, R.E.; Aspden, P.]|[ur.016135056233.08; ur.014077537323.51; ur.010227365433.48]|American Behavioral Scientist|2001|45|3|405-419|10.1177/00027640121957268|pub.1063544515|193;[Haddon, L.G.]|[]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/14614440022225878|pub.1064003974|13;[]|[]|Choice|2000|37|05|37-2596-37-2596|10.5860/choice.37-2596|pub.1073362148|18;[E., Katz James]|[]|Machines that become Us, The Social Context of Personal Communication Technology|2017||||10.4324/9780203786826|pub.1091239328|38;[]|[]|Social Consequences of Internet Use|2002||||10.7551/mitpress/6292.001.0001|pub.1111385931|400;[]|[]|Accessing and Browsing Information and Communication|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/1066.001.0001|pub.1113137040|73"

pub.1033243853,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.05.003,Measuring Internet usage: The Israeli case,"The article describes two instruments for measuring Internet Usage and the changes in subjects’ Internet usage following a controlled intervention. It focuses on the use of usage and lack of usage for measuring the digital gap. The “digital gap” is defined as the gap between individuals with and without access to technology (telephones, computers, Internet access) and related services. Since its emergence, the Internet has become the most important form of information and communication technology (ICT).The goal of the present research was to develop ways of measuring Internet usage for different segments of the Israeli population (it can also be used to measure Internet usage outside Israel). For the past few years, the Israeli government has sponsored programs designed to increase Internet usage in specific segments of the Israeli population. Some of these programs have been “controlled programs”. Controlled Internet Usage Programs are planned and monitored programs, which use research methods to discover whether they have increased Internet usage and changed Internet habits.The population of Internet users in Israel is presently 45.8% (compared with 68.2% in the US population). The past 5 years has witnessed a significant rise in the number of Internet users in the West in general and in Israel specifically: an increase of 152% in the number of Israeli households connected to the Internet during the period 2000–2005.However, large differences are apparent between the stronger and weaker sections of the Israeli population where the Internet is concerned, and controlled intervention is therefore a very important means of reducing these discrepancies.The present article describes two measurement instruments: the first instrument examines on-line proficiency, while the second determines patterns of Internet use and the status of respondents’ “Internet awareness”.The instruments were built to determine the reduction in the digital divide associated with Internet usage following controlled intervention, and the population's Internet usage status before and after intervention. The difference between the two measurements represents the increase or decrease in Internet usage.These two instruments may be used by agencies making decisions about resource disbursement to reduce the digital divide in a variety of populations.",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,2006,64,10,984-997,"Fisher, Yael; Bendas-Jacob, Orit",Achva Academic College,Israel,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033243853,5,"[Cattell, Raymond B.]|[]|Multivariate Behavioral Research|1966|1|2|245-276|10.1207/s15327906mbr0102_10|pub.1025511185|8768;[Ricci, Andrea]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2000|17|1-2|141-167|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00002-2|pub.1031906557|40;[Peled, Alon; Rashty, David]|[ur.01154664545.47; ]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1999|21|4|413-431|10.2190/nlr6-k355-laqy-u01d|pub.1039161410|33;[Te'eni, Dov; Young, Dennis R.]|[ur.012420314006.93; ]|Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|2003|32|3|397-414|10.1177/0899764003254900|pub.1041205486|31;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.; Schlosser, Ann]|[; ; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|3|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00341.x|pub.1061923611|137;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|999;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1165-40-1165|10.5860/choice.40-1165|pub.1073382743|912"

First, I criticize policymakers who rely on simplistic measures of the digital divide, at the expense of a thoughtful analysis of (1) the purpose of the tool, (2) the level of observation, and (3) the method of approaching the data. Second, I argue that networks and associated technologies are not neutral artifacts but are political and social spaces in their structure as well as in their content levels. Accordingly, we need to factor in the context as an important actor in conceptualizing and measuring the digital divide. Third, two general types of indices are used for the measurement of the digital divide(s): focused monotopical indices and comprehensive indices. Monotopical indices are more widely available, while comprehensive ones are rare. I argue that policymakers need to promote comprehensive indices over monotopical indices.

In the U.S., we witnessed a massive infusion of computers and Internet access in homes, schools, libraries, and other neighborhood institutions. This has significantly increased citizens’ physical access to information and communication technology (ICT) artifacts and has enhanced citizens’ opportunities for acquiring and strengthening technical skills. However, does increased physical access and technical skills signal closure of the digital divide? In this chapter, I address this question by describing the preconstructed ways in which the digital divide is conceptualized by academics and policymakers, and inferring what these conceptualizations suggest about the existential significance of the digital divide as experienced by historically underserved groups in the U.S.",Information Technology Ethics,2007,,,200-212,"Hongladarom, Soraj; Ess, Charles; Kvasny, L.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016867393,3,

The term is also used to characterize the disparity between those who can effectively use information technology and those who cannot. This paper explores the digital divide within the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. Factors contributing to the widening of the gap are identified, including differences in income, age, education, race, household type, and geographic location. In an effort to reduce the Digital Divide, initiatives have been undertaken, such as promoting increased competition to reduce equipment and internet connection costs and U.S. government legislation to provide incentives such as tax relief to Internet providers serving specific geographic areas, and the global initiative by the G- 8 Heads of State to help coordinate worldwide government efforts in closing the Digital Divide.",InSITE Conference,2001,,,,"C.

The authors (a) “map” the global digital divide with multiple indicators to find patterns of varying degrees of differentiation between countries worldwide and between blocs of countries and (b) assess the various national characteristics that contribute to the level of IT connectedness. The authors compare the effects of these various social national conditions on the pervasiveness of IT. Their preliminary results indicate that it is neither political nor economic national characteristics that are the determinants of IT connectedness but that cultural features are the prime causes.

Those people who do not have access to information technology are at a significant economic and social disadvantage. As with any other policy decision, in order to evaluate policies for dealing with the digital divide, we need to know exactly what our goal should be. Since the principal value of access to information technology is that it leads to knowledge, work in epistemology can help us to clarify our goal in the context of the digital divide. In this paper, I argue that epistemic value theory can help us to determine which distribution of knowledge to aim for. Epistemic value theory cannot specify a particular distribution to aim for, but it can significantly narrow down the range of possibilities. Additionally, I indicate how the exercise of applying epistemic value theory to the case of the digital divide furthers work in epistemology.",Information Technology and Social Justice,2007,,,29-46,"Rooksby, Emma; Weckert, John; Fallis, Don",University of Arizona,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040535260,5,

The usual conception of the digital divide as a bifurcation between the information ‘rich’ and ‘poor’ in fact does a poor job at describing the reality of the situation, which is characterized by multiple dimensions of digital divides in many contexts. Taking the lead from Albert Borgmann, it is recognized that the so-called information poor do possess a rich resource of information which needs to be fully accounted for in order to solve the global digital divide problem. In addition, making information transparent means, following the theory of development of Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, that information should be made available and accessible through a system of representation.

pub.1039002537,10.1080/1097198x.2005.10856401,A Conceptual Framework for the Role of Government in Bridging the Digital Divide,"In the current era of technological growth and innovation, the role of information and communication technology (ICT) as a catalyst to enhance economic development and the quality of life in developing countries, has become an increasingly important issue. The term digital divide has been used to refer to the gap between those who have access to and utilize ICT versus those who do not. Based on the literature on the digital divide and calls for broad-spectrum interdisciplinary frameworks to guide research on this topic (Lu, 2001), a conceptual framework is presented in this paper to explain the forces that often increase the digital divide as well as those that can provide the means to bridge it. Using this framework, India is used as an illustrative case to document attempts to utilize ICT to enhance the economic circumstances and quality of life for the rural and poor segments of the Indian population and to argue that government and other public institutions have an important role in bridging the digital divide in developing countries. Further, the direct role of government is distinguished from the indirect role in order to clarify and delineate the various ways in which public institutions can facilitate bridging the digital divide.",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2005,8,3,28-46,"Mistry, Jamshed J.",Worcester Polytechnic Institute,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039002537,18,"[Lu, Ming-te]|[ur.015276504143.90]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2001|4|3|1-4|10.1080/1097198x.2001.10856304|pub.1012019015|45;[Bateman, Milford]|[ur.015427664346.16]|Small Business Economics|2000|14|4|275-298|10.1023/a:1008170805013|pub.1016644878|54;[Marangos, John]|[ur.013540176363.76]|Journal of International Development|2002|14|5|573-589|10.1002/jid.909|pub.1019207111|21;[Kaushik, Surendra K.]|[ur.07474065125.54]|American Journal of Economics and Sociology|2010|56|1|69-84|10.1111/j.1536-7150.1997.tb03452.x|pub.1019651167|17;[James, J.]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Futures|2003|35|5|461-472|10.1016/s0016-3287(02)00092-7|pub.1031846519|26;[Davison, Robert; Harris, Roger; Vogel, Doug; de Vreede, Gert Jan]|[ur.015315076147.37; ; ur.016344630467.67; ur.011536255313.17]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|1999|2|3|1-4|10.1080/1097198x.1999.10856255|pub.1036718468|5;[Palvia, Prashant C; Palvia, Shailendra C Jain; Whitworth, James Edward]|[ur.010366556753.27; ur.013376747015.60; ur.016516144503.82]|Information & Management|2002|39|5|403-414|10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00106-9|pub.1048006407|54;[Sharma, Sushil K.; Gupta, Jatinder N.D.]|[ur.013744356242.19; ur.014570173447.25]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2003|6|3|3-21|10.1080/1097198x.2003.10856353|pub.1049911686|20;[Matsuyama, Kiminori]|[]|Journal of Political Economy|2002|110|5|1035-1070|10.1086/341873|pub.1058639175|150;[Mansell, R.]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|282-295|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.282|pub.1059967054|77;[RIGGINS, FREDERICK J.]|[ur.013255447741.01]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2004|21|2|161-179|10.1080/07421222.2004.11045807|pub.1085538068|18;[Compaine, Benjamin M.]|[]|The Digital Divide|2001||||10.7551/mitpress/2419.001.0001|pub.1110922707|242"

I propose a framework, which provides a wider, and more nuanced, lens to look through. It focuses work in ways and in areas consistently overlooked by the digital divide, particularly on the realities, voices, and complexities within its unconnected, “have not” spaces — the zones of silence. Encouraging critical questioning of assumptions and an understanding of local contexts and points of view, a zones of silence framework is a way to broaden the dialogue on global communication and information access beyond a discourse of need, to one of mutual questioning, sharing, and learning.

pub.1072709311,10.5210/fm.v11i3.1318,Digital divide or digital development?: The Internet in Mexico,"This paper discusses the development of the Internet in Mexico within the context of the digital divide. There is skepticism about whether the digital divide is something driven primarily by technology rather than an epiphenomenon driven by socioeconomic factors. The barriers to access are not technological but rather economic and historical. Although Mexico shows wide disparities in Internet access, it also shows rapid development toward more access. The number of regular Internet users in Mexico is small (about 14 million) but has shown consistent growth. Business and non–governmental organization presence on the Web is increasing, and the Mexican government is innovatively using the Web to broaden contact with its citizens. In the Mexican case, there is certainly evidence of a digital divide. Nevertheless, there is also ample evidence of digital development.",First Monday,2006,,,,"Curry, James; Kenney, Martin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709311,13,
pub.1063872579,10.1177/0894439305278975,Follow the Money,"Expanding the principles of the universal provision of telecommunications services to encompass elementary and secondary schools and libraries, lawmakers paved the way for the creation of the E-Rate program by passing the Telecommunications Act in 1996. The E-Rate program aims to bridge the digital divide in advanced telecommunications by offering services to eligible schools and libraries for educational purposes at discounted rates. Currently in its sixth cycle, the E-Rate program has provided nearly US$13 billion in discounts to eligible organizations. The program has inspired much controversy and criticism, yet studies provide evidence that the program is effectively helping to enhance the provision of services to traditionally disadvantaged communities. This study challenges these claims and presents empirical evidence that suggests E-Rate resources are not systematically allocated to underprivileged, rural states where funds would most effectively help to bridge the digital gap in access to telecommunications technologies.",Social Science Computer Review,2005,23,4,502-506,"Panagopoulos, Costas",Yale University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063872579,6,
pub.1016715647,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_16,Responsible Management of Digital Divides: An Oxymoronic Endeavor?,"This paper critiques the notion of responsible management of information systems by pointing out the intrinsic contradiction inherent in the idea of managing morality and ethics in information systems. The paper, being part of the tradition of critical research in IS, uses the example of managing digital divides to argue that a traditional view of management (here called heroic management) leads to conceptual problems. It will develop two basic arguments that undermine the possibility of responsible heroic management of digital divides: (1) Normative issues related to digital divides cannot be managed because management is part of the construction of the problem and therefore lacks the detached and objective viewpoint required for rational management. (2) The very concept of responsibility, if taken seriously and applied responsibly (here called reflective responsibility) requires a participative approach that contradicts the traditional top-down approach of heroic management. The paper will conclude with a discussion of what form management of IS needs to take if it wants to be responsible.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,231-243,"Stahl, Bernd Carsten",De Montfort University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016715647,0,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2005|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Stahl, Bernd Carsten]|[ur.015337552312.43]|European Journal of Information Systems|2005|14|5|487-491|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000560|pub.1000713386|10;[Wilson, F.A.]|[ur.011547164741.51]|Information Technology and People|1997|10|3|187-204|10.1108/09593849710178207|pub.1000996170|31;[Couldry, Nick]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|89-97|10.1023/a:1024916618904|pub.1007671680|28;[McGrath, Kathy]|[ur.016463703606.03]|Information Systems Journal|2005|15|2|85-101|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2005.00187.x|pub.1008991102|66;[Joia, Luiz Antonio; Bourlakis, Constatine A.; Bourlakis, Michael A.]|[; ; ur.016623674573.47]|IT-Based Management|2003|||257-276|10.4018/978-1-59140-033-2.ch015|pub.1013431726|3;[Goldman, Alvin I.]|[]|Responsibility|1999|||201-217|10.1017/cbo9780511524103.008|pub.1021392731|1;[Knights, David; Morgan, Glenn]|[ur.016101355257.07; ur.013120663717.72]|Organization Studies|1991|12|2|251-273|10.1177/017084069101200205|pub.1027242638|675;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2000|41||277-293|10.1007/978-0-387-35505-4_17|pub.1029343048|21;[Introna, Lucas D.]|[ur.014523651252.94]|Information Systems Series|1997||||10.1007/978-1-349-14549-2|pub.1032711998|150;[Moss, Jeremy]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|2|159-165|10.1023/a:1019983909305|pub.1037967441|28;[Parayil, Govindan]|[ur.015445147512.04]|The Information Society|2005|21|1|41-51|10.1080/01972240590895900|pub.1044826487|74;[Hacker, Kenneth L.; Mason, Shana M.]|[; ]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|99-115|10.1023/a:1024968602974|pub.1046772669|28;[McSorley, Kevin]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2003|5|2|75-87|10.1023/a:1024946302065|pub.1047728390|5;[Varey, Richard J.; Wood-Harper, Trevor; Wood, Bob]|[ur.010131636717.88; ur.012355330361.72; ur.014640563477.91]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|4|229-239|10.1080/0268396022000017725|pub.1058311989|25;[Mcaulay, Laurie; Doherty, Neil; Keval, Natasha]|[ur.010705772471.95; ur.0756366500.80; ]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|4|241-255|10.1080/0268396022000017734|pub.1058311990|25;[Fischer, John Martin]|[]|Ethics|1999|110|1|93-139|10.1086/233206|pub.1058552071|288;[Adam, A.]|[ur.014361323573.45]|IEEE Technology and Society Magazine|2001|20|3|39-46|10.1109/44.952764|pub.1061174714|11;[Fineman, Stephen]|[ur.016433252127.68]|Organization|2001|8|1|17-31|10.1177/135050840181002|pub.1063986663|55;[Newell, Sue; Swan, Jacky; Kautz, Karlheinz]|[ur.010643725351.91; ur.014427207751.43; ur.010777777537.75]|Organization|2001|8|1|97-120|10.1177/135050840181006|pub.1063986667|32;[Lawler, John]|[]|International Journal of Management Concepts and Philosophy|2004|1|1|61|10.1504/ijmcp.2004.004843|pub.1067471896|4;[Alvesson, Mats; Willmott, Hugh]|[ur.014743500027.52; ur.015537060261.58]|Academy of Management Review|1992|17|3|432|10.2307/258718|pub.1070010328|66;[Donaldson, Thomas; Preston, Lee E.]|[; ]|Academy of Management Review|1995|20|1|65|10.2307/258887|pub.1070010438|1376;[Gosling, Jonathan; Mintzberg, Henry]|[ur.01177524540.00; ur.01202705110.47]|Harvard Business Review|2003|81|11|54-63, 137||pub.1076597283|180;[Levy, David L.; Alvesson, Mats; Willmott, Hugh]|[; ur.014743500027.52; ur.015537060261.58]|Studying Management Critically|2003|||92-110|10.4135/9781446220030.n5|pub.1088010779|71;[Alvesson, Mats; Deetz, Stanley]|[ur.014743500027.52; ur.011177073471.13]||2000||||10.4135/9781849208918|pub.1095899280|951;[]|[]||2001||||10.4018/978-1-93070-806-8|pub.1096030018|261;[Stahl, Bernd Carsten]|[ur.015337552312.43]||2004||||10.4018/978-1-59140-172-8|pub.1096031184|22;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2039;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|304;[Hirschheim, Rudy; Klein, Heinz K.]|[ur.07550242121.68; ur.012120760240.46]|MIS Quarterly|1994|18|1|83|10.2307/249611|pub.1102515051|195;[Klein, Heinz K.; Myers, Michael D.]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|1999|23|1|67|10.2307/249410|pub.1102515063|2260;[Ngwenyama, Ojelanki K.; Lee, Allen S.]|[ur.014410037451.18; ur.015734003331.26]|MIS Quarterly|1997|21|2|145|10.2307/249417|pub.1102515102|391;[]|[]|Digital Capitalism|1999||||10.7551/mitpress/2415.001.0001|pub.1110617300|403"

Design/methodology/approach An overview of the literature on information literacy skills and the digital divide, an analysis of information seeking research, as well as experience in teaching a course in advanced information retrieval at the Department of Information Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa, inspired a theoretical model for addressing different layers of the digital divide.   Findings The digital divide concerns more than just ICT access and information skills. Individual commitment, group work, and intellectual and academic support from the institution might contribute to bringing people to higher levels of knowledge generation and communication.   Research limitations/implications At this stage it is a theoretical model that needs to be tested in practice.

In order to ensure the achievement of bridging digital divides, governments need to be aware of their absence and weakness in strategy formulation and implementation in addition to simply launching projects towards strategic visions and objectives. However, the literature shows little help for the governments to detect the shortcomings of their strategies and to identity gaps between strategic objectives and performance measures. The goal of this research is to propose generic strategic gaps models based on the balanced scorecard framework for identifying and analyzing the strategic gap situations. Both horizontal and vertical strategic gaps regarding project efforts for reducing digital divides will be determined and discussed. The proposed approach and analysis models are then applied to the case of Taiwan for demonstrating their feasibility and usefulness.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,226,,405-418,"Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I",National Chengchi University,Taiwan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008660144,1,"[Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I]|[ur.014676551131.71; ur.07504154434.16]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3591||151-162|10.1007/11545156_15|pub.1000354437|6;[Ahn, Heinz]|[]|Long Range Planning|2001|34|4|441-461|10.1016/s0024-6301(01)00057-7|pub.1020104242|207;[Chan, Yee‐Ching Lilian]|[ur.016012367043.41]|International Journal of Public Sector Management|2004|17|3|204-221|10.1108/09513550410530144|pub.1023565565|111;[Epstein, Marc; Manzoni, Jean-François]|[ur.010471520302.41; ur.01024023401.02]|European Management Journal|1998|16|2|190-203|10.1016/s0263-2373(97)00087-x|pub.1026722750|175;[Jalava, Jukka; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012713076467.26; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|189-210|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x|pub.1026761325|143;[Vining, Aidan; Meredith, Lindsay]|[ur.015470763741.23; ur.011647111107.49]|European Management Journal|2000|18|6|605-618|10.1016/s0263-2373(00)00053-0|pub.1027121890|5;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|185-191|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00036-4|pub.1027199920|96;[Griffiths, John]|[]|Australian Journal of Public Administration|2003|62|4|70-79|10.1111/j..2003.00350.x|pub.1030794848|37;[Yu, Chien-Chih; Wang, Hsing-I]|[ur.014676551131.71; ur.07504154434.16]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2004|3183||293-299|10.1007/978-3-540-30078-6_49|pub.1043729182|4;[Bates, Donald L.; Dillard, John E.]|[; ]|Journal of General Management|1992|18|1|51-62|10.1177/030630709201800104|pub.1084243758|3;[Harrison, E.

pub.1072709161,10.5210/fm.v0i0.1799,Digital divide or digital development?: The Internet in Mexico (originally published in March 2006),"This paper discusses the development of the Internet in Mexico within the context of the digital divide. There is skepticism about whether the digital divide is something driven primarily by technology rather than an epiphenomenon driven by socioeconomic factors. The barriers to access are not technological but rather economic and historical. Although Mexico shows wide disparities in Internet access, it also shows rapid development toward more access. The number of regular Internet users in Mexico is small (about 14 million) but has shown consistent growth. Business and non–governmental organization presence on the Web is increasing, and the Mexican government is innovatively using the Web to broaden contact with its citizens. In the Mexican case, there is certainly evidence of a digital divide. Nevertheless, there is also ample evidence of digital development.",First Monday,2007,,,,"Curry, James; Kenney, Martin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709161,0,

This paper challenges both assumptions. First, looking at various measures of the digital divide, there is a divide in per‐capita access to ICTs but developing countries show faster rates of growth in network development than developed countries. Moreover, when employing a per‐income measure of access, developing countries already “digitally leapfrog” the developed world. Second, the paper examines the prediction that disparities in absolute access to ICTs between countries will lead to reduced development prospects in poor countries. Past experience has shown that it is very difficult to make predictions of this type. The paper concludes that we may be posing the wrong policy questions when focusing on a “digital divide” as it is commonly understood.",Info,2003,5,6,15-24,"Fink, Carsten; Kenny, Charles J.",World Bank,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049974927,83,"[Venables, Anthony J.]|[ur.01314754670.49]|Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade|2001|1|2|135-159|10.1023/a:1012830529827|pub.1003943585|85;[Kenny, Charles]|[]|Oxford Development Studies|2003|31|1|99-113|10.1080/1360081032000047212|pub.1007736639|68;[Leamer, Edward E.; Storper, Michael]|[ur.016045311562.71; ur.011644520437.88]|Journal of International Business Studies|2001|32|4|641-665|10.1057/palgrave.jibs.84909988|pub.1010343490|461;[Kolko, Jed]|[ur.014355713036.84]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|211-232|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00067-1|pub.1041901600|48;[Forestier, Emmanuel; Grace, Jeremy; Kenny, Charles]|[; ur.07740001375.80; ur.010254167455.56]|Telecommunications Policy|2002|26|11|623-646|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00061-7|pub.1050411674|80;[Kenny, Charles]|[]|Info|2002|4|3||10.1108/info.2002.27204cab.001|pub.1061051123|3;[Freund, Caroline; Weinhold, Diana]|[ur.010623316205.08; ur.010167421435.52]|American Economic Review|2002|92|2|236-240|10.1257/000282802320189320|pub.1064523858|268;[Pritchett, Lant]|[ur.07401650667.86]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|1997|11|3|3-17|10.1257/jep.11.3.3|pub.1064529858|715;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|284;[Fink, Carsten; Mattoo, Aaditya; Rathindran, Randeep]|[ur.014324654347.78; ur.012674551767.03; ur.01314631625.26]|Policy Research Working Papers|2002||||10.1596/1813-9450-2909|pub.1109731826|49;[Fink, Carsten; Mattoo, Aaditya; Neagu, Ileana]|[ur.014324654347.78; ur.012674551767.03; ur.010664100473.36]|Policy Research Working Papers|2002||||10.1596/1813-9450-2929|pub.1109731846|25;[Freund, Caroline L.; Weinhold, Diana]|[ur.010623316205.08; ur.010167421435.52]|International Finance Discussion Paper|2000|2000|693|1-43|10.17016/ifdp.2000.693|pub.1120172029|19"
pub.1029188033,10.1108/14684520110410517,Addressing the digital divide,"The phrase “digital divide” has been applied to the gap that exists in most countries between those with ready access to the tools of information and communication technologies, and the knowledge that they provide access to, and those without such access or skills. This may be because of socio‐economic factors, geographical factors, educational, attitudinal and generational factors, or it may be through physical disabilities. A further gap between the developed and underdeveloped world in the uptake of technology is evident within the global community, and may be of even greater significance. The paper examines a number of these issues at the national level in the USA, UK, Canada and New Zealand, looking for evidence of the “digital divide”, assessing factors that contribute to it, and evaluating strategies that can help reduce it. The relevance of these strategies to developing countries, and strategies for reducing the international digital divide are also explored.",Online Information Review,2001,25,5,311-320,"Cullen, Rowena",Victoria University of Wellington,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029188033,166,

The global digital divide is a term often used to describe the gap between more and less economically developed nations, while at the national level, there is often an urban‐rural divide. In developing countries, most Internet users gain access through public access points like Internet cafés. In this article, we take a closer look at the digital divide within Tanzania. Based on a survey among Internet café users in rural, semi‐urban and central regions of the country, we find that the divide is mainly a question of finding venues with technology to access the Internet. The Internet users and usage at the different sites are surprisingly uniform, with, however, a few significant differences.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2007,31,1,1-15,"Furuholt, Bjørn; Kristiansen, Stein",University of Agder,Norway,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099624067,54,"[Wahid, Fathul; Furuholt, Bjørn; Kristiansen, Stein]|[ur.013457445222.48; ur.015566676416.20; ur.016237172131.67]|Information Development|2006|22|4|278-291|10.1177/0266666906073073|pub.1001258362|20;[Wong, Poh-Kam]|[ur.015333364767.86]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|167-187|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00065-8|pub.1002363516|88;[Kasusse, Michael]|[ur.013572454001.38]|The International Information & Library Review|2005|37|3|147-158|10.1016/j.iilr.2005.07.001|pub.1002854665|11;[Warschauer, Mark]|[ur.01314712222.01]|Scientific American|2003|289|2|42-47|10.1038/scientificamerican0803-42|pub.1003766461|144;[Mosse, Emílio Luís; Sahay, Sundeep]|[ur.014601477475.37; ur.012234426741.58]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||35-51|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_3|pub.1011804132|23;[van Dijk, Jan A.G.M.]|[ur.016570250333.33]|Poetics|2006|34|4-5|221-235|10.1016/j.poetic.2006.05.004|pub.1014130665|772;[Chachage, Bukaza Loth]|[]|Information Development|2001|17|4|226-233|10.1177/0266666014241033|pub.1017372800|10;[Rao, Siriginidi Subba]|[ur.07577615655.15]|Telematics and Informatics|2005|22|4|361-375|10.1016/j.tele.2005.01.007|pub.1027181732|82;[Korpela, Mikko; Montealegre, Ramiro; Poulymenakou, Angeliki]|[]|Organizational Information Systems in the Context of Globalization, IFIP TC8 & TC9 / WG8.2 & WG9.4 Working Conference on Information Systems Perspectives and Challenges in the Context of Globalization June 15–17, 2003, Athens, Greece|2003||||10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2|pub.1029658015|19;[Lucas, Henry; Sylla, Richard]|[; ]|Prometheus|2003|21|1|1-22|10.1080/0810902032000050983|pub.1035384846|21;[Mwesige, Peter G]|[ur.01235647071.13]|Telematics and Informatics|2004|21|1|83-101|10.1016/s0736-5853(03)00024-8|pub.1035927727|58;[Mathur, Akshay; Ambani, Dhirubhai]|[ur.013454375153.10; ur.015047336153.42]|The International Information & Library Review|2005|37|4|345-351|10.1016/j.iilr.2005.09.004|pub.1036600964|24;[Joseph, Richard]|[]|Prometheus|2001|19|4|333-336|10.1080/08109020110091396|pub.1037437947|35;[Hollifield, C.Ann; Donnermeyer, Joseph F]|[ur.015703100245.27; ur.01165325243.27]|Government Information Quarterly|2003|20|2|135-150|10.1016/s0740-624x(03)00035-2|pub.1040349281|73;[Kasusse, Michael]|[ur.013572454001.38]|The International Information & Library Review|2005|37|3|147-158|10.1080/10572317.2005.10762676|pub.1046334375|4;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|730;[Gyamfi, Alexander]|[]|Information Development|2005|21|1|22-30|10.1177/0266666905051910|pub.1053803399|26;[Kling, Rob]|[]|D-Lib Magazine|1999|5|1||10.1045/january99-kling|pub.1056730952|167;[Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.013325104101.71]|Journal of Information Science|2003|29|6|489-497|10.1177/0165551503296006|pub.1063750934|27;[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Journal of Information Science|2005|31|2|114-123|10.1177/0165551505050788|pub.1063750985|40;[Kristiansen, Stein; Furuholt, Bjørn; Wahid, Fathul]|[ur.016237172131.67; ur.015566676416.20; ur.013457445222.48]|The International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation|2003|4|4|251-263|10.5367/000000003129574315|pub.1072794199|61;[Haseloff, Anikar Michael]|[]|The Journal of Community Informatics|2005|1|3||10.15353/joci.v1i3.2032|pub.1133390354|50"
pub.1093299697,10.1109/hicss.2002.994085,G-8 Collaborative Initiatives and the Digital Divide: Readiness for e-Government,"At the G-8 Kyushu-Okinawa Summit in July 2000, the industrialized nations acknowledged the advancement of the private sector in information technology (IT) and committed the organization to the Global Digital Divide Initiative of the World Economic Forum Task Force. The Task Force outlined nine initiatives and a set of concrete action plans for implementation, which may achieve e-government readiness in developing countries. Major cultural variables, however, threaten to impede or thwart the facilitation of e-government even though many countries promote e-government policies. To examine the G-8's first effort to implement collaborative policy initiatives of the private, public, and non-profit sectors to eliminate the global digital divide, this paper will explore the relationship between six cultural variables and the implementation of the Digital Initiative to alleviate the digital divide and effect e-government readiness in developing countries.",Proceedings of the 35th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences,2002,,,10-19,"Brown, Cheryl L.",University of North Carolina at Charlotte,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093299697,7,"[Hwang, Sung-Don; Choi, Younghoon; Myeong, Seung-Hwan]|[; ur.012150746433.37; ur.012242206315.40]|Government Information Quarterly|1999|16|3|277-285|10.1016/s0740-624x(99)80028-8|pub.1028328868|26;[Milward, H.

pub.1002262470,10.1111/1467-8411.00103,The Digital Divide in East Asia,"The concept of a ‘digital divide’—inequality in access to modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) between industrialised and developing countries, and between urban and rural populations—has attracted much attention from policymakers, aid organisations, media and the general public. This paper places discussion of the digital divide in a broader economic context, linking it with the theory of economic growth and technological change. The network effects of diffusion of the Internet are related to the possibility of leap‐frogging by latecomers. This is seen as a ‘digital opportunity’ presented to developing countries by the ‘new economy’. This paper discusses the appropriate policy environment for bridging the digital divide, and concludes that the East Asian region has much to gain from the complementarities of its economies, their openness to trade in ICT products, and policy cooperation.",Asian-Pacific Economic Literature,2001,15,2,18-30,"Sidorenko, Alexandra; Findlay, Christopher",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002262470,13,"[Shy, Oz]|[ur.015773075021.43]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|1996|14|6|785-800|10.1016/0167-7187(96)01011-9|pub.1019854344|73;[Economides, Nicholas]|[ur.012112425417.80]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|1996|14|6|673-699|10.1016/0167-7187(96)01015-6|pub.1025098934|863;[Jorgenson, Dale Weldeau; Stiroh, Kevin J.]|[ur.012327275705.42; ur.012362462064.30]|Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|2000|2000|1|125-210|10.1353/eca.2000.0008|pub.1031925788|795;[Hobday, Mike]|[ur.012115134441.32]|Asian-Pacific Economic Literature|2001|15|1|13-29|10.1111/1467-8411.00092|pub.1032012003|62;[Phillips, Ronnie J.]|[]|Journal of Economic Issues|2000|34|2|267-289|10.1080/00213624.2000.11506266|pub.1043914387|14;[Ben-Porath, Yoram]|[ur.014041635641.81]|Journal of Political Economy|1967|75|4, Part 1|352-365|10.1086/259291|pub.1058572772|1284;[Card, David; Krueger, Alan B.]|[ur.01020200442.77; ur.0655705467.19]|Journal of Political Economy|1992|100|1|1-40|10.1086/261805|pub.1058575286|839;[Hanushek, Eric A; Kimko, Dennis D]|[ur.014257312001.03; ]|American Economic Review|2000|90|5|1184-1208|10.1257/aer.90.5.1184|pub.1064527140|988;[Jorgenson, Dale W]|[ur.012327275705.42]|American Economic Review|2001|91|1|1-32|10.1257/aer.91.1.1|pub.1064527160|754;[Baily, Martin Neil; Lawrence, Robert Z]|[ur.07471216453.51; ur.014132250442.35]|American Economic Review|2001|91|2|308-312|10.1257/aer.91.2.308|pub.1064527225|99;[Caselli, Francesco; Coleman, Wilbur John]|[ur.0707661350.95; ur.016237233756.43]|American Economic Review|2001|91|2|328-335|10.1257/aer.91.2.328|pub.1064527229|348;[Oliner, Stephen D; Sichel, Daniel E]|[ur.012303224745.40; ur.012566361004.04]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2000|14|4|3-22|10.1257/jep.14.4.3|pub.1064530097|807;[Gordon, Robert J]|[]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2000|14|4|49-74|10.1257/jep.14.4.49|pub.1064530098|636;[Liebowitz, S.

In 2000, LaGrange became the first city in the world to provide broadband Internet access to every citizen. This research explores the history of the initiative and documents the achievements made as well as the challenges that city officials have faced in bridging the digital divide. Due to the nature of the initiative, the case study provides a good context for examining the limits of technology access. In particular, we note that in spite of some positive results, the Free Internet Initiative has failed to have the impact that policy makers had hoped for with respect to bridging the digital divide. The implications of the city's experience with the initiative are discussed.","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003.

Using data collected by a variety of international organizations and in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, this research explores the creation, diffusion, and use of technology within the context of economic inequities, gender discrimination, and carbon dioxide pollution across nations. The article opens with a brief introduction to the technology revolution and the digital divide along with a theoretical discussion of the research objectives.

The global digital divide is defined as the difference in the value of IT index (comprised of four IT adoption data: the Internet, PC, Cell phone and telephone) of a nation from the U.S. A model is proposed that contains several new indicators, not tried in the literature before. The model is then tested on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) over a period of time. Results indicate that some of these indicators explain the existence of global digital divide.

pub.1017910211,10.1108/13287260710817683,Evaluating a digital divide index in a regional context,"Purpose The purpose of this research is to show that the provision of an increasing range of remote, electronic access channels by private and public sector bodies is predicated on a critical mass of citizenry utilising such access channels. However, a major concern is that the increasing use of ICT for private and public sector transactions is seen as potentially creating a “digital divide” between those with access to technology and those who do not. This paper adapts an index of the digital divide documented in previous work and utilises this instrument to analyse the depth and breadth of this phenomenon in a UK region – Wales.   Design/methodology/approach The paper discusses the construction of a “digital divide index” (DDIX) for Wales based upon the previous established work of Husing and Selhofer. The DDIX is applied to data collected as part of a major European‐wide project – UNDERSTAND.   Findings The DDIX situates four citizen segments in terms of internet access and usage – gender, age, education and income. There are no significant digital divides evident within the Welsh region in terms of gender and income. However, there are significant digital divides in terms of age and education.   Research limitations/implications The DDIX as formulated considers a limited range of possible dimensions, both in terms of citizen groups and internet access and usage. Other possible dimensions for consideration are discussed in the paper.   Practical implications Our application of a DDIX has been useful in highlighting the multi‐faceted nature of this phenomenon within a regional context. Further research is required both to refine such an important information society metric and to apply it in further domains of analysis.   Originality/value The paper will be of interest both to academic researchers and policy‐makers interested in understanding and measuring the digital divide.",Journal of Systems and Information Technology,2007,9,1,46-59,"Beynon‐Davies, Paul; Hill, Rebecca",Cardiff University; Swansea University,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017910211,11,"[Kottak, Conrad Phillip]|[ur.01051625102.26]|Social Science Computer Review|1996|14|1|10-15|10.1177/089443939601400103|pub.1012222403|6;[Beck, Eevi; Madon, Shirin; Sahay, Sundeep]|[; ur.011405200023.39; ur.012234426741.58]|The Information Society|2004|20|4|279-290|10.1080/01972240490481009|pub.1014337209|21;[SELWYN, NEIL; GORARD, STEPHEN; FURLONG, JOHN; MADDEN, LOUISE]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58; ur.015432003705.59]|Ageing and Society|2003|23|5|561-582|10.1017/s0144686x03001302|pub.1054868004|406;[Liff, Sonia; Shepherd, Adrian; Wajcman, Judy; Rice, Ronald; Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.015432352362.07; ; ur.015341463255.56; ; ur.014036273417.00]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2004||||10.2139/ssrn.1308492|pub.1102258232|56;[Olphert, C.

pub.1002033085,10.1007/11823100_13,Is It Only About Internet Access? An Empirical Test of a Multi-dimensional Digital Divide,"Scholars from different disciplines have recently studied a phenomenon called “the digital divide”. Since many of the new government information technology initiatives are based on Internet technologies and require the use of the Internet by citizens, understanding the digital divide (and consequently, the potential demand) is important for e-government scholars. For some researchers, the divide is not a problem and Internet access is the only relevant determinant of Internet use (access divide). For other researchers, the divide is rooted in more fundamental social differences and opportunities (multi-dimensional divide). Using data from the Piedmont region in Italy, this paper tests these two competing views of the digital divide. Overall, the models based on a multi-dimensional view have greater explanatory power and provide evidence about the relevance of multiple factors affecting both Internet access and Internet use. For instance, females use the Internet for a smaller number of activities than males. Individuals with more formal education and who can speak English use the Internet more. Finally, individuals with more experience using a PC and the Internet itself also use the Internet to perform a broader range of activities.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4084,,139-149,"Gil-Garcia, J.

Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models.

pub.1093712521,10.1109/hicss.2004.1265322,Factors Influencing the Adoption of Residential Broadband Connections to the Internet,"Broadband adoption has been slower than anticipated in the United States resulting in a number of proposed policy interventions ranging from nonintervention to extreme measures. Digital divide advocates are concerned that demographics of broadband users will reveal the same digital divide gaps that are observed in computer ownership and home Internet access. This study analyzes the factors influencing the adoption of residential broadband services using the Current Population Survey data from September 2001. Three statistical models on computer ownership, home Internet access, and broadband access are analyzed to illustrate the differences in demographics between the dependent variables. Using a logit regression model, the results show that the digital divide is the widest for computer ownership and the narrowest for broadband access. The implications of this study are that public policy interventions to bridge the digital divide should focus more on computer ownership, and less on broadband specific policies.","37th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2004.

We are developing a community-centred approach to learn how interaction techniques can compensate for poor communication across the digital divide. We have incorporated the lessons learned regarding social intelligence design in an abstraction and in a device called the SoftBridge. The SoftBridge allows communication to flow from endpoints through adapters, getting converted if necessary, and out to destination endpoints. Field trials are underway with two communities in South Africa: disadvantaged Deaf users and an isolated rural community. Initial lessons learned show that we have to design user interfaces that allow users to understand and cope with delay.

The paper suggests that sustainable regeneration requires a much more holistic approach to urban development than has been the case in previous strategies and policies and can benefit from using digital technologies. In order to turn the digital divide into a “digital dividend,” more emphasis needs to be placed on citizen engagement, empowerment and capacity building. This case study aims to provide examples of how a multi-agency partnership approach is working to tackle these challenges through the “ONE-Manchester” initiative (Open Network E-Manchester).",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,235,,19-29,"Carter, Dave",Manchester Digital Development Agency,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050175624,3,

Statistics show that there are significant disparities among the populations in the developed and developing world in terms of accessibility to, and use of, ICT. Research and development in digital libraries do not only require sophisticated ICT, they also call for huge investments in terms of money and intellectual resources. Developing countries are lagging behind in digital library research and development, due to the digital divide as well as the lack of appropriate resources required for research and development. As a result, users in the developing world are being deprived of digital library services. This paper argues that some recent global digital library developments can be used by users in the developing countries : subject gateways, digital reference services, free access to e-journals and e-books in many areas, e-print archives and free digital libraries. The paper ends with an action plan that may be used by library and information professionals in both developing and developed countries to exploit the benefits of these digital information resources and services.

The research, conducted through questionnaires, focuses on fifth‐grade students in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area because state‐mandated test results for core subjects are available at the state Department of Education web site. Thus, it allows the researchers to collect data on both technology accessibility and academic achievement. The findings show that the digital divide still exists, cutting through various socioeconomic factors, and that the relationship between technology accessibility and academic achievement may also exist, although it is very much complicated by other compounding factors, such as the subjects of learning, the uses of technology, and socioeconomic conditions. It is hoped that the findings of this research can help policy makers, school administrators and teachers better understand the issues of digital divide and the consequences of technology use in schools and beyond.

Adopting a qualitative approach, field interviews were conducted with tourism enterprises across rural, semi-rural, and metropolitan areas of Ecuador.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity of that claim in the case of the Isle of Man (IOM).   Design/methodology/approach A nominalist ontology and positivist epistemology characterizes the underpinning research philosophy for this case study. Research data consisted of secondary census instruments and primary data derived from interviews with a sample of IOM civil servants.   Findings The findings were that despite having better results in terms of the causes of digital divide, the IOM trailed the UK level of internet access to a significant degree. This result raises questions about the wisdom of basing digital divide and e‐government strategies on technology proliferation and economic indicators.   Research limitations/implications The IOM is a comparatively small entity compared to the UK. In addition, basing the primary data collected on IOM civil servants only may result in an element of bias.   Practical implications Many governments invest considerable sums of money on their digital divide and e‐government programmes which may be misdirected if they are addressing the wrong causes of it.

pub.1036982710,10.1016/s0308-5961(03)00068-5,"Comparing internet and mobile phone usage: digital divides of usage, adoption, and dropouts","Results from a national representative telephone survey of Americans in 2000 show that Internet and mobile phone usage was very similar, and that several digital divides exist with respect to both Internet and mobile phone usage. The study identifies and analyzes three kinds of digital divides for both the Internet and mobile phones—users/nonuser, veteran/recent, and continuing/dropout—and similarities and differences among those digital divides based on demographic variables. The gap between Internet users and nonusers is associated with income and age, but no longer with gender and race, once other variables are controlled. The gap between mobile phone users and nonusers is associated with income, work status, and marital status. The veteran/recent Internet gap is predicted by income, age, education, phone user, membership in community religious organizations, having children, and gender; for mobile phones, age, work status and marital status are predictors. The gap between continuing and dropout users is predicted by education for Internet usage and income for mobile phone usage. Finally, cross-categorization of Internet and mobile phone usage/nonusage is distinguished (significantly though weakly) primarily by income and education. Thus, there are several digital divides, each predicted by somewhat different variables; and while Internet and mobile phone usage levels in 2000 were about the same, their users overlap but do not constitute completely equivalent populations.",Telecommunications Policy,2003,27,8-9,597-623,"Rice, Ronald E; Katz, James E","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036982710,374,"[Palen, Leysia; Salzman, Marilyn]|[ur.010443020013.00; ur.012035761013.04]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work|2002|||135-153|10.1007/978-1-4471-0665-4_10|pub.1018513953|9;[Haddon, Leslie]|[ur.014203031645.98]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/1461444800002004001|pub.1024226259|86;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Kalsbeek, William D.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.015433304767.25; ur.0622372055.57; ur.015170142645.13]|Communications of the ACM|1996|39|12|36-46|10.1145/240483.240490|pub.1030038578|146;[Harper, Richard]|[]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work|2002|||207-226|10.1007/978-1-4471-0665-4_14|pub.1030583272|13;[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Communications of the ACM|1997|40|4|97-102|10.1145/248448.248464|pub.1039508061|63;[Ling, Rich]|[ur.011013050447.66]|The Mobile Connection|2004|||57-81|10.1016/b978-155860936-5/50004-0|pub.1042186636|11;[MILLER, JON D.]|[]|Science Communication|2001|22|3|256-273|10.1177/1075547001022003003|pub.1048922554|19;[Awh, R.

pub.1001267604,10.1002/itdj.20021,Contribution of information and communication technology to total factor productivity and externalities effects,"In this article, the authors attempt to find out what roles the digital divide plays in the dynamics of the growth gap among countries by looking at the relationship between ICT investment and the evolution of total factor productivity in 38 countries. The empirical results show that the digital divide, on one hand, widens the growth gap between countries. On the other hand, the global ICT diffusion generates ICT externalities, which have positive effects on the total factor productivity of less-developed countries. Therefore, the global digitalization may have both negative impacts, manifested in a widening digital divide and growth gap, and positive impacts reflected in the effects of knowledge spillovers. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2006,12,2,159-173,"Seo, Hwan-Joo; Lee, Young Soo",Sangji University; Korea Aerospace University,South Korea; South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001267604,24,"[Kiiski, Sampsa; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012603406201.20; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|297-310|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00071-3|pub.1001159834|316;[Baliamoune-Lutz, Mina]|[ur.07704711743.28]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|3|151-169|10.1002/itdj.1590100303|pub.1004608331|205;[Lucas, Robert E.]|[]|Journal of Monetary Economics|1988|22|1|3-42|10.1016/0304-3932(88)90168-7|pub.1006035902|10737;[Kraemer, Kenneth L.; Dedrick, Jason]|[ur.01003675072.26; ur.012525264627.36]|World Development|1994|22|12|1921-1931|10.1016/0305-750x(94)90183-x|pub.1008121327|100;[Arora, Ashish; Athreye, Suma]|[ur.014352322573.41; ur.011355325271.96]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|253-273|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00069-5|pub.1014040582|136;[Jalava, Jukka; Pohjola, Matti]|[ur.012713076467.26; ur.013107663011.00]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|189-210|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00066-x|pub.1026761325|143;[Coe, David T.; Helpman, Elhanan]|[ur.012476661623.30; ur.013455356743.30]|European Economic Review|1995|39|5|859-887|10.1016/0014-2921(94)00100-e|pub.1037176216|2470;[Barro, Robert J; Lee, Jong-Wha]|[ur.01313542524.54; ur.015213046613.87]|Journal of Monetary Economics|1993|32|3|363-394|10.1016/0304-3932(93)90023-9|pub.1051389315|988;[Romer, Paul M.]|[ur.016404664534.32]|Journal of Political Economy|1986|94|5|1002-1037|10.1086/261420|pub.1058574901|9458;[Ben-David, D]|[]|Oxford Economic Papers|2000|52|4|637-650|10.1093/oep/52.4.637|pub.1059948606|36;[Daveri, F.]|[]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2002|18|3|345-362|10.1093/oxrep/18.3.345|pub.1059967089|119;[Machin, Stephen; Van Reenen, John]|[ur.01250235220.68; ur.010404244713.16]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1215-1244|10.1162/003355398555883|pub.1063349116|594;[Caselli, Francesco; Coleman, Wilbur John]|[ur.0707661350.95; ur.016237233756.43]|American Economic Review|2001|91|2|328-335|10.1257/aer.91.2.328|pub.1064527229|348;[Oliner, Stephen D; Sichel, Daniel E]|[ur.012303224745.40; ur.012566361004.04]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2000|14|4|3-22|10.1257/jep.14.4.3|pub.1064530097|807;[Dewan, Sanjeev; Kraemer, Kenneth L.]|[ur.013554136011.86; ur.01003675072.26]|Management Science|2000|46|4|548-562|10.1287/mnsc.46.4.548.12057|pub.1064721996|470;[Young, Allyn A.]|[]|The Economic Journal|1928|38|152|527|10.2307/2224097|pub.1069838829|1376;[Kaldor, Nicholas]|[]|The Economic Journal|1957|67|268|591|10.2307/2227704|pub.1069841936|1156;[Kaldor, Nicholas]|[]|The Economic Journal|1975|85|340|891|10.2307/2230633|pub.1069844581|124;[Bernstein, Jeffrey I.; Nadiri, M.

E-services improve the responsiveness, efficiency and transparency of the public sector. Unfortunately, these benefits may not be realized by the entire population. A digital divide exists in society, both from an access point of view and from a skills point of view. This study explores the potential effects of the digital divide on e-government by surveying a diverse group of citizens to identify the demographic characteristics that impact use of e-government services. The results indicate that income, education, age and frequency of Internet use significantly impact the use of e-government services.

This “digital divide” has become a leading economic and civil rights issue. The digital divide is referred to as a social/political issue encompassing the socio-economic gap between communities that have access to computers, the Internet, and other information technology- related services and those that do not. The term also refers to gaps that exist between groups regarding their ability to use ICTs (information and communications technologies) effectively and the gap between those groups that have access to quality, useful digital content, and those that do not.",Encyclopedia of Information Ethics and Security,2007,,,130-135,"Quigley, Marian; Chen, Irene; Kidd, Terry T.",University of Houston - Downtown; The University of Texas Health Science Center,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000555538,1,

pub.1094359599,10.1109/itre.2003.1270667,Bridging the Digital Divide for Work and Play - A Workshop,"A multidisciplinary workshop, Bridging the Digital Divide for Work and Play, was held November 3–4, 2001, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The meeting attempted to identify the critical areas where research and development are needed to increase literacy in both developed and developing countries, while bridging the digital divide more generally. This paper, containing an account of the discussions at the workshop, addresses another objective of the workshop, i.e., the wide dissemination of its ideas. An important conclusion of the deliberations was that new inventions in hardware, systems, and software were not the key issues. Instead, designers need to rethink their specifications away from fastest, smallest, and leading edge as prime considerations. Trade-offs that emphasize worldwide access, affordability stability, and simplicity of use can make a significant contribution towards bridging the digital divide. Although not specifically addressed in our conclusions, it is important to recognize the motivations for learning to use new tools and technology. These are different by age group, with children and seniors wanting to “play,” while working adults learn best when it has a positive impact on their work.","International Conference on Information Technology: Research and Education, 2003.

pub.1002252553,10.1080/13600810500137889,"Policy Reform, Economic Growth and the Digital Divide","Rapid growth of internet use in high-income economies has raised the spectre of a “digital divide” that will marginalize developing countries because they can neither afford internet access nor use it effectively when it is available. Using a new cross-country data set, this paper investigates two proximate determinants of the digital divide: internet intensity (internet subscriptions per telephone mainline); and access to telecom services. Surprisingly, no gap in internet intensity was found. When differences in urbanization and competition policy are controlled for, low-income countries have intensities as high as those of industrial countries. While income does not seem to matter in this context, competition policy matters a great deal. Low-income countries with high World Bank ratings for competition policy have significantly higher internet intensities. The paper's finding on internet intensity implies that the digital divide is not really new, but reflects a persistent gap in the availability of mainline telephone services. After identifying mobile telephones as a promising new platform for internet access, the paper uses panel data to study the determinants of mobile telephone diffusion during the past decade. The results show that income explains part of the diffusion lag for the poor countries, but they also highlight the critical role of policy. Developing countries whose policies promote economic growth and private sector competition have experienced much more rapid diffusion of mobile phone service. Simulations based on the econometric results suggest that feasible reforms could sharply narrow the digital divide during the next decade for many countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.",Oxford Development Studies,2005,33,2,229-243,"Dasgupta, Susmita; Lall, Somik; Wheeler, David",World Bank,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002252553,77,"[Hardy, Andrew P.]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1980|4|4|278-286|10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0|pub.1003695597|273;[Lal, K.]|[ur.013634402562.72]|Information Economics and Policy|1996|8|3|269-280|10.1016/0167-6245(96)00011-x|pub.1012115706|30;[Easterly, William; Kremer, Michael; Pritchett, Lant; Summers, Lawrence H]|[ur.07715371231.81; ur.01016513415.93; ur.07401650667.86; ur.016575717155.78]|Journal of Monetary Economics|1993|32|3|459-483|10.1016/0304-3932(93)90026-c|pub.1051073441|426;[Bedi, Arjun S.]|[ur.010724605247.27]|SSRN Electronic Journal|1999||||10.2139/ssrn.3318589|pub.1111927255|17;[Torero, Maximo]|[ur.010717167130.38]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2000||||10.2139/ssrn.3336619|pub.1112744720|2"

This paper argues that a knowledge-based approach provides an effective means to understand and develop responses to various forms of disadvantage related to access and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). In developing this idea one area of social network analysis is used to make the claim that social networks are used by people to configure an ontology to negotiate the uncertainty of their day-to-day existence. It follows then that digital divide factors can be understood in terms of ICT facilitated knowledge development and related processes.

In December 2003, the United Nations held a World Summit on the Information Society to adopt a declaration that embodies, in its draft form at least, ""the ambitious vision"" of ""bridging the digital divide."" The declaration's hopes focus on the rapid pace of development of ICTs (information and communication technologies) unprecedented in history - which allows for the development of applications that make it possible that no one is left behind and that those who were left marginalised in previous development cycles can have a real opportunity to attain higher levels of development without having to follow the traditional path nor its time requirements.

Much of the Web remains inaccessible or difficult to access by people across a spectrum of disabilities and this may have serious implications for the potential use of the Web for increasing social inclusion. The topic of disabled Web access is introduced through a consideration of four discourses: digital divide, social construction of disability, legal, and Web accessibility. The lack of dialogue between these permits a passive liberal approach toward disability discrimination to prevail and this political position has become inscribed in widely used automatic software tools resulting in a reinforcement of the view that Web site accessibility approval may, in many cases, be deemed an empty shell.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,217-228,"Adam, Alison; Kreps, David",University of Salford,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049331009,8,"[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|New Media & Society|2004|6|3|341-362|10.1177/1461444804042519|pub.1003317453|656;[Adam, Alison]|[]||2005||||10.1057/9780230000520|pub.1013207499|42;[Goggin, Christopher Newell Gerard]|[]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|127-133|10.1080/01972240050032889|pub.1017914438|42;[*, Baorong Guo; Bricout, John C.; Huang, Jin]|[; ; ]|Disability & Society|2005|20|1|49-66|10.1080/0968759042000283638|pub.1023509754|80;[Ritchie, Heather; Blanck, Peter]|[ur.01242213444.66; ur.01024274601.32]|Behavioral Sciences & the Law|2003|21|1|5-26|10.1002/bsl.520|pub.1027558512|71;[Kurniawan, Sri; Zaphiris, Panayiotis; Kreps, David; Adam, Alison]|[; ; ur.014201175023.52; ur.014361323573.45]|Advances in Universal Web Design and Evaluation|2007|||25-42|10.4018/978-1-59904-096-7.ch002|pub.1030426611|2;[Trauth, Eileen M.; Quesenberry, Jeria L.; Morgan, Allison J.]|[ur.07421642022.90; ur.012310537371.58; ur.012221761437.38]|Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Computer personnel research Careers, culture, and ethics in a networked environment - SIGMIS CPR '04|2004|||114-119|10.1145/982372.982400|pub.1033309200|61;[Cooper, Joel; Weaver, Kimberlee D.]|[; ur.0770707336.29]||2003||||10.4324/9781410608932|pub.1034254512|180;[SELWYN, NEIL]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Social Policy|2002|31|1|1-20|10.1017/s0047279402006487|pub.1035487375|76;[Winner, Langdon]|[ur.01333216147.94]|ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society|1997|27|3|14-19|10.1145/270858.270864|pub.1040957157|64;[Hoque, Kim; Noon, Mike]|[ur.016025530735.35; ur.010762506503.62]|Work Employment and Society|2004|18|3|481-506|10.1177/0950017004045547|pub.1050925259|172;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2039;[Servon, Lisa J.]|[]|Bridging the Digital Divide|2002||||10.1002/9780470773529|pub.1109492537|183"

Design/methodology/approach The article critically examines the Networked Readiness Index in terms of its presentation and its underlying model. It relies on an approach to policy analysis that views policy problems as socially constructed.   Findings E‐readiness assessment tools purport to show how ready the nations of the world are to exploit the potential of new information and communication technologies. Yet they do more than that; being actively engaged in constructing policy problems. In the case of the NRI, the problem of the international digital divide is defined in a particular way that privileges certain interests while at the same time legitimatizing its inclusion on the agenda of international organizations as a problem worthy of sustained attention.   Practical implications The findings of the article suggest a need for alternative indicators that register the voices of a wider range of groups and could therefore create a more inclusive digital divide policy problem.

Correspondence courses using printed material and postal mail have been replaced by Web-based courses with the potential to make learning available to anyone, anywhere at anytime. This potential cannot be realized, however, unless two digital divides are eliminated. Some people are on the wrong side of the first “digital divide” between the technology “haves” and the technology “have-nots”. The benefits of technology are less available to those who are poor, who live in rural areas, who are members of minority racial or ethnic groups, and/or who have disabilities (Kaye, 2000; U.S. Department of Commerce, 1999). Lack of access to new technologies limits their options for taking and teaching technology-based courses. This is true for individuals with disabilities, even though the rapid development of assistive technology makes it possible for an individual with almost any type of disability to operate a computer (2003 Closing the Gap Resource Directory, 2003). Unfortunately, many people with disabilities still do not have access to these empowering tools, putting them on the “have not” side of the first digital divide.","Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, First Edition",2005,,,3079-3084,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Burgstahler, Sheryl",University of Washington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041292375,2,

Identifies some international initiatives to develop ICT infrastructure and proposes the development of telecenters, techmobiles and technology resource centers, and the use of the ‘old boy network' or ‘past students' associations’, to provide access to digital technology. Identifies the need to create Internet content in African languages, developing African language keyboards and conduct needs assessments of local users. Makes proposals for training teachers to teach information literacy skills, involving libraries in information literacy skills development and instituting mass information literacy programs.

There are myriad compelling reasons why information technology (IT) managers and companies that are dependent on IT should support efforts to decrease the digital divide. First and foremost, full participation in life in the information age requires computer literacy and Internet access. Computer-literate people are more likely to have an interest in IT-related careers, require less on-the-job training, contribute higher value to their employers, participate in e-government, and raise computer-literate children. The availability of applications such as electronic commerce, electronic payment, brokering services, and collaborative engineering to strengthen the relationships among manufacturers, suppliers, developers, and customers has grown rapidly. The potential convergence of wireless technology, television, and virtual reality is what the future has in store. As a result of the failure of so many e-commerce companies at the turn of the century, the momentum of the information age has stalled.

pub.1099624544,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2004.tb00114.x,Bridging the Digital Divide in Caribbean Group Decision‐Making,"Caribbean organizations, like their counterparts in developed countries, engage in countless group decision meetings that require structuring mechanisms to help produce effective outcomes. However, no such meeting support was available to the breakout sessions at the January 2003 meeting of The United Nations information and communication technologies (UNICT) task force to discuss the digital divide as it affects Caribbean community and common market (CARICOM) countries. Whereas group support systems (GSS) have been widely discussed in the literature, there is no evidence of their use in the English‐speaking Caribbean, a situation which may be classified as another instance of the digital divide. Against this backdrop, we examine the process of organizational decision‐making within groups, the factors influencing group behaviors and interaction and the advantages and disadvantages of structuring mechanisms such as the technology‐enabled GSS and the manual, nominal group technique (NGT). The paper concludes that it is desirable for Caribbean nations to acquire GSS technology to reap some of the benefits that other developing countries have experienced. However, despite its runner‐up status (to GSS), NGT provides similar assistance to that offered by GSS, is implementation‐friendly, inexpensive, and outperforms other manual techniques in creative decision‐making; it is therefore a viable alternative for Caribbean nations struggling to bridge the digital divide.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2004,17,1,1-23,"Duggan, Evan W.; Virtue, Grace",University of Alabama; Howard University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099624544,7,"[Duggan, Evan W.]|[ur.012443113223.52]|Human-Computer Interaction|2003|18|4|373-394|10.1207/s15327051hci1804_2|pub.1002429991|25;[Davidson, Robert; Qureshi, Sajda; de Vreede, Gert-Jan; Vogel, Doug; Jones, Noel]|[; ur.011420303741.26; ur.011536255313.17; ur.016344630467.67; ur.013160502672.59]|Journal of Global Information Technology Management|2000|3|4|6-23|10.1080/1097198x.2000.10856287|pub.1003278361|5;[Stephenson, Blair Y.; Michaelsen, Larry K.; Franklin, Stephen G.]|[ur.015025371017.79; ur.016020652351.05; ur.011506122551.13]|Group & Organization Management|1982|7|3|320-334|10.1177/105960118200700305|pub.1005123233|19;[Diehl, Michael; Stroebe, Wolfgang]|[ur.016641272725.83; ur.0742226061.13]|Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|1987|53|3|497-509|10.1037/0022-3514.53.3.497|pub.1013227758|1316;[Dennis, Alan R.; Hayes, Glenda S.; Daniels, Robert M.]|[; ; ]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1999|15|4|115-142|10.1080/07421222.1999.11518224|pub.1015374711|47;[Duggan, Evan W.; Thachenkary, Cherian S.]|[ur.012443113223.52; ur.016376666142.64]|Information Technology and Management|2003|4|4|391-408|10.1023/a:1025134318528|pub.1015836313|9;[Valacich, Joseph S.; Dennis, Alan R.; Connolly, Terry]|[ur.016415474467.72; ur.015000614017.19; ur.0617142567.25]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1994|57|3|448-467|10.1006/obhd.1994.1024|pub.1017642109|295;[Briggs, Robert O.; Adkins, Mark; Mittleman, Daniel; Kruse, John; Miller, Scot; Nunamaker, Jay F.]|[ur.013202236033.60; ur.07760052521.78; ur.016024050275.32; ur.016646424535.90; ur.012441513042.38; ur.010273622745.50]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1998|15|3|151-195|10.1080/07421222.1998.11518217|pub.1018660597|106;[Tan, Bcy; Watson, Rt; Wei, Kwok-Kee]|[ur.014050127277.40; ur.012611725373.97; ur.0576031715.72]|European Journal of Information Systems|1995|4|2|82-92|10.1057/ejis.1995.10|pub.1018937490|47;[Ocker, Rosalie; Fjermestad, Jerry; Hiltz, Starr Roxanne; Johnson, Kenneth]|[ur.011032567505.18; ur.016340232435.37; ur.01076405404.90; ur.07752333033.35]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1998|15|1|99-118|10.1080/07421222.1998.11518198|pub.1019100754|71;[Liou, Yihwa Irene; Chen, Minder]|[ur.016052211653.58; ur.012610220505.45]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1993|10|3|25-41|10.1080/07421222.1993.11518009|pub.1020940131|30;[Niederman, Fred]|[ur.07427570367.08]|Journal of Global Information Management|1997|5|1|17-26|10.4018/jgim.1997010102|pub.1021970712|7;[Caouette, Margaretta J.; O'Connor, Bridget N.]|[ur.015230451771.62; ur.016623412771.44]|Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce|1998|8|1|57-81|10.1207/s15327744joce0801_3|pub.1023053830|8;[Valacich, Joseph S.; Schwenk, Charles]|[ur.016415474467.72; ur.013603507741.04]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1995|63|2|158-173|10.1006/obhd.1995.1070|pub.1023623453|93;[Bartunek, Jean M.; Murninghan, J.

The spread of the Internet has been accompanied by hopes for a democratic revival. But there are also fears that a new divide is emerging — the Digital Divide. How well-founded are these hopes and fears?

Even though, according to some reports, the gap is getting narrower, this does not mean that the problem is disappearing, because the problem does not just consist in getting more people to become ‘wired’, so to speak. This paper investigates the various relationships among the global digital divide, global justice, cultures and epistemology. Very briefly stated, not getting access to the Internet constitutes an injustice because the access is a social good that can lead to various other goods. Furthermore, as information technology is a second-order technology, one that operates on meaning bearing symbols, access to the technology is very much an issue of social epistemology, an attempt to find out the optimal way to distribute knowledge across the social and cultural domains.",Information Technology and Social Justice,2007,,,93-111,"Rooksby, Emma; Weckert, John; Hongladarom, Soraj",Chulalongkorn University,Thailand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000550454,0,

Policy makers worldwide clearly declare that the main aim of their technology diffusion strategies is the elimination of the gap between ‘haves‘ and ‘have-nots’ in the cyberspace. In this paper we extent previous research on the application of the stakeholder analysis in electronic commerce policy making [1] by focusing on its normative aspect. According to this aspect it is ethically appropriate for policy makers to consider all stakeholders, which are relevant to their strategies. We argue that the need to consider the widest spectrum of stakeholders in the implementation of electronic commerce policies may lead to a fair strategy towards the elimination of the digital divide.","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003.

Findings After 1 May 2004, when the EU was enlarged from 15 to 25 member states, the digital divide in the EU widened substantially (national connectivity varying from less than 10 to more than 60 per cent), caused by regional lack of technological infrastructure as well as cultural and psychological factors.   Research limitations/implications Many “most recent” national data on internet‐connectivity are two years old.   Practical implications Inequality in internet‐connectivity in the EU will increase dramatically, with all consequences for communication, dissemination of information, economy (e‐commerce!), etc. Consequently, parallel to digital media, traditional means of dissemination of information – such as printed books, public libraries, local broadcasting – should be maintained and furthered.",New Library World,2005,106,3/4,164-172,"Hubregtse, Sjaak",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053626666,13,

Two main and interrelated strands of evidence are presented: First, contrary to expectations that rising income per capita will tend to reduce wealth and wage disparities, the distribution of income and wealth both between countries and individuals has sharply skewed in the information age; second, knowledge production is a self-reinforcing cycle that tends to disproportionately reward some and exclude others. The so-called digital divide is as much a symptom and a cause of these broader techno-economic phenomena, and regarding it as a simple issue of connectivity is simplistic and reductive.",The Information Society,2005,21,1,41-51,"Parayil, Govindan",University of Oslo,Norway,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044826487,74,"[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Review of International Political Economy|2001|8|1|147-162|10.1080/09692290010010281|pub.1002273570|14;[Ahluwalia, Montek S.]|[ur.014133412511.72]|Journal of Development Economics|1976|3|4|307-342|10.1016/0304-3878(76)90027-4|pub.1005846482|385;[Wolff, Edward N.]|[ur.014040432267.06]|Information Economics and Policy|2002|14|2|233-251|10.1016/s0167-6245(01)00068-3|pub.1007566875|7;[Drahos, Peter]|[]|The Information Society|1995|11|3|209-222|10.1080/01972243.1995.9960193|pub.1019284091|17;[de la Mothe, John]|[ur.011347363310.13]|Technology in Society|2004|26|2-3|523-536|10.1016/j.techsoc.2004.01.009|pub.1027532638|20;[Antonelli, Cristiano]|[ur.016105373552.67]|Information Economics and Policy|2003|15|2|173-199|10.1016/s0167-6245(02)00093-8|pub.1030504131|63;[Lucas, Henry; Sylla, Richard]|[; ]|Prometheus|2003|21|1|1-22|10.1080/0810902032000050983|pub.1035384846|21;[Maddison, Angus]|[]|Development Centre Studies|2003||||10.1787/9789264104143-en|pub.1036559034|919;[Sutcliffe, B.]|[]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2004|20|1|15-37|10.1093/oxrep/grh002|pub.1059967359|76;[Piketty, T.; Saez, E.]|[ur.010004477566.68; ur.016146700245.30]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|2003|118|1|1-41|10.1162/00335530360535135|pub.1063348942|2055;[Autor, David H.; Katz, Lawrence F.; Krueger, Alan B.]|[ur.011241342041.35; ur.01165352155.05; ur.0655705467.19]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1169-1213|10.1162/003355398555874|pub.1063349115|1198;[Berman, Eli; Bound, John; Machin, Stephen]|[; ur.01131520521.49; ur.01250235220.68]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1998|113|4|1245-1279|10.1162/003355398555892|pub.1063349117|713;[Stiroh, Kevin J]|[ur.012362462064.30]|American Economic Review|2002|92|5|1559-1576|10.1257/000282802762024638|pub.1064524008|431;[Caselli, Francesco]|[]|American Economic Review|1999|89|1|78-102|10.1257/aer.89.1.78|pub.1064526794|328;[Wood, Adrian]|[]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|1995|9|3|57-80|10.1257/jep.9.3.57|pub.1064531316|472;[Berman, E.; Bound, J.; Griliches, Z.]|[; ur.015252354520.70; ur.01147673254.12]|The Quarterly Journal of Economics|1994|109|2|367-397|10.2307/2118467|pub.1069768965|1087;[Krueger, A.

The different deployment rhythms of broadband networks threaten to increase the distance separating developed and developing countries. However, inside developed countries, separating lines are also being traced on regional or local scales. The magnitude and characteristics of this second form of geographic digital divide are not thoroughly known. This article provides this analysis for a specific case, namely the Community of Madrid. We conclude that outside the metropolitan areas, adapting existing infrastructures, instead of deploying new networks, is the actual base for expanding broadband accessibility. However, it seems certain that the deployment is quite far from being universal, at least in the medium term. Population size seems to be the most relevant criterion for identifying “threatened” areas.",Universal Access in the Information Society,2004,3,3-4,264-271,"Gómez Barroso, José Luis; Pérez Martínez, Jorge",National University of Distance Education; Technical University of Madrid,Spain; Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011613866,7,

Based on previous validated studies, the researchers offered a new theoretical model in examining the influences of the two mediating factors – Internet self-efficacy and outcome expectations – on the elderly's intentions in adopting a new technology (i.e. the Internet), and their perceptions of their knowledge in utilizing this technology. The elderly are categorized as one of the technologically and sociologically disadvantaged groups within the context of the digital divide.

The author finds that there is tremendous variation as to how often state legislators use the Internet to gather policy information. The author did not find evidence of a digital divide as it pertains to urbanism, or gender. It appears that a digital divide remains, however, between young and old legislators—with younger legislators using the Internet more often— and legislators in California versus legislators in Georgia and Iowa. In the end, it appears that the digital divide in the state legislature is shrinking.

pub.1037634725,10.4018/978-1-59140-799-7.ch058,E-Government and the Digital Divide,"Many governments world wide are attempting to increase accountability, transparency, and the quality of services by adopting information and communications technologies (ICTs) to modernize and change the way their administrations work. Meanwhile e-government is becoming a significant decision-making and service tool at local, regional and national government levels. The vast majority of users of these government online services see significant benefits from being able to access services online. The rapid pace of technological development has created increasingly more powerful ICTs that are capable of radically transforming public institutions and private organizations alike. These technologies have proven to be extraordinarily useful instruments in enabling governments to enhance the quality, speed of delivery and reliability of services to citizens and to business (VanderMeer & VanWinden, 2003). However, just because the technology is available does not mean it is accessible to all. The term digital divide has been used since the 1990s to describe patterns of unequal access to ICTs—primarily computers and the Internet—based on income, ethnicity, geography, age, and other factors. Over time it has evolved to more broadly define disparities in technology usage, resulting from a lack of access, skills, or interest in using technology. This article provides an overview of recent literature on e-government and the digital divide, and includes a discussion on the potential of e-government in addressing the digital divide.","Encyclopedia of E-Commerce, E-Government, and Mobile Commerce",2006,,,353-358,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Yigitcanlar, Tan; Baum, Scott",Griffith University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037634725,25,

The problem, however, is that the topic is highly fragmented in the literature, with few attempts to put the parts into a coherent analytical framework. More precisely, there has been no specific attempt to pinpoint the main issues that influence one's view of the importance of the digital divide and the policies demanded by the different points of view. The goal of this paper, accordingly, is to fill this important gap in the literature in an analytical schema that recognizes the ways in which the impact of innovations depends heavily on how they are generated and diffused. At each stage of this sequential process are key issues that influence one's view of the digital divide. It matters a great deal for instance on whether the divide is in some sense unique, or just another manifestation of the general technological relationship between rich and poor countries. It is also the case that the size of the divide depends heavily on how it is measured. Yet another example is that the extent of the potential impact of IT will influence our view of the foregone opportunities associated with limited uptake of this technology in developing countries.",Journal of Information Technology,2007,22,3,284-295,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023752621,46,"[Singer, H.

pub.1043473326,10.1002/jsc.694,An evaluation of conventional wisdom of the factors underlying the digital divide: a case study of the Isle of Man,"The digital divide is defined as the gap that exists between those with and those without access to the Internet. Conventional wisdom is represented by the technology optimists' view that the divide is caused by societal barriers to Internet connectivity such as low levels of education, income and proliferation of technology. The technology pessimists disagree that these barriers cause the divide or that they are important enough to justify significant expenditure by government. This paper reports on a study to evaluate the validity of the optimistic position. The Isle of Man (IOM) was selected for this evaluation because of its size, social stability, high levels of education and income and established e-government programme. The premise of the research was that if the optimistic view is correct, lower or similar barriers to those found in the UK should result in higher or similar levels of Internet access in the IOM. Prime causal factors of the digital divide, as purported by the optimists, were found to marginally favour the IOM. However, the test of Internet access revealed that the IOM trailed the UK connectivity level by some 12% to 14%, which is not as expected from the optimistic viewpoint. This unexpected outcome could constitute a dilemma for the IOM government in adopting an appropriate strategy to e-government implementation and narrowing the digital divide.

To overcome their shortcomings, we propose augmenting traditional software processes to make them suitable for the development of software projects undertaken with a view of bridging the digital divide in a society.",International Conference on Software Engineering Advances (ICSEA 2007),2007,,,64-70,"Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.",Concordia University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094614068,5,"[Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.]|[ur.0667446636.89; ur.01214321552.72]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4554||243-252|10.1007/978-3-540-73279-2_28|pub.1029010882|6;[Ramı́rez, Ricardo]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2001|25|5|315-330|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00007-6|pub.1033162644|39;[Parikh, Tapan S.; Lazowska, Edward D.]|[ur.01164274022.47; ur.01037331540.23]|Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '06|2006|||791-800|10.1145/1135777.1135897|pub.1051882802|83;[Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.]|[ur.0667446636.89; ur.01214321552.72]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2007|241||35-48|10.1007/978-0-387-73697-6_3|pub.1053002316|3;[Brewer, E.; Demmer, M.; Du, B.; Ho, M.; Kam, M.; Nedevschi, S.; Pal, J.; Patra, R.; Surana, S.; Fall, K.]|[ur.0621176610.34; ur.013463377151.21; ur.015672411073.59; ur.011204166163.74; ur.015057310430.44; ur.013327336644.60; ur.010432051166.17; ur.016336613335.90; ur.011033044415.27; ur.07617573671.17]|Computer|2005|38|6|25-38|10.1109/mc.2005.204|pub.1061387336|223;[Williams, A.; Dourish, P.]|[ur.013111427123.13; ur.0775617100.15]|Computer|2006|39|9|38-43|10.1109/mc.2006.313|pub.1061387697|39;[Ross, Philip E.]|[]|IEEE Spectrum|2005|42|9|36-41|10.1109/mspec.2005.1502527|pub.1061429001|17;[Koch, James L.; Caradonna, Thomas M.]|[; ]|2006 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development|2006|||193-202|10.1109/ictd.2006.301857|pub.1094165590|13;[Venkatesh; Morris; Davis; Davis]|[ur.012207572032.74; ur.013005152432.16; ; ]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|3|425|10.2307/30036540|pub.1102515221|16910"

In the last two decades scholars have gradually refined the conceptualization of digital divide, moving from a dichotomous model mainly based on access to a multidimensional model accounting for differences in usage levels and perspectives. While models became more complex, research continued to mainly focus on deepening the understanding of demographic and socioeconomic differences between adopters and non-adopters. In doing so, the process of basic IT skills acquisition has been largely overlooked. This paper presents a metaphorical interpretation of the process of IT skills acquisition derived from empirical evidence. The analysis highlights the presence of three distinct IT skills acquisition approaches, as well as the key role of self-learning. These preliminary results represent a useful starting point for the design of more effective and sophisticated inclusion policies.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4656,,265-280,"Ferro, Enrico; Gil-Garcia, J.

This should include improving affordability through a competitive environment, encouraging the use of radio technology and upgrading village public telephones to Public Tele Information Centers (PTICs).

pub.1000107294,10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x,The challenges of redressing the digital divide: a tale of two US cities,"Abstract. In this paper, we examine efforts undertaken by two cities – Atlanta and LaGrange, Georgia – to redress the digital divide. Atlanta's initiative has taken the form of community technology centres where citizens can come to get exposure to the internet, and learn something about computers and their applications. LaGrange has taken a very different approach, providing free internet access to the home via a digital cable set‐top box. Using theoretical constructs from Bourdieu, we analysed how the target populations and service providers reacted to the two initiatives, how these reactions served to reproduce the digital divide, and the lessons for future digital divide initiatives. In our findings and analysis, we see a reinforcement of the status quo. When people embrace these initiatives, they are full of enthusiasm, and there is no question that some learning occurs and that the programmes are beneficial. However, there is no mechanism for people to go to the next step, whether that is technical certification, going to college, buying a personal computer or escaping the poverty that put them on the losing end of the divide in the first place. This leads us to conclude that the Atlanta and LaGrange programmes could be classified as successes in the sense that they provided access and basic computer literacy to people lacking these resources. However, both programmes were, at least initially, conceived rather narrowly and represent short‐term, technology‐centric fixes to a problem that is deeply rooted in long‐standing and systemic patterns of spatial, political and economic disadvantage. A persistent divide exists even when cities are giving away theoretically ‘free’ goods and services.",Information Systems Journal,2005,16,1,23-53,"Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark",Pennsylvania State University; Georgia State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000107294,158,"[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Internet Research|1997|7|3|170-188|10.1108/10662249710171814|pub.1002872177|179;[Russo, Nancy L.; Fitzgerald, Brian; DeGross, Janice I.]|[]|Realigning Research and Practice in Information Systems Development, The Social and Organizational Perspective|2001|66|||10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7|pub.1019991603|13;[Anderson, Teresa E.; Melchior, Alan]|[; ]|Journal of Urban Technology|1995|3|1|29-44|10.1080/10630739508724515|pub.1021125457|17;[Schement, Scott C.

pub.1005544128,10.1080/13691180600630732,Bridging the dual digital divide: A Local Net and an IT-Café in Sweden,"The Internet is becoming an integral part of everyday life and digital inclusion is becoming a prerequisite for social inclusion. There is a risk that marginalized groups in deprived areas may be excluded from the Information Society, being affected by the ‘dual digital divide’. This paper concerns two community initiatives designed to encourage digital and social inclusion in a disadvantaged area: a Local Net and an IT-Café. A combination of qualitative and quantitative data from a case study in a suburb of Stockholm is used to examine the two schemes in terms of their success in bridging the dual digital divide. Despite good intentions, the Local Net, with its provision of home access to local web pages, largely failed to achieve its goals. In contrast, the IT-Café, with its public access to ICTs, has increased digital and social inclusion of those residents who make use of it. Six reasons for the difference in success between the two computer projects are identified: (1) timing, (2) management, (3) cost, (4) support and training, (5) context of access and (6) project focus. The provision of subsidized public access, the informal face-to-face computer support and training provided by a local resident working in the IT-Café, and the ease with which both virtual and physical meetings can be supported are factors underlying the success of the IT-Café. The paper concludes that access, skills and motivation are prerequisites for a digitally inclusive society. To be on the right side of the (dual) digital divide it is vital to have physical access to technologies, but also to have the skills and motivation to use them.",Information Communication & Society,2006,9,2,137-159,"Ferlander, Sara; Timms, Duncan",Södertörn University,Sweden,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005544128,18,"[Liff, Sonia; Steward, Fred]|[ur.015432352362.07; ur.07710634033.98]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|3|317-340|10.1080/713768550|pub.1000746199|17;[De Cindio, Fiorella; Gentile, Oliverio; Grew, Philip; Redolfi, Daniela]|[ur.014426447065.54; ur.012304474517.14; ; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|5|395-406|10.1080/714044686|pub.1014458066|23;[]|[]||2004||||10.4324/9780203300305|pub.1014861253|56;[Carroll, John M.; Rosson, Mary Beth]|[ur.07616047675.26; ur.01216337450.03]|The Information Society|2003|19|5|381-393|10.1080/714044685|pub.1022367606|48;[Mesch, Gustavo S.; Levanon, Yael]|[ur.016665425115.51; ]|City and Community|2003|2|4|335-351|10.1046/j.1535-6841.2003.00059.x|pub.1031083492|41;[Liff, Sonia; Lægran, Anne Sofie]|[ur.015432352362.07; ur.01155250010.12]|New Media & Society|2003|5|3|307-312|10.1177/14614448030053001|pub.1035478162|17;[Ferlander, Sara; Timms, Duncan]|[ur.0627715457.58; ur.0702464615.15]|Telematics and Informatics|2001|18|1|51-65|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00018-6|pub.1037425397|14;[Kavanaugh, Andrea L.; Patterson, Scott J.]|[; ]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||325-344|10.1002/9780470774298.ch11|pub.1039903495|37;[Kubicek, Herbert; Wagner, Rose M.]|[; ]|Information Communication & Society|2002|5|3|291-319|10.1080/13691180210159274|pub.1042435882|23;[Wakeford, Nina]|[ur.011515642443.42]|New Media & Society|2003|5|3|379-399|10.1177/14614448030053005|pub.1044045061|63;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|730;[Uotinen, Johanna]|[ur.0762234704.44]|New Media & Society|2003|5|3|335-356|10.1177/14614448030053003|pub.1048790217|17;[Hampton, Keith N.]|[ur.012317624303.24]|The Information Society|2003|19|5|417-428|10.1080/714044688|pub.1051395974|121;[Warschauer, Mark]|[ur.01314712222.01]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|297-304|10.1080/01972240309490|pub.1051403945|144;[Blanchard, Anita; Horan, Tom]|[ur.016460421045.25; ur.015050061357.69]|Social Science Computer Review|1998|16|3|293-307|10.1177/089443939801600306|pub.1063873857|161;[Crump, Barbara; McIlroy, Andrea]|[; ]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1106|pub.1072710820|22;[Castells, Manuel]|[]||2002||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199255771.001.0001|pub.1098765389|490;[Wellman, Barry; Haythornthwaite, Caroline]|[]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002||||10.1002/9780470774298|pub.1109492440|422"
pub.1034378460,10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019,"Reconstruing the Digital Divide from the Perspective of a Large, Poor, Developing Country","The global digital divide is usually measured in terms of differences between rich and poor countries in the extent to which they use ICTs in general and the Internet in particular. Such a view of the problem, however, ignores the fact that there are all kinds of ways in which poor, illiterate persons in developing countries benefit from the Internet without any use of computers and Internet connectivity. Most of these benefits occur as a result of intermediaries who, in one way or another, transfer relevant parts of the knowledge available from the technology to recipients in a form that is relevant to their specific needs. Using India as an illustration of this argument, we find that usage understates actual beneficiaries by at least 30 percent. On the basis of this finding, we suggest that a reconstrued notion of the digital divide be based on usage as well as other more indirect forms of benefit from the Internet in developing countries. To this end, much more needs to be known about these other forms of benefit in a large sample of countries in addition to India.",Journal of Information Technology,2004,19,3,172-177,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034378460,27,"[James, Jeffrey]|[]||2004||||10.4324/9780203325506|pub.1109738563|19"
pub.1063002983,10.1142/s0219649202000121,Knowledge Economy and the Digital Divide in Asia,"The rapid rise of the knowledge-based economy has resulted in an increasing gap between knowledge ""haves"" and ""have nots"", a phenomenon now widely referred to as the digital divide. This divide has become particularly apparent in Asia, a region that is home to some of the highest and lowest digital technology penetration rates in the world. Failing to adequately bridge this divide will inevitably result in greater disparities among the economies of the region. This paper provides an overview of the driving forces and key characteristics of the knowledge economy. It outlines some of the opportunities and challenges the knowledge economy presents to policy makers, societies, businesses and individuals alike. Emphasis in this paper is given to the need for assessing ""e-readiness"" as a critical first step in initiating any major developmental effort. This is accompanied by a broad-based assessment of the level of e-readiness in Asia, along with an examination of the crucial link between income levels and telecommunications service costs with digital connectivity. Concrete examples of actions being undertaken by non-profit organizations, corporations and individuals to bridge the digital divide in Asia are then presented, followed by some concluding remarks.",Journal of Information & Knowledge Management,2002,1,01,7-15,"Gleave, Tom; Al-Hawamdeh, Suliman",Nanyang Technological University,Singapore,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063002983,2,

Though the number of Internet users is rapidly growing, there is evidence for the further existence of a digital divide caused by the lack of digital literacy. Thus, the digital divide cannot be closed by access alone and becomes a matter of media education. To find appropriate methods for increasing digital literacy demands knowledge about the ways users deal with computers and the Internet. This knowledge is gained by empirical research in different formal and non-formal contexts of computer and Internet use. This introductory article to a special issue of Research in Comparative and International Education devoted to ‘Digital Literacy Research’ gives an insight into international data on Internet use and outlines a theoretical framework of digital literacy. It also discusses the single studies collected in the special issue. It shows that further research will profit by an international and comparative approach which considers national, cultural, social and age differences between the users.",Research in Comparative and International Education,2007,2,1,1-12,"Pietrass, Manuela",Bundeswehr University Munich,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1069364592,11,"[Westram, Hiltrud]|[ur.012160477257.00]|Forschung Erziehungswissenschaft|2000||||10.1007/978-3-322-97493-8|pub.1024266216|6;[]|[]|The Network Society|2004||||10.4337/9781845421663|pub.1030824724|353;[Schorb, Bernd]|[]|Handbuch der Medienpädagogik|1994|||149-166|10.1007/978-3-322-89931-6_9|pub.1045194258|8;[Toner, Peter G.]|[ur.0636552002.43]|The Journal of Pathology|2000|190|3|233-233|10.1002/(sici)1096-9896(200002)190:3<233::aid-path601>3.0.co;2-s|pub.1052932827|1;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|999;[Marr, Mirko]|[]|Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft|2004|52|1|76-94|10.5771/1615-634x-2004-1-76|pub.1073121471|12;[Riehm, Ulrich; Krings, Bettina-Johanna]|[ur.011732367415.91; ur.013447012705.08]|Medien & Kommunikationswissenschaft|2006|54|1|75-94|10.5771/1615-634x-2006-1-75|pub.1073121622|15;[Kerres, Michael; De Witt, Claudia]|[ur.07477466631.86; ur.011253450623.85]|MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung|2002|6|0|1-22|10.21240/mpaed/06/2002.11.08.x|pub.1100648612|17;[Buckingham, David]|[]|MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung|2005|11|0|1-14|10.21240/mpaed/11/2005.09.27.x|pub.1100650245|20;[Marotzki, Winfried; Nohl, Arnd-Michael; Ortlepp, Wolfgang]|[ur.015673066057.38; ur.014333470031.11; ur.010327603553.36]|MedienPädagogik Zeitschrift für Theorie und Praxis der Medienbildung|2003|7|0|1-18|10.21240/mpaed/07/2003.07.21.x|pub.1100654047|3;[]|[]||2005||||10.2307/j.ctvbkk4jp|pub.1112819160|40"

Prior research suggests that older adults are physically and psychologically disadvantaged when using the Internet. With the existence of the digital divide over different age groups, the objectives of this study were to identify the current status of Internet usage of Korean adults and to suggest some alternatives for solving digital divide on Internet usage. A total of 654 Korean adults, including the elderly, participated in both on-line and off-line (on-site interview) surveys using structured questionnaires. The results of statistical analyses indicated that the gap between the percentages of Internet users in younger and older groups was significantly wide, though many older adults had strong interests of Internet. To reduce this gap on digital divide, with an appropriate help from family and government, several characteristics of the elderly should be considered in designing some age-related web sites.

The social agents in this study are authorities in the municipal government and African‐American adults taking part in a community technology initiative in an urban, working‐class neighborhood. The findings suggest that both participants and authorities adopted a narrow perspective on IT as a production tool to support business‐related skills such as word processing and spreadsheets, which were believed to broaden access to employment opportunities. Despite the rapid growth in Internet‐based applications and services as a justifying discourse of the authorities who create and manage the community technology training program, computer networking was not an important part of the program curriculum. The habitus is used as a theoretical lens for explaining the prevailing perceptions of IT as a production‐oriented tool, why these perceptions reflect the social milieu of urban working‐class communities, and how these perceptions engender discourses that may unwittingly reinforce social inequities that structure the digital divide.",Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,2006,10,2,00-00,"Kvasny, Lynette",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061923741,33,"[Myers, M.

pub.1072709430,10.5210/fm.v12i5.1833,"Public libraries, public access computing, FOSS and CI: There are alternatives to private philanthropy","In January 2007, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) announced its second multi–year technology grant program for America’s public libraries. The purpose of Phase II, Keeping communities connected: The next step is to help public libraries sustain the public access computing infrastructure laid down during Phase I. Now, as then, the goal of the program is to bridge the digital divide. But it is a digital divide as defined by Bill Gates and not the public library community. Situating Gates’ philanthropy within a critical policy frame, this paper considers two alternatives to Gates’ problem definition of the digital divide, and how knowledge of these might benefit those communities served by public access computing (PAC) services as found in public libraries. The two specific alternatives considered come from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and Community Informatics (CI). Significantly, both social movements promote the potential of free and open software as an important part of any solution. Finally, the public library literature is reviewed for patterns in the community’s use of FOSS, and the argument is made for its use in the delivery of PAC services.",First Monday,2007,,,,"Stevenson, Siobhan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709430,5,
pub.1017065123,10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_21,Can E-Marketplaces Bridge the Digital Divide?,"In Australia, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly rural SMEs, are perceived as being on the wrong side of the digital divide. Government at local and state levels have taken a leading role in the development of electronic marketplaces with an aim of improving the lot for SMEs. Many government departments now either own or sponsor electronic marketplaces. Government aims in creating e-marketplaces are often motivated by regional economic development issues. Whilst government entities may think e-marketplaces are an effective channel for implementing government policy a number of complications can arise from this model, not least is being seen as stifling free trade. Despite the community development motivation a major argument for e-marketplace development being put forward is the economic one and this has contributed to a narrow view of the e-marketplace concept and one, which for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact. Government sponsored e-marketplaces should consider the value of on-line business networks to share knowledge and potentially increase levels of innovation.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,,,339-353,"Standing, C.; Sims, I.; Stockdale, R.; Wassenaar, A.",Edith Cowan University; University of Twente,Australia; Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017065123,7,"[van Akkeren, Jeanette K.; Cavaye, Angèle L.M.]|[ur.013621715367.30; ur.015214656367.74]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|1999|3|2|33-48|10.1108/13287269980000747|pub.1019199478|36;[Tetteh, Emmanuel; Burn, Janice]|[ur.010701253035.79; ur.07353464643.84]|Logistics Information Management|2001|14|1/2|171-180|10.1108/09576050110363202|pub.1022004068|95;[Brunn, Peter; Jensen, Martin; Skovgaard, Jakob]|[; ; ]|European Management Journal|2002|20|3|286-298|10.1016/s0263-2373(02)00045-2|pub.1042456448|109;[Williamson, Oliver E.]|[ur.011657615514.15]|The Journal of Law and Economics|1979|22|2|233-261|10.1086/466942|pub.1058751592|5699;[Barrett, Stephanie; Konsynski, Benn]|[; ur.016331146545.19]|MIS Quarterly|1982|6||93|10.2307/248993|pub.1102514625|265"

These differences in the use of ICT and the Internet are part of the “digital divide”, an uneven distribution of information and communications technologies and the benefits that accrue from their use. This article examines electronic initiatives to improve implementation of ICT throughout the world and proposes a multi–level national electronic initiative framework (NEIF) including fundamental guiding doctrines, general directives, specific domain areas of activity, and finally deliverables.

This document describes this gap and seeks a broader definition of accessibility. Accessibility is discussed in terms of 1) usability, 2) a digital divide and 3) evaluation. First they describe how accessibility is traditionally understood in usability design and what issues mobility brings to accessibility. Secondly, equality issues are discussed in the context of a digital divide. Then the mobile learning evaluation framework is introduced and the implications of accessibility on evaluation are discussed. Finally, these perspectives are integrated and future research topics are proposed.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2005,,,281-288,"Syvänen, Antti; Ahonen, Mikko; Jäppinen, Anu; Pehkonen, Marika; Turunen, Hanne; Vainio, Teija",Tampere University,Finland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048159279,1,"[Sharples, Mike]|[ur.012151256767.04]|Computers & Education|2000|34|3-4|177-193|10.1016/s0360-1315(99)00044-5|pub.1009651234|586;[Churchill, Elizabeth F.; Wakeford, Nina]|[ur.07746304547.48; ur.011515642443.42]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work|2002|||154-179|10.1007/978-1-4471-0665-4_11|pub.1020842117|30"

Most experts agree that citizens will need competencies that go beyond the basic cultural skills. Where can our citizens acquire these competencies? The idea of life-long-learning illustrates a major problem of our educational institutions: they work separately, they only process the results of the preceding phase and there is a lack of interconnection. This paper tries to develop a concept of a regional education network that includes pre-school, K-12 and further education, public libraries and community centres as well as other educational institutions. Taking the path of the digital divide as a social and educational divide and focusing on the school as one major player in the regional network, the innovation process and the actors involved in it are highlighted and explored. Using action research in a project between schools, local community, private partners and the university, the concept of the regional network is illustrated. The problems encountered in the project are described and discussed in order to give a realistic overview and impression of an integrated education policy.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,116,,207-214,"Breiter, Andreas",University of Bremen,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041483806,3,"[Rapoport, Robert N.]|[]|Human Relations|1970|23|6|499-513|10.1177/001872677002300601|pub.1005113379|483;[Baskerville, R; Wood-Harper, A T]|[ur.014211036615.49; ur.07776436662.19]|European Journal of Information Systems|1998|7|2|90-107|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000298|pub.1037396829|316;[Brynjolfsson, Erik; Hitt, Lorin]|[ur.016410366727.06; ur.014164101470.22]|Management Science|1996|42|4|541-558|10.1287/mnsc.42.4.541|pub.1064721491|1121"

pub.1026676526,10.1002/itdj.20067,Open access towards bridging the digital divide–policies and strategies for developing countries,"There is a consensus that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) hold great promise for development by connecting people to more accurate and up-to-date sources of information and knowledge. However, the evidence so far shows that the benefits accrued from the utilization of ICTs have been inequitably distributed with most developing countries (particularly Africa) facing the prospect of being marginalized. Inequality of access to information and technological advantages among scientists becomes a crucial factor in formal science, and Africa can be said to be suffering from a scientific information famine. So the key question addressed in this article is, will open access solve Africa's information famine and help the continent bridge the digital divide? This article aims to assess and evaluate the open access movement as a proposed solution to avoid the restrictions over accessing scientific knowledge in Africa. I find it more important that the article outlines the problems that can be observed and what opportunities for building OA in Africa are available. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of strategic and policy implications of these findings for bridging the digital divide and building OA in Africa. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2007,13,4,337-361,"Ahmed, Allam",University of Sussex,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026676526,32,"[Riddoch, Indra]|[]|Nature|2000|408|6811|402-402|10.1038/35044264|pub.1003366765|5;[]|[]|Technological Learning|2004||||10.4337/9781845426910|pub.1027347799|19;[Tagler, John]|[]|The Serials Librarian|1996|28|1-2|171-179|10.1300/j123v28n01_18|pub.1030518855|4;[]|[]|Nature Structural & Molecular Biology|1997|4|10|840-840|10.1038/nsb1097-840a|pub.1037826059|4;[DiMaggio, Paul; Hargittai, Eszter; Neuman, W.

It is argued that there are, in fact, already many more such technologies than most people realise, mainly because what information about them that does exist tends to be highly fragmented.

Discusses the perceived barriers to Internet use and provides suggestions as to how the “grey” digital divide can be reduced.   Methodology: Reviews literature but draws heavily on survey research conducted in Derbyshire and Scotland.   Findings: Although the United Kingdom (UK) population is currently ageing and the use of the Internet amongst adults is increasing, current national statistics indicate that older people make up only a small proportion of those online, resulting in what can be aptly described as a “grey” digital divide. Existing literature indicates that older people are missing out on the enormous potential the Internet has to benefit their lives. Without access, older citizens are rapidly becoming disenfranchised. Perceived barriers to e-literacy include lack of interest, feeling too old, fear of new technology, lack of access to IT, lack of IT skills and experience, cost, concerns about security, and problems associated with disability.   Originality: Previous studies have examined Internet use by different sectors of the population, including older people.

A concentration analysis was performed in order to determine whether the geographical distribution of Internet use in Italy is less concentrated with respect to both the number of existing institutions and income distribution, suggesting a diffusive effect.Regression analysis was performed using demographic, social, economic and infrastructure indicators.

This requires defining sustainability in terms of supporting community organizations that provide social development and related content and services to the public, with support for core services, content development as well as technical access and networking. The authors further argue that governments, and in particular the federal government, has the primary role for providing sustainability funding at the community level to address the digital divide and development goals.   A conceptual approach is required that extends our understanding of the problem of the digital divide and sustainability to the everyday lived circumstances and needs of citizens and their local communities. Such an approach also permits us to consider sustainability in terms of being primarily a role for governments to provide funding to the community service organizations that provide services at the community level in order to address inequalities and under development. Funding should be used for technical services, the development and maintenance of core operations (staff, volunteers, overheads) and content services that can be accessed using communication technologies.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2005,1,2,,"Rideout, Vanda N; Reddick, Andrew J",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133390009,9,

In our project the complex role of commercial activities and forces is emphasized. Firstly, they emphasize the importance of financial autonomy from a short-time as well as a long-time perspective.

pub.1052116527,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_4,American Discourses of the Digital Divide and Economic Development: A Sisyphean Order to Catch Up?,"Discourses about technology and its role in development have been constant themes within IFIP Working Group 8.2 (see the Barcelona proceedings—Wynn et al. 2002). In this paper, we examine how strands of discourse—institutionalized ways of thinking and speaking—shape debate about the digital divide and urban poverty in America. As research is widely esteemed as a wellspring of new ideas, we are especially interested in how discourses inform scholarly inquiry into urgent social problems. As information and communication technologies (ICTs) are increasingly hailed as drivers of industry and commerce, we believe that it will be instructive to examine economic development discourse, which strongly informs the case for bridging the digital divide.First, using Fairclough’s three-level framework for critical discourse analysis (CDA), we reveal that the discursive hegemony of economic development alarmingly constrains approaches to urban revitalization. Linking economic development to the digital divide, we show how the ongoing evolution of ICTs has become tightly linked to economic development. Both are discourses of equality in which those who lack money and technology are cast as needy problem sectors that will be left behind, failing to reap a host of benefits. Hence, there is an urgent call for these “have-nots” to catch up to models of prosperity embodied by the wealthy or technology savvy. We find fault with this discourse because it narrowly privileges money and technology, and raises alarm at their mere absence, while obscuring substantive needs—hunger, homelessness, ill health—of actual consequence. We propose that, in order truly to realize the potential of ICT, we must first reinvent discourse—discarding the mantra of catching up—and set in motion efforts to address self-determined needs, supported by ICT.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,51-65,"Tu, Leslie; Kvasny, Lynette",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052116527,1,"[Mauws, Michael K.]|[ur.010525351320.21]|The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|2000|36|2|229-244|10.1177/0021886300362007|pub.1006029196|19;[Harrison, Bennett; Glasmeler, Amy K.]|[ur.013504472011.20; ]|Economic Development Quarterly|1997|11|1|28-38|10.1177/089124249701100103|pub.1021638643|36;[Klein, Hans K.]|[]|The Information Society|1999|15|4|213-220|10.1080/019722499128376|pub.1025580979|80;[Bates, Timothy]|[ur.011640065667.90]|Economic Development Quarterly|1997|11|1|39-44|10.1177/089124249701100104|pub.1030243996|22;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||399-414|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_27|pub.1030914962|22;[Yapa, Lakshman]|[ur.011577041672.87]|Annals of the American Association of Geographers|1996|86|4|707-728|10.1111/j.1467-8306.1996.tb01773.x|pub.1034841314|82;[Kvasny, Lynette; Yapa, Lakshman]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.011577041672.87]|Handbook of Critical Information Systems Research|2005||||10.4337/9781845426743.00024|pub.1037631474|2;[Moss, Jeremy]|[]|Ethics and Information Technology|2002|4|2|159-165|10.1023/a:1019983909305|pub.1037967441|28;[Fors, Martina; Moreno, Alfredo]|[; ]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|3|198-206|10.1108/00012530210441746|pub.1048224053|27;[Thompson, Mark]|[ur.011565546373.37]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|110||347-373|10.1007/978-0-387-35634-1_17|pub.1048784539|27;[Loukaitou-Sideris, Anastasia]|[ur.016274526065.28]|Economic Development Quarterly|2000|14|2|165-181|10.1177/089124240001400204|pub.1049152503|25;[Gurstein, Michael]|[]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|pub.1072710821|189;[Yu, Hong; Hou, Shuxun; Wu, Wenwen; Shang, Weilin; Zhang, Yichao; Liang, Hongying; Wang, Sheng; Sun, Fei; He, Lihua; Shen, Zhonghan; Huang, Qinghua]|[; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ]|Chinese Journal of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases|2002|20|1|1-4||pub.1076616953|3;[Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[ur.012304503075.13]|The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries|2000|3|1|1-15|10.1002/j.1681-4835.2000.tb00021.x|pub.1099631951|49;[Yu, Peter K.]|[]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2002||||10.2139/ssrn.309841|pub.1102200366|20"
pub.1036529914,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch031,"Digital Divide, Gender and the Indian Experience in IT","Information technology is being perceived as the magical wand and the harbinger of prosperity as it can guarantee access to global markets and enable direct foreign investment and e-commerce. Several projects aim at bringing information technologies to India with a belief in the transforming potential of IT. However, these technologies have created a digital and gender divide. In this article, attempts have been made to look into the digital divide and the constraints that women share by gender specifically in India. India is a multilateral, multilingual, and multireligious society with many subdivides based on region, ethnic groups, class, and caste. The digital divide and gender has become yet another component of this diversity. In India, women comprise 14% of the IT industry and 26% of the business processing outsourcing (BPO) workforce. The total workforce of IT and BPO is made up of approximately 70 million people (http://www.ciol.com). At the lower experience level (about 3 years), about 19% of the workforce comprises women. At senior levels, women constitute less than 6% of the workforce (http://www.dqqindia.com). This indicates that few manage to reach the top level, and the majority of them remain at lower levels as computer or data-entry operators. The gender gap in the digital divide is of great concern as it is directly linked to socioeconomic development. A major developmental issue of the coming decades will be the access and use of IT (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 1989). Policy makers of both industrial and developing countries have agreed that IT is one of the fastest growing industries and is likely to be the largest by the turn of the century (Kraemer, 1994). Hence, if women are not actively present at all levels in this growing industry, then we would see marginalization that could undermine the advances made by women in other fields in the 20th century.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,191-199,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Pande, Rekha",Maulana Azad National Urdu University,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036529914,10,

pub.1001896093,10.2202/1538-0645.1263,Race and the Digital Divide,"In recent years, a plethora of public and private programs in the United States have been created to close the ""Digital Divide."" Interestingly, however, we know very little about the underlying causes of racial differences in rates of computer and Internet access. In this paper, I use data from the Computer and Internet Use Supplement to the August 2000 Current Population Survey (CPS) to explore this question. Estimates from the CPS indicate that Mexican-Americans are roughly one-half as likely to own a computer and one-third as likely to have Internet access at home as whites. The black home computer rate is 59 percent of the white rate and the black home Internet access rate is 51 percent of the white rate. Using Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions, I find that racial differences in education, income and occupation contribute substantially to the black/white and Mexican-American/white gaps in home computer and Internet access rates. The digital divide between races, however, is not simply an ""income divide"" as income differences explain only 10 to 30 percent of the gaps in access to technology. I do not find evidence that price or school differences are responsible for the remaining gaps. I find some evidence, however, that language barriers may be important in explaining low rates of computer and Internet access among Mexican-Americans.",Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy,2004,3,1,,"Fairlie, Robert W",University of California System,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001896093,145,

While in recent years an increasing number of people have gained access to information technology, the latest research indicates that a digital divide remains. Although researchers have moved past the belief that providing access will be the only step required to equalize populations' engagement with information technology, there is still very limited understanding of what factors are truly operative in maintaining the digital divide. What these studies increasingly show, however, is that culture and public policy are elements that contribute to a persistent digital divide. This presentation will focus on a case study of IT adoption in order to illustrate the importance of generating a more complex understanding of how culture and policy can influence usage. The region examined as part of this presentation is Central Asia, with a particular focus on Uzbekistan. Based on ethnographic and interview data, the presentation will discuss early Internet adoption and usage patterns in Uzbekistan in order to illustrate that the uses to which diverse populations put technology is dependent on the interaction between cultural elements and public policies in place.

Using data from the Computer and Internet Use Supplement to the October 2003 Current Population Survey (CPS), I explore this hypothesis. I find large disparities in home computer and Internet access across major racial and detailed Latino groups that do not appear as though they will disappear soon. I also find that ethnic and racial disparities in home computer and Internet access rates are larger for children than for adults. The results are mixed for other measurable dimensions of the digital divide. Using regression models and special decomposition techniques, I find that differences in income and education explain part, but not all, of the ethnic and racial disparities in home computer and Internet access. Language is also found to be an important determinant of home computer and Internet access even after controlling for education, family income and immigrant status. Spanish-speaking Latinos have strikingly low rates of computer ownership and home Internet access. In contrast, concerns over privacy on the Internet do not appear to contribute substantially to racial disparities in home Internet access.",Electronic Commerce Research,2007,7,3-4,265-291,"Fairlie, Robert W.","University of California, Berkeley",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045832991,37,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2005|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Fairlie, Robert W]|[ur.015575246157.36]|Contributions in Economic Analysis & Policy|2004|3|1||10.2202/1538-0645.1263|pub.1001896093|145;[Rubin Patterson, Ernest J.

pub.1072709196,10.5210/fm.v10i10.1286,Is the digital divide between young and elderly people increasing?,"Elderly people still play a minor role in research on information needs and usage patterns of Internet users. Online research and advocacy groups look optimistically at the (economic and social) potential of the active and technology–skilled elderly; other approaches dealing with the social appropriation of technology see obstacles and stress the dangers of an increasing digital divide between generations. Our objective is to refer to taken for granted normative assumptions of the digital divide discourse, highlighting different requirements for the appropriation of the Internet. Using the concept of technological generations we look at formal and informal learning of young and elderly people in the German context. We use survey material and field impressions we gained in various technology related studies. The results show that the ""two worlds apart"" assumption (young vs. elderly people) is too simplistic. Factors like gender, education and socio–economic status still play an important role for acceptance and diffusion of a technology. The diffusion rate among the elderly is increasing, but will continue to lag behind the figures of the young users. Cultural preparations and easy access modes are essential for the elderly, who could make use of latecomer advantages. Informal learning and peer group support will be crucial for the diffusion of the Internet among the elderly. In our conclusions we look at the specific social status of the elderly cohort, which makes a comparison with other social groups very difficult.",First Monday,2005,,,,"Paul, Gerd; Stegbauer, Christian",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072709196,36,

However, many people find themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide that separates those with access to new technologies and those without. Even if they have access to these technologies, some people with disabilities find themselves on the wrong side of a second digital divide that is caused by the inaccessible design of coursework. This paper is a report on the findings of the authors using IT tools for developing a Universal Accessible Web Portal for the traditional and distance learning versions of the COMP1000 Introduction to Personal Applications Computer (COMP1000) course.",Proceedings of the 43rd annual southeast regional conference on   - ACM-SE 43,2005,1,,288-293,"Marghitu, Daniela; Harmon, Chris; Chang, Kai",Auburn University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041376183,1,

The context of the case study is a school. During a training workshop staff at a school was introduced to a community knowledge management system. The intent was for them to use it for lesson planning and discussions. Instead, they built a series of applications that they could use to make the school administration more efficient. These applications consisted of Admission, Library, Store and Personnel Management. This case study demonstrates that the ICT need for the next billion is to provide them with systems that they can customize and manage for their needs. An anticipated domino effect would be that they help customize applications for their neighbors’ needs, thereby narrowing a digital divide caused by the mystification of application development.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,241,,103-112,"Dinesh, T.

Informed by Bourdieu’s sociology of language, we conduct a content analysis of political speeches regarding “digital opportunities ” delivered by U. S. government officials. In this analysis we demonstrate how institutions actively (re)produce and legitimize popular representations of technology and its role in the new economy. The broader implication of this analysis is to offer a way in which information systems research can consider the larger socio-political context in which so many of our research activities and debates are situated.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2001,66,,399-414,"Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane",Georgia State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030914962,22,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2000|41||277-293|10.1007/978-0-387-35505-4_17|pub.1029343048|21;[Swartz, David]|[]||1997||||10.7208/chicago/9780226161655.001.0001|pub.1111930743|1041"

Underestimated for quite some time, spam is now recognized as a problem costing the community billions of dollars per annum. One of the direct impacts of the spam flood is the widespread deployment of anti-spam measures, such as email filters and block lists. In this paper, we summarize scholarly and anecdotal evidence suggesting that apart from reducing the spam load, anti-spam measures are also undermining the email system in terms of reliability and usability. Furthermore, we discuss findings suggesting that anti-spam measures are also contributing to establishing a digital divide between those having a choice as to how they access email (both from a technical perspective and an educational point of view) and those who are not in this favorable position.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2005,41,1,176-183,"Lueg, Christopher P.",Charles Darwin University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010633117,1,"[Cranor, Lorrie Faith; LaMacchia, Brian A.]|[ur.012313770727.30; ur.011613362722.40]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|8|74-83|10.1145/280324.280336|pub.1052310397|177;[]|[]|Choice|2002|39|10|39-5858-39-5858|10.5860/choice.39-5858|pub.1073379959|281;[Lueg, Christopher]|[]|InSITE Conference|2003||||10.28945/2729|pub.1095920861|6;[Servon, Lisa J.]|[]|Bridging the Digital Divide|2002||||10.1002/9780470773529|pub.1109492537|183"

Besides the general issues of digital libraries such as publishing, quality control, authentication, networking, and information retrieval, Indonesia also faces other issues — namely, the digital divide — in designing and implementing the Indonesian DLN Network. This paper describes the basic design of the Network that enables it to handle the typical problems encountered in a developing country's digital library network, such as internet accessibility, bandwidth capacity, and network delays. Also described are the experiences in implementing the Network, which currently has 14 successfully connected partners and more than 15 partners in the process of developing their digital library servers.",The International Information & Library Review,2002,34,2,153-174,"Fahmi, Ismail",Bandung Institute of Technology,Indonesia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038636352,2,

This paper describes these problems and explains how they were overcome in implementing an undergraduate university course. This diploma course has been an unqualified success has achieved its objectives and those of the policy makers who instituted it.

It shows that, despite their shared concerns with illustrating social inequality through the lens of information resource distribution, the two areas in effect represent two overlapping research communities. The research focus and discourse of the former were primarily shaped by three different theoretical perspectives and were inspired by a fairly strong sense of ethical principles; those of the latter, on the other hand, were shaped primarily by four different political standpoints and were imbued with a fairly strong concern for political and economical interests. The co-existence of multifarious perspectives and standpoints has produced divergent, and sometimes contradictory, research findings and policy recommendations, which inevitably perplex researchers and policy makers. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future research and policy making.",Journal of Librarianship and Information Science,2006,38,4,229-252,"Yu, Liangzhi",Nankai University,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028593097,130,"[Kvasny, Lynette;

Rural, minority, and female respondents were less likely to have home computers or to be connected to the Internet. Controlling for socioeconomic variables, the effects of rural residence and gender disappeared but African Americans were still less likely to have home computers or Internet access. When public Internet access was examined, rural residence and gender had no effect but African Americans were more likely to know of public facilities in their community even when socioeconomic variables were controlled.

Design/methodology/approach The paper is largely based on review of literature both online and print.   Findings The paper concludes that the paradigm shifts occurring in the information environment have affected the concept of library; the perception of ownership versus access of library resources; the nature of information resources and services; and the role of the information professional among others.   Research limitations/implications The paper advocates for a proactive strategy on the part of information professionals in order to re‐engineer and adapt the library to the volatile global information environment in order to remain relevant in the wake of new paradigm occurrences.   Practical implications Effective access and use of information will inevitably have great influence on the realisation of positive effects that the new paradigms occurrences engender in the global environment. It is desirable at this point in time to research into how information access and use can be brought to bear on the attainment of MDGs, bridge digital divide, enhance attainment of information society, promote e‐government, etc.   Originality/value Despite, the rapid changes within the global information environment that has been occasioned by ICT, there is lack of critical mass of information science literature that addresses issues such MDGs, globalisation, information society and digital divide from the perspective of the information professional.",Library Hi Tech,2007,25,3,396-408,"Mutula, Stephen M.",University of Botswana,Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021302678,10,"[Wamukoya, Justus; Mutula, Stephen M.]|[ur.011536337053.83; ur.013325104101.71]|Records Management Journal|2005|15|2|71-79|10.1108/09565690510614210|pub.1040442831|51;[Adam, Lishan; Wood, Frances]|[ur.016605630510.53; ur.011142652601.87]|Journal of Information Science|1999|25|4|307-318|10.1177/016555159902500407|pub.1063752236|44;[McClure, Fred]|[ur.015001023447.67]|NIR news|2002|13|5|3-5|10.1255/nirn.677|pub.1064522967|1;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|284;[Neill, Samuel D.]|[]|Journal of Education for Library and Information Science|1971|12|1|20|10.2307/40322151|pub.1102992909|1"
pub.1051286476,10.1080/10572317.2004.10762644,The information needs of end-users of Sub-Saharan Africa in the digital information environment,"The digital divide is severe in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The prevailing digital divide will continue to exist and define the characteristics of the digital information environment of the sub-region as it influences, along with other concerns, the information needs of end-users in the sub-region. The model of information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment and observations and theories from the literature of Library and Information Science (LIS) show that the information needs of end-users in SSA are for information content that is relevant for day-to-day tasks and that is adequately accessible and effectively usable within the capabilities of the information and communications technology (ICTs) that they possess and their level of skill in manipulating the ICTs. The model of the information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment presents the nature of user tasks, the state of electronic resources in use, and user experience in using the electronic resources as factors giving rise to information needs of end-users in a digital information environment. The principles of least effort, satisficing, utility and accessibility particularly give support to the argument of the paper: that end-users need information content that is adequately accessible and effectively usable within the capabilities of ICTs currently in use by the end-users concerned. Recognizing the nature of the information needs of the end-users of SSA will help in meeting their needs as well as in selecting appropriate interventions in addressing the digital divide in the sub-region.",The International Information & Library Review,2004,36,3,273-279,"Kebede, Gashaw",Addis Ababa University,Ethiopia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051286476,6,"[Wilson, T.D.]|[]|Journal of Documentation|1999|55|3|249-270|10.1108/eum0000000007145|pub.1001355032|1024;[Liebscher, Peter; Abels, Eileen G.; Denman, Daniel W.]|[ur.015475712077.26; ur.011164735001.41; ur.013355256401.16]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1997|48|6|496-507|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199706)48:6<496::aid-asi3>3.0.co;2-p|pub.1005317450|21;[Buttenfield, Barbara]|[ur.016623735577.05]|Science & Technology Libraries|1999|17|3-4|39-59|10.1300/j122v17n03_04|pub.1005789644|43;[Hertzum, Morten; Pejtersen, Annelise Mark]|[ur.013520003375.06; ur.07700020431.35]|Information Processing & Management|2000|36|5|761-778|10.1016/s0306-4573(00)00011-x|pub.1009290218|203;[Rosenberg, Victor]|[]|Information Processing & Management|1967|3|3|119-127|10.1016/0020-0271(67)90005-8|pub.1009410869|86;[Harman, Donna]|[ur.012074725244.63]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1992|43|2|164-174|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199203)43:2<164::aid-asi9>3.0.co;2-w|pub.1020102943|19;[Vickery, Brian]|[ur.011455750237.32]|Journal of Documentation|1997|53|5|457-476|10.1108/eum0000000007206|pub.1021052699|29;[McCreadie, Maureen; Rice, Ronald E]|[ur.012010670061.16; ur.014077537323.51]|Information Processing & Management|1999|35|1|45-76|10.1016/s0306-4573(98)00037-5|pub.1031258562|93;[Cooper, William S.]|[]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1973|24|2|87-100|10.1002/asi.4630240204|pub.1032073132|136;[GERSTBERGER, PETER G.; ALLEN, THOMAS J.]|[; ]|Journal of Applied Psychology|1968|52|4|272-279|10.1037/h0026041|pub.1042771211|182;[Byström, Katriina; Järvelin, Kalervo]|[ur.013353642235.65; ur.013327722323.84]|Information Processing & Management|1995|31|2|191-213|10.1016/0306-4573(95)80035-r|pub.1043439094|431;[Kebede, Gashaw]|[ur.016635103325.53]|The Electronic Library|2002|20|1|14-21|10.1108/02640470210418227|pub.1045323053|20;[INGWERSEN, PETER]|[ur.016114421536.27]|Journal of Documentation|1996|Volume 52|Issue 1|3-50|10.1108/eb026960|pub.1051061933|430;[]|[]|The Library Quarterly|1996|66|2|161-193|10.1086/602864|pub.1058808346|383;[Klobas, Jane E.]|[ur.015472574537.43]|Journal of Information Science|1995|21|2|95-114|10.1177/016555159502100204|pub.1063752063|68;[Marchionini, Gary]|[ur.012405116227.61]||1995||||10.1017/cbo9780511626388|pub.1098789585|782;[Murphy, Peggy; Taylor, R.

To do this, we used the registration of Internet domains under the “.it” Country Code Top Level Domain as a proxy. In particular, we analyzed domain names registered by firms. The analysis produced interesting results: The distribution of domains registered by firms in Italian provinces is more concentrated than the distribution related to income and the number of firms, suggesting a diffusive effect. Furthermore, in order to analyze the factors that may contribute to the presence of a digital divide at the regional level, a regression analysis was performed using demographic, social, economic, and infrastructure indicators. The results show that Internet technology, far from being an “equalizer,” follows and possibly intensifies existing differences in economic opportunity in industrialized countries like Italy.",E-Procurement in Emerging Economies,2007,,,161-196,"Pani, Ashis K.; Agrahari, Amit; Serrecchia, Michela; Serrecchia, Irma; Martinelli, Maurizio",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042336736,1,

This kind of gap, known as ‘digital divide’ exists even within a country and even among developed nations. A solution to this problem of bridging the digital divide requires a platform for consuming, sharing, and producing information in an easy-to-use and understandable format, apart from the infra structural requirements. This paper discusses our approach in the form of a framework called Empowering Communities through KnOwledge (ECKO). Our framework includes the processes, and deployment models apart from the software. The framework enables knowledge sharing among the community and fosters the creation of multi-dimensional knowledge repositories. We illustrate our phase-by-phase approach, which is generic enough to be replicated across countries.

In particular, it examines the extent to which inequities in the use of and access to ICT exist among Canadian high school students based on gender, socioeconomic status, and rural-urban location. The analyses suggest that there is a digital divide for Canadian youth in access to and experience with ICT. Rural youth are less likely to have access to computers in the home; however, frequency of use and perceived competency levels are not compromised because they make greater use of computers at school. Female youth and those from families with low levels of parental education are also less likely to have access to computers in their homes; they tend to access computers less frequently and report lower levels of computer skills competency.",Social Science Computer Review,2003,21,4,475-490,"Looker, E.

It will pay particular attention to factors such as the location and size of organisations, and whether there is any support for the notion of a digital divide in the social communications networks and creators of knowledge within the Australian community sector.",Australian Journal of Information Systems,2004,11,2,,"Denison, Tom",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1070994995,1,

Knowledge, information and communication, however, are culturally defined concepts and expressions. Also, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) — the medium for disseminating and communicating knowledge and information - are cultural products of the society that has developed them. Indigenous Peoples have their own concepts of knowledge, information and communication and have developed their own forms of information communication. Therefore Indigenous Peoples need to take part in the Information Society on their own terms and on the basis of their cultural backgrounds, to be able to shape their future without risking to lose their cultures and identities. This project aims to contribute to this process by addressing four major aspects: identification and development of culturally appropriate ICT applications; elaboration of Indigenous approaches and strategies to bridge the digital divide; design of culturally appropriate capacity-building tools; elaboration of culturally appropriate development strategies for utilisation of ICTs for poverty reduction.",IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,2005,161,,237-240,"Deer, Kenneth; Håkansson, Ann-Kristin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044402377,3,

They are sensitising and social learning. Sensitising is understood here as a process through which elderly are becoming aware of the new technology, its existence and its possibilities. Sensitising may take place indirectly through everyday social interaction with family and friends as well as directly through specific, organised events, which aim to inform elderly of the ICT. Social learning refers to the organised efforts that gather elderly together to learn about the technology. This is done in local SeniorNet clubs, which connect to the long tradition of study circles in Sweden. Clubs provide both a place where the technology is available to the elderly and a community for learning about the technology.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2002,2398,,628-634,"Männikkö-Barbutiu, Sirkku",Stockholm University,Sweden,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014466938,2,"[Sadagopan, S.]|[ur.014377154251.15]|Ubiquity|2002|2002|January||10.1145/504689.504690|pub.1063170843|617"

The prevailing digital divide will continue to exist and define the characteristics of the digital information environment of the sub-region as it influences, along with other concerns, the information needs of end-users in the sub-region. The model of information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment and observations and theories from the literature of Library and Information Science (LIS) show that the information needs of end-users in SSA are for information content that is relevant for day-to-day tasks and that is adequately accessible and effectively usable within the capabilities of the information and communications technology (ICTs) that they possess and their level of skill in manipulating the ICTs. The model of the information needs of end-users in the electronic information environment presents the nature of user tasks, the state of electronic resources in use, and user experience in using the electronic resources as factors giving rise to information needs of end-users in a digital information environment. The principles of least effort, satisficing, utility and accessibility particularly give support to the argument of the paper: that end-users need information content that is adequately accessible and effectively usable within the capabilities of ICTs currently in use by the end-users concerned.

pub.1025154293,10.1108/14684520610659166,E‐business and small Ghanaian exporters,"Purpose The digital divide is supposed to place disadvantaged economies like Ghana in a position where using information and communication technology for development might not be an immediate reality. The purpose of this current study is to argue that the adoption of e‐business practices has benefit for small Ghanaian exporters' organizational improvement, and begin a first‐level investigation in that regard.   Design/methodology/approach This study was exploratory and focused on a sample of active, non‐traditional exporters in Accra. This sample represented the best typology of small export firms in Ghana that had been regular exporters from 2000‐2004. In all, 60 firms responded to questionnaires on e‐business and exporting. Analysis of the data was mainly by means of descriptive statistics.   Findings One‐way ANOVA analysis revealed that the export firm internationalization (measured by export intensity) has no bearing on the level of e‐business involvement or perceptions of the strategic value of e‐business. However, export firms who were more involved in e‐business had a higher perception of the usefulness of e‐business to their export operation. One‐way ANOVA analysis also revealed that for the export firms involved in some e‐business activity, the more internationalized they were, the more importance they attached to e‐business as providing some sort of organizational improvement leverage.   Practical implications Given the exploratory nature of this study, more research is needed to study internal and external barriers to e‐business adoption by these firms, as well as the relationship between e‐business adoption and performance.

CHAs were trained how to 1) use the Internet, 2) search for health information, and 3) evaluate online health information quality. An easy-to-use graphic interface website was developed for use in training and as a resource for future CHA outreach activities. After completing training, knowledge scores uniformly increased (p < 0.05). Attitudes toward computers also improved. CHAs found the CHA website easy to use and valuable for training. After 12-months of follow-up, we found that CHAs had infrequently used the Internet in their outreach activities. Despite their improved knowledge, in focus groups, CHAs reported that limited Internet access points, and lack of portability were still barriers.",Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06),2006,5,,1-9,"Houston, Thomas K.; Robinson, Kimberly; Berner, Eta; Panjamapirom, Anantachai; Fouad, Mona; Partridge, Edward",University of Alabama at Birmingham,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093845297,1,"[McInerney, Valentina; McInerney, Dennis M.; Sinclair, Kenneth E.]|[ur.07500255702.53; ur.01132356245.21; ur.013007673035.65]|Journal of Educational Computing Research|1994|11|1|27-50|10.2190/94d0-b0af-nlax-7ryr|pub.1000595395|60;[Chang, Betty L.; Bakken, Suzanne; Brown, S.

The four networks are compared across various network architecture dimensions. Our analysis indicates that LINCOS offers reduced capital cost, flexible architectures, and at the same time access to worldwide information systems, and hence has the highest potential to reach effectively the most excluded population in developing countries. Collaborations among technology marketers, national governments and international agencies are needed to identify the needs of the digitally excluded population and select appropriate architectures to serve the needs.",Architectural Issues of Web-Enabled Electronic Business,2003,,,23-39,"Murthy, V.K.; Shi, Nansi; Dholakia, Nikhilesh; Kshetri, Nir K.",University of Rhode Island,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029259419,5,

It develops a framework that defines four types of information technologies and Internets based on four dimensions of information: physical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. Technologies like e-mail that only make use of the first three hardly interact with the industrial infrastructure and superstructure. Nonetheless, technologies like e-commerce that require the pragmatic dimension, which is related to matter and energy (products and services) need such structures. For example, e-commerce requires a trustworthy transportation and payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, developing countries are lacking them. This differential capacity to use the pragmatic dimension of AdvIT/IS (pragmatic fragility) explains why developing countries are not able to skip industrialization and jump into the information era. This pragmatic fragility increases the existing digital divide since implementing e-business in developing countries ends up being the digitalization of bad business practices.",Electronic Business in Developing Countries,2005,,,1-35,"Kamel, Sherif; Ferran, Carlos; Salim, Ricardo",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019200873,4,

This notion is examined through the lens of information as structured capital that requires Internet access to be complemented by people's information-using capabilities, inclinations, needs, knowledge, and beliefs, which must also complement each other to allow the effective use of information. Qualitative in-depth interviews with 30 senior South Koreans at a Senior Welfare Center suggest that the information capital possessed by these seniors is ill suited to responding to and taking advantage of Internet use. The social isolation of seniors provides them with neither incentives nor capabilities to restructure their information capital in the ways necessary for ongoing use. This finding sugests that digital divide policies for older people must shift their focus from technology per se toward more comprehensive approaches of dealing with the basic social needs of senior citizens.",The Korean Journal of Policy Studies,2007,22,1,113-130,"Youn Min, Park",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141813171,0,

Prior research on Internet self‐efficacy has been limited to examining specific task performance and narrow behavioral domains rather than overall attainments in relation to general Internet use, and has not yielded evidence of reliability and construct validity. Survey data were collected to develop a reliable operational measure of Internet self‐efficacy and to examine its construct validity. An eight‐item Internet self‐efficacy scale developed for the present study was found to be reliable and internally consistent. Prior Internet experience, outcome expectancies and Internet use were significantly and positively correlated to Internet self‐efficacy judgments. Internet stress and self‐disparagement were negatively related to Internet self‐efficacy.

One hundred and twenty questionnaires and interviews were completed with participants aged over 55 in Derbyshire and 353 questionnaires and interviews with over 50s in Scotland. Rates of use, computer and Internet activities, and reasons for use and non-use were investigated. These were backed up by four semi-structured interviews with IT trainers, describing experiences and issues of training this age group. The results indicate a “grey” digital divide, with many older people missing out on the benefits that computers and the Internet can provide. They also indicate some of the reasons why older people do not use computers and the Internet more. These suggest some practical ways forward, highlighting the importance of changing older people’s misconceptions about computers, better informing them about what they are, what they can do and how they can be of real practical use.",Universal Access in the Information Society,2006,6,1,43-57,"Morris, Anne; Goodman, Joy; Brading, Helena",Loughborough University; University of Cambridge,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014087324,129,"[LOGES, WILLIAM E.; JUNG, JOO-YOUNG]|[ur.01001671405.59; ]|Communication Research|2001|28|4|536-562|10.1177/009365001028004007|pub.1000388613|238;[Laurich, Rob]|[]|Collection Building|2002|21|4|174-182|10.1108/01604950210447421|pub.1012456234|6;[Hawthorn, D]|[]|Interacting with Computers|2000|12|5|507-528|10.1016/s0953-5438(99)00021-1|pub.1024264753|303;[Cody, Michael J.; Dunn, Deborah; Hoppin, Shari; Wendt, Pamela]|[; ; ur.010635225665.22; ]|Communication Education|1999|48|4|269-286|10.1080/03634529909379178|pub.1025384053|179;[Namazi, Kevan H.; McClintic, Mary]|[ur.01337033033.64; ]|Educational Gerontology|2003|29|6|535-550|10.1080/713844391|pub.1032907069|53;[Opalinski, Laural]|[]|Journal of Technology in Human Services|2001|18|3-4|203-221|10.1300/j017v18n03_13|pub.1035082067|52;[Blit-Cohen, Edith; Litwin, Howard]|[ur.07372455015.16; ur.0654110156.95]|Journal of Aging Studies|2004|18|4|385-398|10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.007|pub.1036708666|80;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Aging Studies|2004|18|4|369-384|10.1016/j.jaging.2004.06.008|pub.1045693796|317;[Eastman, Jacqueline K.; Iyer, Rajesh]|[ur.011534212311.07; ur.011000003527.90]|Journal of Consumer Marketing|2004|21|3|208-220|10.1108/07363760410534759|pub.1046914301|117;[Mates, Barbara]|[]|Library Hi Tech News|2002|19|9||10.1108/lhtn.2002.23919iaf.004|pub.1061059498|1;[Selwyn, Neil; Gorard, Stephen; Furlong, John]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58]|European Journal of Communication|2005|20|1|5-26|10.1177/0267323105049631|pub.1063796540|105;[Morrell, Roger W.; Mayhorn, Christopher B.; Bennett, Joan]|[ur.01011362020.48; ur.01024437566.48; ur.01261560501.85]|Human Factors The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|2000|42|2|175-182|10.1518/001872000779656444|pub.1067596408|154;[Docampo Rama, M.; Ridder, H.

The vast majority of the world’s population is still unable to gain access to digital technology, especially the Internet, hence the ‘digital divide’. However, this divide is not restricted to the developing world; with the divide also prevalent within the UK, again particularly in terms of internet access. A result of this situation is that while the UK and many of its citizens reap the benefits that the Internet brings, areas are left even deeper in a state of financial exclusion from mainstream banking facilities. As more people take advantage of the convenience the Internet can bring to managing financial affairs, the banking industry has identified a need for less branches and staff. From their understandable perspective it makes more sense to close unprofitable, high risk branches. These are ultimately in rural or poor inner city areas; the areas that are less likely to have Internet access. Advances in mobile phone technology could prove a solution to both.",Journal of International Trade Law and Policy,2007,6,1,21-29,"Geach, Neal",University of Hertfordshire,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1051907587,7,

Though e‐governance is capable enough of reaching to its objective, the problem of last mile connection is still persistent in developing countries due to unavailability of required infrastructure to provide e‐governance with required depth. It has been witnessed that developing countries have deeper telephonic/mobile penetration than the internet penetration. Hence the use of telephone/mobile as a tool to supplement e‐governance in its last leg becomes imperative. The higher level penetration of mobile connection makes the problem of last mile connectivity somehow redundant. Mobile‐governance (m‐governance) may be used as supplement to e‐governance in a spoke and hub model. It will be helpful in bridging the digital divide particularly in rural areas and also in developing parts of world mainly Asia and Africa.

Not only do some segments of the population remain unconnected, but these sectors also have no desire to connect. Thus, the connected portions of the world must create an urge and necessity to connect so that even the most remote location can access the same information as countries with technological enrichment. The first step towards worldwide connectivity involves worldwide understanding, achieved through information literacy, therefore allowing each person to become an independent, self-sufficient user. These characteristics lead to a better education, where the user can reap the benefits of schooling and life experience because of information literacy skills. The most important reward is an overall improved life where the Internet no longer separates people, but instead brings them together for work, communication, and leisure. These goals can only be accomplished through a collaborative effort involving both those connected, and those not connected.

The documents of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) show that the creation of a global information society not only concerns a technical structural transformation, but also a technical implementation of a normative guiding principle. I will show that overcoming the digital divide corresponds to the inner logic of universalisation as an ethical model of reasoning. Furthermore, we will see that in reality this formal approach to reasoning proves to be a means of realising certain ideological perspectives. This interdependency of cultural dispositions and technical developments in the global information society will be shown in five aspects: • The creation of a global social utopia based on the concept of the information society. • The objectification of the concept of universalisation in information and communication technology (ICT). • The linking of global internet use to a normative idea of the public sphere. • The tendency towards totality as a problem of the public sphere and ICT. • Possible reasons for demanding ICT-free areas.",The International Review of Information Ethics,2004,2,,,"Heesen, Jessica",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139274474,1,

While these technologies are being successfully utilized in terms of both service quality and economics in densely populated areas, there are still vast geographic regions where broadband services are either prohibitively expensive or simply unavailable at any price. The article examines several alternatives for using 2.4 GHz 802.11b (WiFi) technology to provide fixed broadband access in rural areas consisting of towns, smaller remote communities, clusters of subscribers separated by large intercluster distances, as well as widely scattered users. Our approach is to model a network based on realistic demographics, equipment and operations costs, service revenues, and customer demand and usage, and calculate the lifecycle economics in terms of capital investment and profitability. We consider the cost benefits of several emerging technologies and architectures, including high gain antennas, dynamically steerable beamforming antennas, and multihop routing. Our results show that cost-effective affordable high-speed wireless Internet access can be provided in rural and remote areas using nontraditional and innovative approaches, bridging the so-called digital divide.",IEEE Communications Magazine,2004,42,2,99-105,"Zhang, Mingliu; Wolff, R.S.",Montana State University System,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061393697,34,"[Kotz, David; Essien, Kobby]|[ur.011452202153.49; ur.01233443471.23]|Proceedings of the 8th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '02|2002|||107-118|10.1145/570645.570659|pub.1039162451|252;[Webb, W.]|[]|IEEE Communications Magazine|2001|39|9|115-121|10.1109/35.948404|pub.1061160231|48;[Gesbert, D.; Haumonte, L.; Bolcskei, H.; Krishnamoorthy, R.; Paulraj, A.J.]|[ur.014273503753.94; ur.011275264460.95; ur.015023010175.39; ur.012126672611.73; ur.012771520655.48]|IEEE Communications Magazine|2002|40|4|86-95|10.1109/35.995856|pub.1061160340|39;[Henry, P.S.; Luo, Hui]|[ur.013434321465.11; ur.012334767222.26]|IEEE Communications Magazine|2002|40|12|66-72|10.1109/mcom.2002.1106162|pub.1061393477|75;[Jones, D.L.]|[]|1992 IEEE International Conference on Selected Topics in Wireless Communications|1992|||240-244|10.1109/icwc.1992.200756|pub.1086277599|5"

From this perspective, individuals from underrepresented groups can make it alongside individuals of wealth and privilege. All that is necessary is education and training, perseverance, and painstaking effort. But if as some argue, it is not a level playing field, then how do various underrepresented groups cope and compete within this power structure? To find this out, a critical analysis of the responses from underrepresented groups to the dominant discourses about power and IT was carried out. A conceptual framework based upon a study of African-American men and women in low income urban communities was applied to the findings of two different studies of gender in the IT profession. The results show a consistent pattern of response across underrepresented groups. In addition, these findings suggest that positive interventions can be applied across underrepresented groups so that IT does not become simply the latest mechanism for stratifying society.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,110,,273-291,"Kvasny, Lynette; Trauth, Eileen M.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001667144,19,"[McChesney, Robert W.]|[ur.014747253342.93]|Journal of Communication|1996|46|1|98-124|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1996.tb01463.x|pub.1040270351|93;[von Hellens, Liisa A.; Nielsen, Sue H.; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.010430272613.33; ur.014147725327.56; ur.07421642022.90]|Proceedings of the 2001 ACM SIGCPR conference on Computer personnel research  - SIGCPR '01|2001|||116-120|10.1145/371209.371535|pub.1049690034|33;[Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.07421642022.90]||2000||||10.1007/978-94-010-9836-6|pub.1052502155|52;[Schwalbe, M.; Holden, D.; Schrock, D.; Godwin, S.; Thompson, S.; Wolkomir, M.]|[ur.07724434733.35; ur.012566437417.50; ur.0664712434.89; ur.010437301503.68; ur.012032242503.33; ur.013425203503.50]|Social Forces|2000|79|2|419-452|10.1093/sf/79.2.419|pub.1060034650|243;[Trauth, Eileen M.]|[]|Éire-Ireland|1995|30|3|133-150|10.1353/eir.1995.0008|pub.1091474799|18;[Norris, Pippa]|[ur.014037134223.28]||2001||||10.1017/cbo9781139164887|pub.1098663486|2039"
pub.1016618440,10.1007/3-540-46422-0_13,Reconfiguring Community Networks: The Case of PrairieKNOW,"The advent of the Web has renewed interest in the use of information and communication technologies to support not only virtual communities but also traditional communities. This paper observes that the majority of successful applications to date tend to use technologies to substitute for and/or enlarge existing community interactions and transactions. We argue that this trend, unfortunately, deepens the digital divide between those who have social and knowledge capital and those who don’t. In order to improve the conditions of low-income residents, there is a need to deploy tools that help to reconfigure rather than simply substitute or enlarge existing community interactions. This paper describes the methodology of asset mapping and the development and deployment of a tool called PrairieKNOW (Prairie Knowledge Networks On the Web) in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois’ Prairienet community network. While Champaign-Urbana was ranked by Newsweek magazine as one of the ten most wired cities in the world, it also has a substantial low-income population that has traditionally been under-represented in their use of Prairienet.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2000,1765,,151-164,"Contractor, Noshir; Bishop, Ann Peterson",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016618440,22,"[van den Besselaar, Peter; Beckers, Dennis]|[ur.012114761217.04; ur.013162221071.31]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1998|1519||108-124|10.1007/3-540-49247-x_8|pub.1003536342|36;[Virnoche, Mary E.]|[ur.07443523421.52]|Science Technology & Human Values|1998|23|2|199-220|10.1177/016224399802300203|pub.1004384054|23;[Cohen, Michael D.; Axelrod, Robert]|[ur.0655711005.06; ur.01233670303.42]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1998|1519||16-43|10.1007/3-540-49247-x_3|pub.1009680474|4;[Malone, Thomas W.; Rockart, John F.]|[ur.0607630534.01; ur.014440025122.99]|Scientific American|1991|265|3|128-136|10.1038/scientificamerican0991-128|pub.1010901087|196;[Malone, Thomas W.; Crowston, Kevin]|[ur.0607630534.01; ur.07357674455.35]|Proceedings of the 1990 ACM conference on Computer-supported cooperative work  - CSCW '90|1990|||357-370|10.1145/99332.99367|pub.1017392093|466;[Contractor, Noshir S.; Zink, Daniel; Chan, Michael]|[ur.0756762664.21; ; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1998|1519||201-217|10.1007/3-540-49247-x_14|pub.1042431689|46;[Chaskin, Robert J.]|[]|Social Service Review|1997|71|4|521-547|10.1086/604277|pub.1058809747|170;[Venkatesh, Sudhir Alladi]|[ur.010766137251.17]|Social Service Review|1997|71|4|574-606|10.1086/604279|pub.1058809749|16;[MONGE, PETER R.; CONTRACTOR, NOSHIR S.]|[ur.015273277007.83; ur.0756762664.21]|The New Handbook of Organizational Communication|2001|||440-502|10.4135/9781412986243.n12|pub.1087892178|390;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0006|pub.1110922859|3;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0010|pub.1110922862|9;[]|[]|High Technology and Low-Income Communities|1998||||10.7551/mitpress/3504.003.0017|pub.1110922869|4;[]|[]|America Calling|1992||||10.1525/9780520915008|pub.1135926927|389"

An Analysis of Two Western Australian Cases,"In Australia, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), particularly rural SMEs, are perceived as being on the wrong side of the digital divide. Government at local and state levels has taken a leading role in the development of electronic marketplaces with an aim of improving SME participation. Many government departments now either own or sponsor electronic marketplaces. The aims of government agencies in creating e‐marketplaces are often motivated by regional economic development issues. Whilst government entities may think e‐marketplaces are an effective channel for implementing government policy, a number of complications can arise from this model. Despite the community development motivation, a major argument for e‐marketplace development being put forward is the economic one and this has contributed to a narrow view of the e‐marketplace concept and one, which for the time being at least, is likely to restrict its impact. Government sponsored e‐marketplaces should consider the value of on‐line business networks to share knowledge and potentially increase levels of innovation. The findings have implications for government sponsored e‐marketplace initiatives around the world.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2004,20,1,1-14,"Standing, Craig; Sims, Ian; Stockdale, Rosemary; Gengatharen, Denise; Standing, Susan; Wassenaar, Arjen",Edith Cowan University; University of Twente,Australia; Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099632717,4,"[Grewal, Rajdeep; Comer, James M.; Mehta, Raj]|[ur.013243536107.11; ur.010100647067.45; ur.014250235776.42]|Journal of Marketing|2001|65|3|17-33|10.1509/jmkg.65.3.17.18331|pub.1003259275|242;[Lee, Ho-Guen]|[ur.016131420050.32]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|1|73-80|10.1145/268092.268122|pub.1005305235|218;[Jarvenpaa, Sirkka L.; Tractinsky, Noam; Vitale, Michael]|[ur.011671157162.31; ur.010235653567.65; ]|Information Technology and Management|2000|1|1-2|45-71|10.1023/a:1019104520776|pub.1006405367|1483;[Bebko, Charlene Pleger]|[ur.012736763405.09]|Journal of Services Marketing|2000|14|1|9-26|10.1108/08876040010309185|pub.1006894731|186;[Stokes, Andrea]|[]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2000|19|1|100-102|10.1177/0266242600191007|pub.1016843083|4;[van Akkeren, Jeanette K.; Cavaye, Angèle L.M.]|[ur.013621715367.30; ur.015214656367.74]|Journal of Systems and Information Technology|1999|3|2|33-48|10.1108/13287269980000747|pub.1019199478|36;[Tetteh, Emmanuel; Burn, Janice]|[ur.010701253035.79; ur.07353464643.84]|Logistics Information Management|2001|14|1/2|171-180|10.1108/09576050110363202|pub.1022004068|95;[Finch, Janet]|[]|Sociology|1987|21|1|105-114|10.1177/0038038587021001008|pub.1024971136|616;[Sherer, Susan A.]|[ur.01326220570.07]|Journal of Small Business Management|2003|41|4|325-345|10.1111/1540-627x.00086|pub.1036528962|108;[Brunn, Peter; Jensen, Martin; Skovgaard, Jakob]|[; ; ]|European Management Journal|2002|20|3|286-298|10.1016/s0263-2373(02)00045-2|pub.1042456448|109;[Lewis, Rhiannon; Cockrill, Antje]|[; ur.013156226255.61]|International Journal of Information Management|2002|22|3|195-209|10.1016/s0268-4012(02)00005-1|pub.1046359333|58;[Poon, Simpson; Swatman, Paula M.C]|[ur.016544440117.34; ur.016563750073.91]|Information & Management|1999|35|1|9-18|10.1016/s0378-7206(98)00079-2|pub.1052707847|302;[Granovetter, Mark]|[]|American Journal of Sociology|1985|91|3|481-510|10.1086/228311|pub.1058547809|18027;[Williamson, Oliver E.]|[ur.011657615514.15]|The Journal of Law and Economics|1979|22|2|233-261|10.1086/466942|pub.1058751592|5699;[Jarvenpaa, Sirkka L.; Tractinsky, Noam; Saarinen, Lauri]|[ur.011671157162.31; ur.010235653567.65; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|2|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.1999.tb00337.x|pub.1061923602|931;[Lucking-Reiley, David; Spulber, Daniel F]|[ur.013065052425.93; ur.013562453163.17]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2001|15|1|55-68|10.1257/jep.15.1.55|pub.1064530114|198;[Bakos, J.

In this paper we examine its manifestation in the area of south eastern Europe which is in a less advanced position compared to western Europe. We use data from 8 countries, collected from local key stakeholders such as government agencies and professional bodies. We use a framework developed by King et al. (1994) regarding institutional actions related to IT diffusion and examine the ones pursued by regional policy makers for the diffusion of electronic commerce. The data are presented by using SWOT analysis with the view to portray the situation of electronic commerce adoption in each country under investigation. A collective analysis of the research findings offers the possibility to extract the ""success factors "" in government intervention in supporting electronic commerce diffusion.

In the early parts of the paper we argue that, although GNU/LINUX can generate substantial savings when used instead of the proprietary alternative in numerous institutional settings, the most telling opportunities for developing countries arise when this system is combined with other ways of reducing computing costs. Policy, therfore, should not only consist of substituting GNU/LINUX for proprietary software in running the latest and most expensive hardware, but also of lowering these latter costs themselves. Later sections focus on the link between the choice of software and path-dependency (i.e. the notion that if one system gets ahead, it tends to lock out alternatives in the manner described by Brian Arthur). We suggest that the problem of proprietary lock-in in developing countries has been greatly accentuated by piracy of Microsoft operating systems and that the result is a stagnation of the technological capabilities in software that these countries need so badly.",Journal of Information Science,2003,29,1,25-33,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036149826,15,"[Lall, Sanjaya]|[ur.010556073043.73]|World Development|1992|20|2|165-186|10.1016/0305-750x(92)90097-f|pub.1043829538|1212;[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Journal of Information Science|2001|27|6|385-392|10.1177/016555150102700604|pub.1063750837|17;[Arthur, W B]|[]|Harvard Business Review|1996|74|4|100-9||pub.1074326125|597"

Useful solutions when trying to “bridge” the digital divide should include collaboration with local groups in order to better understand and meet their needs (Eglash, 2004). The most far-reaching examples of these community-oriented, information and communication technology (ICT) products and services result in social and economic impacts beyond just the use of technology—sometimes referred to as community informatics. This paper offers one such solution where an extremely cost—effective, community-based ICT program was successfully piloted in order to improve the computer and digital multimedia literacy of at-risk teenagers, provide job skills, open up new career opportunities, and begin to improve the overall economic capital of the community. While piloted in an inner-city, the program represents a best practice that is equally applicable to a small rural setting or to a regional educational initiative.

In the context of community health care, scenarios in the Afya project as a socially grounded planning and design methodology have taken the form of personal narratives of Black women that capture their social experiences and typical problematic health situations. Scenarios of Black women point towards the need to foster social justice by nurturing equitable and participative social activities around technological development and use associated with health information services. Scenarios also suggest specific action‐oriented strategies for empowering Black women to build social and digital technologies that we hope will make the provision of health care in our community more just.",Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology,2002,53,14,1259-1266,"Mehra, Bharat; Bishop, Ann Peterson; Bazzell, Imani; Smith, Cynthia",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Parkland College,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007361510,19,"[Chin, George; Rosson, Mary Beth; Carroll, John M.]|[ur.011211010675.12; ur.01216337450.03; ur.07616047675.26]|Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems|1997|||162-169|10.1145/258549.258654|pub.1006477237|41;[Wixon, Dennis; Holtzblatt, Karen; Knox, Stephen]|[ur.014406362352.49; ur.015226645506.15; ]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Empowering people - CHI '90|1990|||329-336|10.1145/97243.97304|pub.1012105833|96;[Holtzblatt, Karen; Beyer, Hugh]|[ur.015226645506.15; ur.016026714052.47]|Communications of the ACM|1993|36|10|92-103|10.1145/163430.164050|pub.1017098166|120;[Plaut, Thomas; Landis, Suzanne; Trevor, June]|[ur.07735451433.37; ur.010533032033.32; ur.011330412433.21]|The American Sociologist|1992|23|4|56-70|10.1007/bf02691931|pub.1021180438|17;[Whiteside, John; Bennett, John; Holtzblatt, Karen]|[ur.012213444525.73; ; ur.015776727125.51]|Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction|1988||Collaboration of UIMS Designers and Human Factors Specialists Computer Graphics, (SIGGRAPH), 21, ACM, New York2April 1987|791-817|10.1016/b978-0-444-70536-5.50041-5|pub.1026977159|312;[Chavis, David M.; Wandersman, Abraham]|[ur.01355724310.64; ur.0732776556.50]|American Journal of Community Psychology|1990|18|1|55-81|10.1007/bf00922689|pub.1027451383|727;[Anyanwu, C N]|[]|Community Development Journal|1988|23|1|11-5|10.1093/cdj/23.1.11|pub.1059456057|18;[Bishop, Ann Peterson; Bazzell, Imani; Mehra, Bharat; Smith, Cynthia]|[ur.014126753237.06; ur.014724333637.32; ur.013014076227.10; ]|First Monday|2001|6|4||10.5210/fm.v6i4.847|pub.1072710651|11;[]|[]|Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction|1988||||10.1016/c2009-0-12113-x|pub.1109641107|84"

The center was one of five computing hubs (centers) of the Smart Newtown Project, established with economic and social inclusion objectives, in the lower socio-economic suburb of Newtown. The project aim was to reduce inequalities of access to information and communications technology (ICT). A partnership approach was adopted that included multiple stakeholders: city council employees and councillors, a communications trust, universities, staff of a computer corporation, and some apartment residents. After 4 years of operation, the center was closed and remains so at the time of writing. Using a theoretical framework that includes Warschauer’s (2003) model of ICT for social inclusion, the concept of social capital, and Oldenburg’s (1991) third place, this paper examines reasons for the center’s closure.

Many rural and Native American communities often have little or no access to basic Internet service, let alone high or even low bandwidth connectivity. A consortium of five tribal museums, culture centers and education programs in New Mexico have entered into a partnership to develop and implement a project that provides a solution to rural communities that lack infrastructure and connectivity. The five sites (the Pueblos of Jemez, Pojoaque, Zuni, the Indian Pueblo Culture Center, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation), located throughout northern and north central New Mexico, are using Access Grid technology that uses a low bandwidth solution (less than 1.5 megabits).

With their support and the support of the University of New Mexico's Arts of the Americas Institute the Tribal Virtual Network is exploring different ways to use AG technology to benefit their communities.

Most schools have incorporated computers and Internet access into classrooms, partly in response to concerns about the gap between technology “haves” and “have nots” ( Facer et al., 2001 ). Such concerns have led to high-profile information technology policy initiatives in the USA (Lentz, 2000; US Department of Commerce, 1999), U.K. ( Selwyn, 2000 ), Australia ( Foster, 2000 ) and other nations. Many families have invested in computer systems at home in order to provide their children with access to the growing body of information available through technology. Similarly, in an attempt to “redress the balance between the information rich and poor” by providing “equal access to the World Wide Web” ( Virtual Communities, 2002 ), the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), Virtual Communities (a computer/software distributor) and Primus (an Internet provider) in late 1999 formed an alliance to offer relatively inexpensive computer and Internet access to union members in order to make “technology affordable for all Australians” ( Virtual Communities, 2002 ).",Studies in Educational Ethnography,2004,Volume 9,Issue see/2004/s1529-210x(2004)9/s1529-210x(2004)9/production,45-66,"Angus, Lawrence; Sutherland-Smith, Wendy; Snyder, Ilana",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034817845,0,"[]|[]|Current Sociology|1997|45|4|115-128|10.1177/001139297045004007|pub.1003919366|2;[Garnham, Nicholas]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2000|3|2|139-152|10.1080/13691180050123677|pub.1006702775|55;[Facer, Keri; Furlong, John; Furlong, Ruth; Sutherland, Rosamund]|[ur.01221066300.33; ur.012574762017.25; ur.010506710607.53; ur.0654777270.81]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2001|22|1|91-108|10.1080/01425690123324|pub.1008103719|39;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2000|21|2|243-255|10.1080/713655340|pub.1010701311|22;[Holloway, Darren]|[]|Australian Journal of Social Issues|2002|37|1|51-69|10.1002/j.1839-4655.2002.tb01110.x|pub.1011500479|11;[Lentz, R.G.]|[]|Info|2000|2|4|355-377|10.1108/14636690010801609|pub.1014492307|21;[FOSTER, STEPHEN PAUL]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2000|32|3-4|437-451|10.1006/iilr.2000.0136|pub.1015083004|15;[Webb, Stephen]|[ur.01110006442.68]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|4|560-594|10.1080/13691180110097012|pub.1025700376|32;[Van Rompaey, Veerle; Roe, Keith; Struys, Karin]|[ur.012206032003.61; ur.014631142243.51; ]|Information Communication & Society|2002|5|2|189-206|10.1080/13691180210130770|pub.1030283629|48;[Reay, Diane]|[]|Journal of Education Policy|2001|16|4|333-346|10.1080/02680930110054335|pub.1030735751|376;[Ball, Stephen J.; Davies, Jackie; David, Miriam; Reay, Diane]|[ur.01263365770.46; ; ur.014740604775.37; ur.011521440757.53]|British Journal of Sociology of Education|2002|23|1|51-72|10.1080/01425690120102854|pub.1043339236|353;[Hellman, Heikki]|[ur.013454453506.13]|European Journal of Communication|1996|11|1|5-32|10.1177/0267323196011001001|pub.1063797549|8"

Understanding the extent and causes of the digital divide is important because IT skills have become increasingly vital to individuals’ economic success. Although IT is widely available in both the United States and Japan, there are notable gender differences in its actual usage between the two countries. In the United States, the gender gap in IT use has narrowed over time, and according to some measures, women are at least as likely as men to use computers. In Japan, however, sizable gender gaps in IT use persist. The contrasting patterns of IT use in the United States and Japan reflect differences in the structure of social organizations and institutions in the two countries. Studying gender differences in IT use across countries thus requires a nuanced understanding of the institutional context under which gender inequality is generated. Using the United States and Japan as contrasting examples, this article examines how gender differences in IT use evolve from gender inequality in broader cultural settings, particularly labor market institutions.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,564-569,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Ono, Hiroshi; Zavodny, Madeline",Stockholm School of Economics; Agnes Scott College,Sweden; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001132780,0,

The Austrian Ministry of Education has left it to schools to define their profiles and to decide about the amount of imparting informatics to their pupils who are aged between 10 and 14 years. This paper gives a short historical overview and some insight into the present dialectic process between autonomy and the upcoming issue of educational standards. A recently conducted evaluation project in Carinthia/Austria, which can be considered as representative for related current studies in Austria, is presented. Empirical research is important. It perfectly fits the ongoing shift from input orientation to output measuring. Whereas other traditional subjects as (foreign) languages or mathematics are based on solid, historically developed fundaments, the comparatively new field of informatics at schools is still looking for stable frameworks. Considering the newest developments, we can be optimistic to achieve a reasonable solution for improving informatics education at lower secondary schools in Austria. Hopefully the announced educational standards in informatics will help to decrease the digital divide among our pupils.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4226,,189-198,"Micheuz, Peter",University of Klagenfurt,Austria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016924201,3,"[Dorninger, Christian]|[]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3422||65-69|10.1007/978-3-540-31958-0_8|pub.1012291716|4"

Despite large investments for developing the enabling infrastructure and the provision of access at affordable prices, however, demand for broadband has not increased the expected rate in many countries. The slow rate of broadband adoption can be viewed as being “supply constrained” in the developing world where countries are lagging behind in infrastructure development, but “demand constrained” in countries where high-speed access is already available to the majority of the population. In order to achieve greater uniformity in rates of adoption and use of broadband in both residential and small business contexts, and to reduce the digital divide, it is essential to focus upon understanding both macro- and micro-level factors influencing adoption and consequent use of broadband. The overall aim of this panel is to stimulate discussion and contribute to an understanding of the diffusion of broadband from a global perspective. In order to realise the overall aim, a number of studies from a range of different countries (including Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and United Kingdom) are integrated within the panel discussion.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,235,,529-532,"Williams, Michael D.; Dwivedi, Yogesh Kumar; Middleton, Catherine; Wilson, Diana; Falch, Morton; Schulz, Alex; Weerakkody, Vishanth; Papazafeiropoulou, Anastasia; Ramdani, Ben; Gholami, Roya",Swansea University; Ryerson University; Trinity College Dublin; Technical University of Denmark; De Montfort University; Universiti Brunei Darussalam; University of Manchester; Aston University,United Kingdom; Canada; Ireland; Denmark; United Kingdom; Brunei; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017295158,4,

Yet, while this measure makes sense in the rich countries, where individual ownership is widespread among the population, it makes very little sense in poor countries. For, in the latter, what we find is that although individual access is indeed very limited, a remarkable number of local innovations ensure that the benefits of the Internet are made available to at least 10 million people throughout the Third World. Many such persons are illiterate, unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing countries. These findings directly contradict the commonly held notion that there are few, if any, local innovations in the applications of the Internet outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer countries with close connections to the former (most typically through multinational corporations).From a policy point of view, we suggest that foreign aid donors and national governments pay less attention to providing individual access facilities such as so-called telecentres and focus instead on ways to foster indigenous rural innovation systems devoted to finding relevant and cost-effective applications of the Internet.",Journal of Information Science,2005,31,2,114-123,"James, Jeffrey",Tilburg University,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063750985,40,"[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2004|19|3|172-177|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019|pub.1034378460|27"

In software design, structured inequalities operate along the main axes of gender, race/ethnicity and class. Each of these in turn generates its own structure of unequal practices giving rise to institutionalised sexism, racism or class divisions/conflict. “Gender, race and class also crosscut each other in various complex ways, sometimes reinforcing and at other times weakening the impact of existing inequalities” (Cohen & Kennedy, 2000, p. 100). For instance, Webster’s research (1996) employing feminist approaches to study computer system designs addresses the issue of a male-dominated system design field, which continuously excludes female users’ needs, requirements, interests and values in the innovation process. She criticises that, “Human factors may be bolted onto existing methods of systems design, local and contingent knowledge of work and information handling processes held by users in an amorphous sense may now even be incorporated into the systems design process, but this does not create an awareness of the way in which skills and knowledge are defined in gender-divided terms” (p. 150).",Encyclopedia of Developing Regional Communities with Information and Communication Technology,2005,,,316-320,"Marshall, Stewart; Taylor, Wal; Yu, Xinghuo; Lin, Yu-Wei",University of York,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040296315,0,

These indicators relate to the Federal Government strategies to face the digital divide. Three main strategies guide the implementation of the digital inclusion public policy: home access, school and community access centers. Effort is made to supply equipments, connectivity, human resources and capacity building programs, monitored by constant evaluation and indicator building processes. Among many ongoing initiatives, the Computers for Inclusion project  (inspired by the Canadian Computers for Schools) and the National Digital Inclusion Observatory are explained in detail. The major challenges are then presented: broadband access in all regions; funds for the maintenance of existing infrastructure; local content production; qualified digital inclusion agents; participatory steering mechanisms for programs, community centers and schools; expanding the numbers of digital inclusion units; co-responsibility among Federal, State and Municipal levels. The conclusion ponders that while many results were achieved in implementing and measuring the strategies for bridging the digital divide, overcoming the stated challenges needs the effective involvement of Government in all its levels in partnership with society.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2007,3,3,,"Mori, Cristina Kiomi; Assumpção, Rodrigo Ortiz",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133391899,4,

Those who can access the World Wide Web have become active participants in the Information Age. Unfortunately, many individuals throughout the world do not have ready access to the needed technology. Furthermore, they do not have the required knowledge and skills to use the technology and cannot participate actively. As a result, this has created a world of information haves and have-nots. In this chapter, after examining the concept of the digital divide, data is presented that shows that those with low incomes and those who are older have little access to technology and the use of computers. Low-income seniors are especially limited in their opportunities to own a computer, and they seldom have the skills needed to use one for e-mail, search the Internet, and so forth, even if they visit a public library where they could use a computer without any cost. Various approaches being used to help seniors learn how to use computers are described, andthen the chapter focuses on two projects that have proved to be successful in this effort. SeniorNet is a national organization that helps establish learning centers around the country. The approach used at one such center, located at Nova Southeastern University in South Florida, requires seniors to pay for their courses. A second project is known as SeniorComp and is supported by private foundation funds. Ten low-income senior citizens are selected for each group of seniors in this project. They are given a complete Dell computer system, and their tuition is paid to take four of the SeniorNet courses. At the end of the fourth course, ownership of the computer system is turned over to the individual participant. To date, the completion rate has been 100%. The approaches used can serve as models for others to modify and use in their own communities. By adopting a similar approach, the impact of the digital divide can be significantly reduced for those low-income seniors that participate in the project. In this way, this portion of the marginal community can be empowered.",Empowering Marginal Communities with Information Networking,2006,,,165-190,"Rahman, Hakikur; Mizell, Al P.",Nova Southeastern University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024956932,0,

pub.1027828840,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch163,Informational Literacy,"Digital divide is a metaphorical division which separates those citizens who can use new technologies to their own benefit from those who cannot. Digital divide is one of the biggest dangers to consolidation of a harmonic development of the information society. Historically, projects are mostly centered on helping people that, either for economical or geographical reasons, are not able to have a computer or do not have the possibility to connect that computer to the Internet. Without any doubt, part of the solution resides in creating new telecommunication structures, but that is not the whole solution. There is more in e-inclusion than giving away computers and putting out more fiberoptics. Digital divide is a multidimensional phenomenon which includes lots of different drawbacks. A great many of them are mental in essence, so they can be avoided through education. The theoretical basis for this approach is to a great degree inspired by the work of the economist Amartya Sen. In Sen (2001) there is a distinction between functionings and capacities. Functionings are elements of technical knowledge towards making something specific, for example, the technical details of sending an e-mail. On the other side, capacities are those pieces of knowledge which include action and social recognition, for example, to arrange a political demonstration using e-mail facilities. The approach against digital divide which does not stop in the infrastructure, does not go any further than the functionings. That is, learning projects which teach the “four pillars” of computer use: Web browser, e-mail client, word processor, and digital spreadsheet. This is by no means wrong, but it is clearly not enough. Any approach towards diminishing the digital divide must take the theoretical approach described by Sen and work toward capacities, not just functionings. Digital literacy should not only be about functionings, but about capacities. The final aim of a literacy and ICT campaign should be to give empowerment to the users, not only the technical knowledge of how to send e-mail to buy tickets through a Web site. By the time this article was written (2005) there were no clear politics going beyond the functioning issues. There are good policies in the US and the EU about “critical thinking”, for example, but almost no policies when the application of such curricula is to be used. National politics, in different European countries as well as in the U.S., is mostly centered in teaching the so-called “four pillars”: basic communication and ofimatic issues. Most countries develop such courses with no further worries in segmenting the target, so everyone (the elderly, women, migrants, and young people) get the same basic courses with the same professors. An important exception are the pilot projects co-financed by the European Union from programs such as e-learning, Leonardo, or e-content, which do insist on the need of segmenting the targets and find novel ways to approach them. One example is using mobile phones instead of computers to reach teenagers better. Another interesting concept, which may seem to become a major trend in the EU in the following years, is the development of the e-porfolio: a way in which students collect all the relevant information and experience for work and are able to present it using this digital format. Unfortunately, there are not clear policies yet, and the efforts towards informational literacy are in the hands of either individual researchers or social workers who want to go beyond those four pillars. For example, such a basic element as an informational literacy test has not even been implemented on either a national or European level. Some American universities have created a quite complete one, but it is neither standardized nor nationally distributed. The same can be told about e-portfolios today. Different universities in the EU and the U.S. have their own system and there is not such a thing as a common framework on e-portfolios which everyone can use.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1083-1088,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Casacuberta, D.",Autonomous University of Barcelona,Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027828840,1,

Lack of access to internet will bring strong digital divide between rich and poor countries and also brings strong divide within the rural and urban communities of a country which in turn will affect the socio- economic development of a country. So there is a need for low-cost information technologies that are suitable to the conditions prevailing in a developing or third world country. Broadband CorDECT is one of the cost-effective fixed wireless broadband Access Solutions used for networking and building knowledge societies in a developing country. It is based on the DECT standard specification from the ETSI. It provides a complete wireless access solution for new and expanding telecommunication networks with seamless integration of both voice and internet services. It has been designed and specified to inter-work with many other types of network, such as the PSTN, ISDN, GSM and more. Broadband CorDECT provides the basic telecommunications as well as broadband Internet services and thus bridges the digital divide and such a service cannot be provided by any other product today in the world even double the cost.

In an attempt to bridge the “digital divide” (between those who have access to information resources and those who do not), the three tier levels of government of Nigeria (Federal, State and Local Government) laid emphasis on rural electrification, thus promoting informative education through radio and television as well as licensing of GSM (Global Systems for Mobile Communication) operation. In Delta State of Nigeria, the wife of the Governor, Chief (Mrs.) N. Ibori initiated women centers. Also, she introduced an interactive 30minutes weekly programme on television for Ibo tomatoes producers. The Ibo communities are known to produce 70% of pluvial tomatoes (available from June to October in two out of six geographical zones of Nigeria). Recently, there has been an attempt to improve the production, distribution, preservation and sales of pluvial tomatoes in these communities through ICT. The introduction of ICT is with a view to replace the older form of ITs (Information Technologies), that is, town crier, smoke piper, drumming etc.This paper looks into the life style of Ibo community that promotes community – based ICT.

Despite many steps forward in social and economic conditions around the world in recent decades, there remain huge disparities in the quality of human existence. We are now at a critical juncture of time and place where unprecedented global flows in information, products, people, capital and ideas offer great potential for radical improvements in human development, but left unabated, they may also serve to worsen and entrench the spiral of poverty which already exists in many communities and countries limiting people to unleash the prowess of ICT revolution and creating a serious gap of information disparity called the Digital Divide. The digital divide means more than just a lack of computers and connections. Technology means nothing if it is not used where the people who could benefit the most are not using information technologies to address the problems they face, not only because they lack the training, but also because government policies often hinder affordable and accessible technology implementation.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2002,8,1,1-14,"Mujahid, Yousaf Haroon",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099624820,23,

In the United States, this problem was already discussed in the mid-1990s. Also in Japan, the importance is emphasized in the general information field in recent years. The wave of computerization of a medical community rolled in quickly. For the hospital which missed the wave, Digital divide is just a life-and-death problem. However, since the minor scale hospital is put on the severe situation by the influence of medical system reform, it is not easy unlike a large-scale hospital or a public hospital, to invest a large amount and to introduce medical information systems, such as electronic medical record system and HIS-RIS-PACS. However, the wave of computerization of a medical community cannot be bypassed and missing the wave means losing the struggle for existence between hospitals. In our hospital, the medical operating support system was built in the whole hospital in 2000 using the FileMaker Pro which is commercial database software, and it has contributed to improvement in the quality of medical examination, an improvement of medical efficiency, or improvement in the degree of patient satisfactory.

This problem is particularly acute in developing countries, where most of the world's population lives. Bridging this digital divide, especially by attempting to increase the accessibility of broadband connectivity, can be challenging. The improvement of wide-area connectivity is constrained by factors such as how quickly we can dig ditches to bury fibers in the ground; and the cost of furnishing ""last-mile"" wiring can be prohibitively high.In this paper, we explore the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. While some companies have used the postal system to deliver software and movies, none of them has turned the postal system into a truly generic digital communication medium supporting a wide variety of applications.

pub.1039302530,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch021,Computing in a New Zealand Urban Community,"Governments and international organisations have expressed concern regarding what has been labeled the digital divide, that is, the gap between those people who have access to, and the ability to use, modern information technologies—such as computers, the Internet, e-mail, and other mobile technologies, often referred to as information communication technologies (ICTs)—and those who do not. As a result a range of measures have been put in place by public agencies in an attempt to reduce the inequities between the “haves” and the “have nots”. One strategy which has commonly been used is the establishment of free and easy access to computing and Internet facilities within communities identified as needing such assistance. In Wellington, New Zealand, a project called Smart Newtown has been implemented whereby free public access to computers and the Internet and free introductory classes are made available to all citizens. The researchers were employed to evaluate the implementation and sustainability of this project and this chapter discusses how, over a period of three years, the participation of women has changed. The questions asked were “How did the women benefit from their attendance?” and “What caused this change in participation?” The article begins with a brief background on gender and ICTs, followed by a short review of the literature regarding the digital divide and community computing. One of the successful computing centers in the Smart Newtown project is then examined from a gender viewpoint.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,129-134,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Crump, Barbara J.; Logan, Keri; McIlroy, Andrea",Massey University,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039302530,0,

pub.1043176603,10.1108/07378830510586748,Bandwidth bottlenecks at the University of Botswana,"Purpose To examine the technical reasons for excessively slow internet speeds at the University of Botswana, to discover the present state of development efforts addressing such examples of the qualitative digital divide, and to recommend remedies.   Design/methodology/approach Surveys of students, the authors' professional experiences, and reports from corporate, public, and intergovernmental organizations provided insights into the effects – and causes – of internet slowdown.   Findings Bandwidth bottlenecks were identified in successive stages of intercontinental internet traffic. Causes included network design and capacity, telecommunications regulations, and competing budgetary demands within Botswana.   Research limitations/implications Much of the literature on the digital divide has stressed plentiful hardware and internet connections in affluent societies versus their scarcity in developing societies. This study illustrates that hardware and connections are necessary but not sufficient for adequate online performance. Technological advance and development can each stimulate the other, and that two‐way interconnection necessitates more than a simple call for more spending to increase developing countries' bandwidth. The paper presents recommendations in addition to higher funding.   Originality/value Student and other micro‐level data serve as measures for the local performance of a global utility, the internet. Tracking message transmission uncovers bottlenecks along the path of the intercontinental internet, specifically as it reaches Africa. These “street‐level” approaches can assist the international aid community, the telecommunications industry, and the public sector in Botswana and elsewhere in removing obstacles to the internet as a potentially important tool for national‐ and human‐development.",Library Hi Tech,2005,23,1,102-117,"Gerhan, David R.; Mutula, Stephen M.",Union College; University of Botswana,United States; Botswana,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043176603,16,"[]|[]|Graefe's Archive for Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology|2004|242|2|189-190|10.1007/s00417-003-0855-x|pub.1002939353|42;[Mutula, Stephen M.; Wamukoya, Justus; Zulu, Saul F.]|[ur.013325104101.71; ur.011536337053.83; ur.011275465570.09]|Journal of Library Resource Sharing|2005|15|3|77-93|10.1300/j474v15n03_08|pub.1014457968|7;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|166;[Ngini, Chukwuma U.; Furnell, Steven M.; Ghita, Bogdan V.]|[; ur.012700541231.93; ur.014122440204.87]|Internet Research|2002|12|4|329-338|10.1108/10662240210438399|pub.1032002181|21;[Warschauer, Mark]|[ur.01314712222.01]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|297-304|10.1080/01972240309490|pub.1051403945|144;[Afullo, Thomas J.]|[ur.015122203603.53]|Library Management|2000|21|4|205-214|10.1108/01435120010317507|pub.1052333825|23"

We in this community of ethnographic praxis, are privileged to move with some ease between corporate board rooms and people's living rooms around the world Yet, our messages and meanings that might lead to positive action are hampered by both our own language — that of development — and the ways in which people hear our language through specific cognitive heuristics and biases. In this paper, we specifically unpack the prevalent business interest concerning the “digital divide”. We discuss how that particular framing, i.e., digital, divide, essentializes upwards of 85–90% of the global population as simply poor and living in developing countries limiting business engagement. We argue that these predilections are further magnified by specific cognitive heuristics and biases we all posses but which are especially powerful amongst the business elite and which must be overcome to be effective. In response, we introduce an alternative scaffolding based on exchange rather than development, a view grounded in Simmel's simple and powerful notion of “exchange”. In the example of development, which we use in this paper, we argue to reposition ICT4D (ICT for Development) to ICT4X (ICT for Exchange). We suggest this repositioning reshapes the possible actions for business possibilities and opportunities, shifting the conversation from hand‐outs to business ventures, an otherwise well understood construct.",Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference Proceedings,2007,2007,1,128-137,"SALVADOR, TONY; SHERRY, JOHN W.; AGATSTEIN, L.

According to Nielsen//NetRatings, over 200 million Americans over the age of two had internet access by August 2004. Of those, 137 million were classified as “active” users who accessed the web pages tracked by Nielsen (ClickZ Stats, 2004a). In the United Kingdom, 24 out of the 34 million who have internet access are considered active users (ClickZ Stats, 2004b). Judging by the proliferation of chat rooms, Multi-User Domains (MUDs), Usenet newsgroups, message boards, and electronic mailing lists, what is being sought out is not only information and/or entertainment but interaction with others using both synchronous and asynchronous forms of communication. Scholarly investigation of computer-mediated communication has drawn attention to the complex ways inwhich identity and community are produced in a range of cyberspaces. While a body of literature that critically examines issues of gender and to a lesser extent, race and sexuality, has taken form, little has been written about class beyond the digital divide between the information “rich” and “poor”. At its broadest, this chapter is an attempt to map out the performance (Butler, 1990) of gender, sexuality, and class on an electronic mailing list made up of fans of the Canadian television series Due South (DS).",The International Handbook of Virtual Learning Environments,2006,,,1151-1167,"Bury, Rhiannon",University of Waterloo,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045063911,0,

The deployment of highspeed (or broadband) Internet networks is integral for ICT diffusion generally, and in particular the availability broadband service.1 Broadband networks, as a general purpose technology, have the capability to deliver benefit to many economic sectors. That is, broadband networks can provide a vehicle to deliver, e.g., government, education, cultural and health services. Given the potential social dividend obtained from broadband technology use, it is important to ensure that this technology is widely diffused within nations—and not concentrated at the main, typically urban, national economic hubs. With broadband technology penetration increasing in urban areas, several OECD Member Country governments are addressing potential national broadband digital divide issues, viz., that national divides may develop should broadband service not be made readily available to rural and remotely located populations. Accordingly, this study provides an overview of broadband network developments within OECD Member Countries, and analyzes recent Member Country national broadband policy. Subsequent to this review, the potential for intra-Member Country national digital divides to emerge is considered, as are national initiatives to provide high-speed access to rural and remote populations. The chapter concludes with recommendations for policy makers.",Contributions to Economics,2004,,,303-313,"Ypsilanti, Dimitri; Paltridge, Sam",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016538435,0,[OECD]|[]||2003||||10.1787/232788646665|pub.1107155385|6

The focus of the Japanese local telecommunications policy is shifting towards solving the problem of the digital divide that accompanies the spread of high‐speed and broadband services. The article estimates a translog cost function of two outputs – the standard telephone service and the leased circuit service – and measures the regional gap of those stand‐alone costs and incremental costs. The main point we make is that the cost gap for the leased circuit service is larger than that for the standard telephone service among the 11 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) regional offices.,Papers of the Regional Science Association,2005,84,2,183-199,"Ida, Takanori; Asai, Sumiko",Kyoto University; Otsuma Women's University,Japan; Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010670540,3,"[Resende, Marcelo]|[ur.010647117317.17]|Information Economics and Policy|1999|11|1|23-44|10.1016/s0167-6245(98)00020-1|pub.1001012129|23;[Bohlin, Erik]|[ur.013334133323.32]|Telecommunications Policy|1997|21|2|79-84|10.1016/s0308-5961(97)83763-9|pub.1015822569|7;[Palmer, Karen]|[]|Economics Letters|1991|35|4|457-460|10.1016/0165-1765(91)90019-h|pub.1019336036|6;[Khaled, M.; Adams, M.

pub.1013370723,10.1145/1008213.1008223,The content digital divide,"Dear Editor-in-Chief, I would like to describe briefly how the non-profit kindersite project is utilizing digital media content in an innovative way to address social problems. Firstly to answer who we are; the two founders are Ziv Avidor, a technology specialist and consultant to government and corporations and Joel Josephson, an Internet strategist and high tech consultant. Our concept is to use content on a wide-scale over the Internet or within control groups to understand what constitutes effective and engaging digital content. This will be achieved through quantitative and qualitative research of users usage of the content. Our belief is that a bottom-up investigation will achieve focused and constructive results that will help raise the effectiveness and outcomes of content usage within the social causes targeted. Initially the team have implemented their ideas in two social projects involving education and the digital divide. The education project is targeted at gaining answers to the many and critical questions that surround the introduction of technology to early learners (ages 2 to 8) plus answering similar questions regarding the introduction of digital content for the teaching of English as a second language. This, more advanced project, is based around an Internet site http://www.kindersite.org that offers educators and parents of small children a free resource of 1,000s of links to content in the form of games, songs and stories. The content is being graded according to educational and appropriateness parameters. This project is currently being used globally with 152 officially participating schools in 27 countries plus registrations from about 80 countries. The second project utilizes an adaptation of the existing technology and focuses on the Content Digital Divide. This project will study how the effectiveness of introducing technology (computers and the Internet) to digitally divided communities can be improved. The project looks at the introduction to technology from a content perspective and will attempt to ensure that the recipients of the new technology are made fully aware from the first exposure, of the personal and community benefits of technology. The commissioning of content or adaptation will be completed on a local level with the additional purpose of stimulating growth in locally-based content providers. This proposal has gained the support of potential implementing partners in a number of developing countries including, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Nigeria, Cameroon, Kazakhstan, India etc. We are now looking to gain corporate and governmental support to help implement these projects on the scale we envisage and be very interested in the comments, sponsorship or practical help of your readership.

pub.1021682107,10.1108/eb045791,Towards bridging the digital divide for all‐round socio‐economic development in India of the 21st century,"The idea of connecting rural India to the world has captured the imagination of journalists, scholars, non‐governmental organizations, digital pioneers, and the corporate sectors. The revolution in information technology (IT) has transformed the world into a global society in a short time. To promote IT industry, the Indian Government established a Working Group on Information Technology for the Masses. If any technology can create new opportunities to bridge the gap between haves and have nots in society in the present times, it is IT says the background report of this Working Group on Information Technology for the Masses. In no country is the debate between the optimists and the pessimists more relevant than in India, where new centers of information technology are creating wealth and integrating some sectors into the global economy, while millions remain marginalized and deprived of the most basic human needs. On the other side of the digital divide are the 45 percent of the population who cannot read or write (57 percent of the female population), the 44 percent who survive on less than $1 per day, and those who live in the 370,000 villages that do not have telephone connections. Noting the irony of such sharp contrasts, the former President of India, Narayan lamented in a speech on the eve of the country's fiftieth anniversary as a republic that India has one of the world's largest reservoirs of trained technical personnel but also one of the world's largest number of illiterates, the largest number of people below the poverty line, and the largest number of children suffering from malnutrition. The fact remains that no developing country has benefited more from the digital revolution than India, and in no country is the digital divide wider or deeper. In the words of Bill Gates in which recently he pointed out, what good a computer is for someone who survives on 1$ per day, whose main concern is the next meal. It is a fact that in India the impact of information technology has not reached every sphere of activity or every individual yet India has made a good deal of contribution in this field and has risen to considerable eminence in the world. Information Technology has created a new and dynamic economic sector, generating significant employment and wealth. It is therefore necessary to see how we can bridge this divide that is shaping between the digitally rich and the digitally poor nations, institutions and individuals. The essential nature of the development process is the progressive development of social organizations and institutions that harness and direct the society's energies and material resources for higher levels of accomplishment.",Social Responsibility Journal,2005,Volume 1,Issue 1/2,21-23,"L.Buam, Deborah",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021682107,0,

Design/methodology/approach A survey research method was used in the study to collect qualitative and quantitative data from actual and potential Telecentre users in relevant communities. The study was carried out through a survey. The primary sample comprised of 30 percent of the Telecentres. The secondary sample included users and potential users around the Telecentres. The total number of users and potential users was 338. The study was conducted from early January 2005 to the of end February 2006.   Findings The survey data disclosed that still only a small percentage of the total population are aware of Telecentres and use the facilities offered by them. The crucial factor affecting usage is language. According to the majority of respondents, as they understand only native languages they have not benefited from services such as like the internet and e‐mail. The content or the information that can be offered through Telecentres plays a pivotal role in this regard. Out of the 70 percent of rural population, the majority are not familiar with the English language. Therefore, Sinhala‐ and Tamil‐speaking people are disadvantaged. The survey data confirms that all Telecentres are highly (100 per cent) dependent on subsidies provided by ICTA. Hence, the sustainability of Telecentres is questionable at present.   Research limitations/implications The Telecentres situated in the North East region had to be excluded from the study due to the resumption of hostilities between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and a corresponding lack of access and security in the region. The North East Province contains 9.84 per cent of Telecentres set up under the project.   Practical implications The findings of the study will help policy makers, decision makers and donors to properly address the key issues such as connectivity, accessibility, content and services, sustainability, skills development, partnerships with stakeholders and the needs of disadvantaged groups. Further, the problems and successes identified by the study will be useful for policy and decision makers to ensure the sustainability of the Telecentres and how the e‐Sri Lanka initiative and especially the 1,000 Telecentre project could be used to narrow the digital divide in Sri Lanka.   Originality/value This will be the first in‐depth study on the Telecentres, which are one of the major components of the government's e‐Sri Lanka initiative.

The strategic slogan is “Age old problems, Youthful movement”. Gender equality is sought in the context of the fight against a digital divide that is expressed through the problems of underdevelopment and exclusion. The approach is based on introduction of organizational innovations to raise human capital and social capital in the rural communities and connect them with each other and the world over through a knowledge network. In the hands of women, this becomes a weapon to fight against gender inequality and discrimination. Through the use of information technology, a community centric approach can help rural India to combat social problems. In contemporary times where information, knowledge is the key to development and progress, IT can be used to combat the development concerns of rural India, while keeping local communities and their involvement and empowerment at the forefront of the process. As a technology IT is best suited for the “gendered” sex to empower themselves with education, information, knowledge, skills and so forth, and connect themselves with other rural communities and overcome physical isolation through IT network. For resolution of gender problem, individualized IT empowerment has extremely marginal relevance, whereas tele-center like models based on private proprietorship has also very little success. IT Enabled Women’s Social Network can be a solution in bridging the digital divide and gender problem. 1V1C campaign shows that it is possible to build such networks in remote villages and reach the most downtrodden and even illiterate women.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,838-843,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Shaligram, Anil",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037721389,0,

During the same time period, society began to move towards providing equity for people with disabilities. As legislators around the world created new disability and Information Technology policies, more people with disabilities were given access to education and the evolving computing tools provided unprecedented educational opportunities. These opportunities were due to the use of new technologies such as outputting of electronic text to voice synthesizers. The provision of assistive technology was not only helpful; it also provided education through a medium that was previously unavailable, particular to the blind and vision impaired. For much of the 1980s the development of text-processing sensory technologies, connected to personal computers, led to a closer equality between the educational services of the able-bodied and people with disabilities.Unfortunately this evolution as not without notable difficulties: issues surrounding the cost of products, the lack of support from large corporations and choice of platform resulted in substantial difficulties for educators in the assessment of appropriate technology. In addition, many of these products became largely redundant in the late-1980s as corporations began to place more emphasis on the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Although the GUI was remarkably successful in allowing the general public to gain better access to personal computing, it’s non-text nature once again caused a digital divide for people with disabilities. Although it is clear that the evolution of the personal computer has had a significant impact on the provision of education for people with disabilities, this paper highlights the historical repetition where innovation is prioritized above e-inclusion.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2004,145,,123-131,"Hollier, Scott; Murray, Iain",Curtin University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025590220,5,"[Levtzion‐Korach, O; Tennenbaum, A; Schnitzer, R; Ornoy, A]|[ur.01257737370.02; ur.01364532354.41; ; ur.074156016.49]|Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health|2000|36|3|226-229|10.1046/j.1440-1754.2000.00501.x|pub.1020975008|70;[Dorman, S M]|[ur.01003114607.24]|Journal of School Health|1998|68|3|120-123|10.1111/j.1746-1561.1998.tb03497.x|pub.1027257453|7;[Ross, G; Lipper, E G; Abramson, D; Preiser, L]|[ur.0614626164.75; ur.0662741364.70; ur.01356217050.20; ur.07667000237.85]|JAMA Pediatrics|2001|155|1|80-83|10.1001/archpedi.155.1.80|pub.1030888602|33;[Bricout, John C.]|[]|Journal of Social Work Education|2001|37|2|267-281|10.1080/10437797.2001.10779053|pub.1101357581|9"

The value of the information provided by a service such as Shopper.com depends on the size of the market, which is consistent with a variety of theories. When two firms list prices, consumers save 11% by purchasing at the lowest price rather than at the average price. These savings jump to 20% when more than 30 firms list prices. However, the potential savings accrue only to consumers on the “right” side of the digital divide.",Journal of Public Policy & Marketing,2003,22,1,17-25,"Baye, Michael R.; Morgan, John; Scholten, Patrick","Indiana University; University of California, Berkeley; Bentley University",United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043533189,68,"[Resnick, Paul; Zeckhauser, Richard]|[ur.01132242673.62; ur.0775407467.49]|Advances in Applied Microeconomics|2002|11||127-157|10.1016/s0278-0984(02)11030-3|pub.1016311769|1042;[Shilony, Yuval]|[ur.014445621607.45]|Journal of Economic Theory|1977|14|2|373-388|10.1016/0022-0531(77)90137-5|pub.1020814864|154;[Baylis, Kathy; Perloff, Jeffrey M.]|[ur.0726312040.96; ur.01366126414.31]|Review of Industrial Organization|2002|21|3|305-324|10.1023/a:1020415304514|pub.1023777386|126;[Ward, Michael R.; Lee, Michael J.]|[; ]|Journal of Product & Brand Management|2000|9|1|6-20|10.1108/10610420010316302|pub.1025161401|190;[Baye, Michael R.; Morgan, John]|[ur.010300426541.38; ur.016523117567.07]|Economics Letters|2002|76|1|47-51|10.1016/s0165-1765(02)00028-9|pub.1031312013|33;[Scholten, Patrick; Smith, S.

In this paper, we propose a novel ""Wake-on-WLAN"" mechanism for coarse-grained, on-demand power on/off of the networking equipment at a remote site. The novelty also lies in our implementation of a prototype system using low-power 802.15.4-based sensor motes. We describe the prototype, as well as its evaluation on field in a WiFi testbed.

The substantial variation observed in access price may largely have a spatial explanation. The analysis also suggests that the simple subscription decision is only modestly sensitive to price implying access subsidies for basic access are unlikely to be a highly effective tool in bridging the “digital divide”.",Telecommunications Policy,2005,29,9-10,731-755,"Chaudhuri, Anindya; Flamm, Kenneth S.; Horrigan, John",University of Colorado Boulder; Federal Communications Commission,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027604222,130,"[Gillett, Sharon Eisner]|[ur.014205054675.54]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|147-149|10.1080/01972240050032906|pub.1007433536|13;[Goldfarb, Avi]|[ur.0636245456.94]|International Journal of Industrial Organization|2006|24|2|203-225|10.1016/j.ijindorg.2005.11.004|pub.1009265685|42;[Kridel, Donald J.; Rappoport, Paul N.; Taylor, Lester D.]|[ur.014625526672.24; ur.07631342331.00; ur.011222220665.42]|Topics in Regulatory Economics and Policy|1999|||21-41|10.1007/978-1-4615-4643-6_3|pub.1022003746|21;[Berry, Steven; Levinsohn, James; Pakes, Ariel]|[ur.01261045077.08; ur.01335666214.61; ur.0750225604.91]|Econometrica|1995|63|4|841|10.2307/2171802|pub.1069804358|2708;[Gillett, Sharon E.; Lehr, William]|[ur.014205054675.54; ur.016001202377.84]|SSRN Electronic Journal|1999||||10.2139/ssrn.3215923|pub.1106075404|13"

On the basis of field research in Botswana, it finds that poor rural entrepreneurs rely heavily on informal, social and local information systems. While highly appropriate in many ways, these systems can also be constrained and insular. Priorities for breaking this insularity will be greater access to shared telephone services. ICTs may play a supplementary role. They will need to be based in intermediary organizations that can provide complementary inputs of finance, skills, knowledge and other resources.

This study of 120 persons with HIV/AIDS in the U.S. found approximately 19% used the Internet for HIV/AIDS-related purposes, much lower than the rate for general Internet use among the U.S. population. Lower incomes were associated with lower rates of use, echoing the “digital divide” found in the general population. Access from home was most common and information sought was primarily on medical treatments and medications. Possible reasons for low access rates, strategies for increasing access, and implications for other client groups are discussed.",Journal of Technology in Human Services,2004,22,2,17-29,"Smith, Laurie A.","California State University, San Bernardino",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042654347,3,"[Blundo, Robert G.; Mele, Christopher; Hairston, Rhonda; Watson, Josephine]|[ur.0665674171.23; ; ; ]|Journal of Community Practice|1999|6|2|11-26|10.1300/j125v06n02_02|pub.1006427774|2;[Mechanic, David]|[ur.0600471337.06]|Social Science & Medicine|1999|48|6|711-718|10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00399-2|pub.1007883578|32;[Perry, Gerald]|[]|Journal of Consumer Health on the Internet|1998|2|2-3|39-51|10.1300/j138v02n02_05|pub.1010895111|3;[MLS, Janet A.

As a consequence, additional findings on cultural influences on Web site design, related structural design criteria, basic conditions, and complementary criteria for culturally appropriate websites are discussed that may impact the future of the Digital Divide.",Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,2005,11,1,192-216,"Hermeking, Marc",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044588393,134,"[Jacobs, Laurence; Keown, Charles; Worthley, Reginald; Ghymn, Kyung‐Il]|[ur.015102227311.30; ur.016135523606.60; ur.012216376365.20; ur.010311454267.83]|International Marketing Review|1991|Volume 8|Issue 3||10.1108/02651339110137279|pub.1002766532|125;[Holden, Nigel]|[ur.016340627321.30]|International Marketing Review|2004|21|6|563-572|10.1108/02651330410568015|pub.1005102574|45;[Deleersnyder, Barbara; Geyskens, Inge; Gielens, Katrijn; Dekimpe, Marnik G]|[ur.07624277370.11; ur.016250505425.26; ur.014213527161.28; ur.012747052606.79]|International Journal of Research in Marketing|2002|19|4|337-348|10.1016/s0167-8116(02)00099-x|pub.1005593157|237;[Park, Cheol; Jun, Jong‐Kun]|[ur.012737041667.14; ur.015055256213.98]|International Marketing Review|2003|20|5|534-553|10.1108/02651330310498771|pub.1008897379|274;[de Mooij, Marieke]|[ur.012370130123.25]|International Marketing Review|2000|17|2|103-113|10.1108/02651330010322598|pub.1010253534|111;[Yeniyurt, Sengun; Townsend, Janell D.]|[ur.012732271435.19; ur.011367103440.66]|International Marketing Review|2003|20|4|377-396|10.1108/02651330310485153|pub.1020030857|191;[Knight, Gary A.; Calantone, Roger J.]|[ur.013230651733.59; ur.016224174322.06]|International Marketing Review|2000|17|2|127-145|10.1108/02651330010322615|pub.1020466523|174;[Okazaki, Shintaro; Alonso, Javier]|[ur.011313476037.27; ]|Journal of Marketing Communications|2003|9|4|221-239|10.1080/1352726032000129908|pub.1021038143|9;[Madden, Thomas J.; Hewett, Kelly; Roth, Martin S.]|[ur.011445043735.90; ur.013154003043.79; ur.015573560567.49]|Journal of International Marketing|2000|8|4|90-107|10.1509/jimk.8.4.90.19795|pub.1023526584|331;[Baalbaki, Imad B.; Malhotra, Naresh K.]|[ur.015471662103.28; ur.014233622215.29]|International Marketing Review|1993|Volume 10|Issue 1||10.1108/02651339310025839|pub.1030003341|120;[Okazaki, Shintaro]|[ur.011313476037.27]|European Journal of Marketing|2005|39|1/2|87-109|10.1108/03090560510572034|pub.1036592308|41;[Meffert, Heribert; Bruhn, Manfred]|[ur.011653762164.84; ur.011520452775.96]||1993||||10.1007/978-3-322-84759-1|pub.1049142047|9;[Singh, Nitish; Baack, Daniel W.]|[ur.012723715766.20; ur.010753070171.56]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|9|4|00-00|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00298.x|pub.1061923734|59;[Rhee, Kyung Yong; Kim, Wang‐Bae]|[; ]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|9|4|00-00|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00299.x|pub.1061923735|46;[Galtung, Johan]|[]|Social Science Information|1981|20|6|817-856|10.1177/053901848102000601|pub.1063831125|155;[Steenkamp, Jan-Benedict E.

pub.1029078126,10.1002/jid.864,Information literacy needs of local staff in cross‐cultural development projects,"Information literacy is about people's information practices in their information and communication technology (ICT) environment. Increasing access to ICTs to bridge the digital divide has implications for the information literacy needs of people in developing communities. The research described in this paper investigated development workers' perceptions of information literacy needs amongst local staff participating in community development projects in cross-cultural situations. A phenomenographic approach was used to elicit five hierarchically related, qualitatively different understandings of information literacy needs within the development context. The results reveal possible directions for those involved in bringing ICTs into workplace settings within developing communities.

It reflects on the potential for policy makers in developing countries to steer technological transformation towards ‘desirable’ ends and assesses the contribution of diverse parties and factors to the acceptance or otherwise of ICTs. The study finds that where policy makers ignore the multi-level, multi-actor processes by which technology and society co-evolve, opportunities may be missed to render the use of ICTs meaningful to would-be users. This is turn may retard economic development related to the growth of the information society and e-business.",Asia Pacific Business Review,2007,13,1,95-112,"GENUS, AUDLEY; NOR, MOHD ALI MOHAMAD",Newcastle University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019662258,6,"[Driel, H. van (Hugo); Schot, Johan]|[; ur.01273430027.28]|Technology and Culture|2005|46|1|51-76|10.1353/tech.2005.0011|pub.1006052534|82;[Smith, Adrian; Stirling, Andy; Berkhout, Frans]|[ur.015033212123.27; ur.0706644040.48; ur.015425523671.58]|Research Policy|2005|34|10|1491-1510|10.1016/j.respol.2005.07.005|pub.1006824052|1272;[van den Ende, Jan; Kemp, René]|[ur.012242550027.87; ur.016262352213.27]|Research Policy|1999|28|8|833-851|10.1016/s0048-7333(99)00027-x|pub.1009304787|72;[Nelson, Richard R.; Winter, Sidney G.]|[ur.012450212716.46; ur.016441610465.06]|Research Policy|1977|6|1|36-76|10.1016/0048-7333(77)90029-4|pub.1014690894|1274;[Geels, Frank]|[ur.0615616770.33]|Technology in Society|2005|27|3|363-397|10.1016/j.techsoc.2005.04.008|pub.1016313104|201;[Raven, Rob; Verbong, Geert]|[ur.0651162727.65; ur.013315534021.76]|Technology and Culture|2004|45|3|519-539|10.1353/tech.2004.0149|pub.1016468180|10;[Nelson, Richard R.; Winter, Sidney G.]|[ur.012450212716.46; ur.016441610465.06]|Interdisciplinary Systems Research|1977|||215-245|10.1007/978-3-0348-5867-0_14|pub.1021143530|283;[Van De Poel, Ibo]|[ur.012054402012.89]|Technology Analysis and Strategic Management|2000|12|3|383-397|10.1080/09537320050130615|pub.1025017100|95;[Genus, Audley; Nor, Mohd AliMohamad]|[ur.07530664425.38; ur.014051017777.31]|Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations|2005|3|2|82-94|10.4018/jeco.2005040106|pub.1025883303|15;[Geels, Frank W.]|[ur.0615616770.33]|Research Policy|2004|33|6-7|897-920|10.1016/j.respol.2004.01.015|pub.1028934663|2023;[Geels, F.W.]|[ur.0615616770.33]|Technological Forecasting and Social Change|2005|72|6|681-696|10.1016/j.techfore.2004.08.014|pub.1030835700|531;[Raven, R.P.J.M.]|[ur.0651162727.65]|Energy Policy|2004|32|1|29-39|10.1016/s0301-4215(02)00248-3|pub.1034088492|44;[Ritchie, Bryan K.]|[ur.011476254565.83]|World Development|2005|33|5|745-761|10.1016/j.worlddev.2005.01.006|pub.1039574663|20;[Geels, Frank W.]|[ur.0615616770.33]|Research Policy|2002|31|8-9|1257-1274|10.1016/s0048-7333(02)00062-8|pub.1042120609|3355;[Geels, F.W.]|[ur.0615616770.33]|Technovation|2006|26|9|999-1016|10.1016/j.technovation.2005.08.010|pub.1047252053|122;[Raven, Rob; Verbong, Geert]|[ur.0651162727.65; ur.013315534021.76]|Innovation|2004|6|2|178-198|10.5172/impp.2004.6.2.178|pub.1051720548|17;[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.011256716263.36; ur.015022300133.21]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|1|9-19|10.1080/02683960210132061|pub.1058311977|118;[Loch, Karen D.; Straub, Detmar W.; Kamel, Sherif]|[ur.013651545512.31; ur.012470601004.22; ur.012110175232.97]|IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management|2003|50|1|45-63|10.1109/tem.2002.808257|pub.1061600071|196;[Smith, Ronel]|[]|First Monday|2000|5|10||10.5210/fm.v5i10.793|pub.1072710521|2;[Belz, Frank-Martin]|[ur.011045137501.26]|System Innovation and the Transition to Sustainability|2004||||10.4337/9781845423421.00016|pub.1087778891|23"
pub.1028643785,10.1016/j.compedu.2003.08.006,Crossing the digital divide safely and trustingly: how ecologies of learning scaffold the journey,"The article addresses the issue of learning to elearn in borderless programs in a globalised learning landscape and the associated problems of scaffolding the journey across the digital divide. The authors argue that the assumption underlying such courses is that cross-cultural programs are viable because they are conceived and designed to be ‘global’, and that they assume this design to be inclusive. Henning and Van der Westhuizen claim that the global discourse in most domains can take only marginal note of the need to infuse such programs with a local semiotic—a course design criterion for which they argue. They furthermore forward the notion that the majority of the world's prospective elearners need various bridging mechanisms in order to be able to access the broader discourse and that one of these mechanisms can be explored through the metaphor of “information ecologies” as proposed by Nardi and O'Day [Nardi, B.A., & O'Day, V.L. (1999). Information ecologies. Using technology with heart. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press]. They also conclude that issues of the learners’ trust in the course and its system need to be considered when contemplating programs for diverse target groups. By way of a case study, consisting of three portraitures of adult learners, they explore the limitations of assumed distributed cognition and claim that learning is, in reality, contained/constrained in the familiar local narrative of the novice adult elearners in a rural South African context. The case study illustrates how the resistance to technology and its power base becomes an obstacle for the students and how the support of peers becomes the main scaffolding mechanism for their entry into electronic learning environments. The findings thus show how the social context becomes the facilitator and the scaffold for elearning, more than technology and the curriculum itself.",Computers & Education,2004,42,4,333-352,"Henning, Elizabeth; Van der Westhuizen, Duan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028643785,15,"[Barab, Sasha A.; The ILF Design Team; Makinster, James G.; Moore, Julie A.; Cunningham, Donald J.]|[ur.01241475660.83; ; ur.0621624070.49; ; ur.0764246102.18]|Educational technology research and development|2001|49|4|71-96|10.1007/bf02504948|pub.1006325008|121;[Brown, John Seely; Collins, Allan; Duguid, Paul]|[ur.014430365055.10; ur.014012165741.82; ur.015536176017.71]|Educational Researcher|1989|18|1|32-42|10.3102/0013189x018001032|pub.1010595714|7474;[DUFF, PATRICIA A.; BELL, JILL SINCLAIR]|[ur.015352616625.07; ur.016557536753.82]|TESOL Quarterly|2002|36|2|207-213|10.2307/3588331|pub.1014982199|228;[PAVLENKO, ANETA]|[ur.012112315517.94]|TESOL Quarterly|2002|36|2|213-218|10.2307/3588332|pub.1017991779|105;[Henze, Rosemary C.; Glesne, Corrine; Peshkin, Alan; Berg, Bruce L.; Hammersley, Martyn; Atkinson, Paul]|[ur.010345207766.61; ur.011505700717.93; ; ; ; ]|TESOL Quarterly|1995|29|3|595-599|10.2307/3588079|pub.1019740199|569;[Giri, Ananta Kumar]|[ur.013374363167.17]|Futures|2002|34|1|103-115|10.1016/s0016-3287(01)00038-6|pub.1022553778|70;[Cottle, Thomas J.]|[ur.016036540366.54]|Qualitative Inquiry|2002|8|5|535-549|10.1177/107780002237003|pub.1024605160|15;[Lal, V]|[]|Futures|2002|34|1|1-14|10.1016/s0016-3287(01)00031-3|pub.1026497161|5;[]|[]|Computers & Mathematics with Applications|2003|45|10-11|1774|10.1016/s0898-1221(03)80128-1|pub.1033642258|75;[Resnick, Lauren B .]|[]|Perspectives on socially shared cognition.|1991|||1-20|10.1037/10096-018|pub.1039558333|276;[Oliver, R.; Omari, A.]|[ur.010137672217.40; ]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2001|17|1|34-47|10.1111/j.1365-2729.2001.00157.x|pub.1042496375|59;[Henderson, Mae]|[]||1994||||10.4324/9781315865911|pub.1046761842|8;[Oliver, R.; Omari, A.]|[; ]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2001|17|1|34-47|10.1046/j.1365-2729.2001.00157.x|pub.1056736505|58;[Seely, Brown; Seely Brown, John; Duguid, Paul]|[; ur.010413705027.36; ur.012006646027.65]|Work Study|2000|49|4||10.1108/ws.2000.07949dae.002|pub.1061082758|52;[Ellul, Jacques]|[]|Technology and Culture|1962|3|4|394|10.2307/3100993|pub.1070196918|338;[Bevington, Gary; Wolcott, Harry F.]|[; ur.013666247603.07]|Modern Language Journal|1996|80|3|405|10.2307/329455|pub.1070258749|244;[Nardi, Bonnie; O'Day, Vicki]|[ur.012361270012.98; ur.013342517701.95]|First Monday|1999|4|5||10.5210/fm.v4i5.669|pub.1072710489|122;[]|[]|Choice|1990|28|01|28-0612-28-0612|10.5860/choice.28-0612|pub.1073299619|1829;[]|[]|Choice|1991|28|11|28-6498-28-6498|10.5860/choice.28-6498|pub.1073305543|1379;[]|[]|Choice|1991|29|03|29-1793-29-1793|10.5860/choice.29-1793|pub.1073307389|49;[]|[]|Choice|1992|30|02|30-0885-30-0885|10.5860/choice.30-0885|pub.1073313114|144;[]|[]|Choice|1996|33|10|33-5756-33-5756|10.5860/choice.33-5756|pub.1073337521|268;[]|[]|Choice|1999|36|11|36-6416-36-6416|10.5860/choice.36-6416|pub.1073358761|174;[]|[]|Choice|2001|38|05|38-2855-38-2855|10.5860/choice.38-2855|pub.1073369704|65;[Riessman, Catherine Kohler]|[ur.0723015623.08]|Handbook of Interview Research|2001|||695-710|10.4135/9781412973588.n40|pub.1088079103|319;[Wengraf, Tom]|[]||2001||||10.4135/9781849209717|pub.1095899287|1239;[Phillips, Nelson; Hardy, Cynthia]|[; ]||2002||||10.4135/9781412983921|pub.1095899999|1088;[Lave, Jean; Wenger, Etienne]|[; ]||1991||||10.1017/cbo9780511815355|pub.1098698749|28437;[Lave, Jean]|[]||1988||||10.1017/cbo9780511609268|pub.1098708932|3567;[Chaiklin, Seth; Lave, Jean]|[]|Understanding Practice|1993||||10.1017/cbo9780511625510|pub.1109384170|376;[]|[]|Leonardo's Laptop|2003||||10.7551/mitpress/4201.001.0001|pub.1110620704|80;[Bruner, Jerome]|[]||1997||||10.2307/j.ctv136c601|pub.1128821421|312"

However, recent work indicates that this is not a straightforward divide about access; instead there are many variants of access, use, and presence online. This paper examines these variants, bringing together primarily US and European studies on the digital divide to identify social facilitators and inhibitors to online use that can inform policy and practice. This paper reviews research on who is and is not online, where access is gained, and what promotes or inhibits use of the Internet. This leads to identification of a number of interrelated social and technical factors that underlie access differences, including technical and social infrastructures, social networks, and content.",2007 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'07),2007,,,1-10,"Haythornthwaite, Caroline",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095235401,11,"[Gaver, Bill; Dunne, Tony; Pacenti, Elena]|[ur.011044424147.10; ; ur.014032326147.24]|Interactions|1999|6|1|21-29|10.1145/291224.291235|pub.1007470426|1286;[Rubin Patterson, Ernest J.

UK legislation advocates universal access and equitable provision of services, across all platforms and equipment, particularly for ‘vulnerable’ groups. However, key aspects of usability and accessibility have been overlooked by those responsible for encouraging this new infrastructure’s inclusive development. Aspects of previous interactive television provision and developments in web accessibility appear to have been ignored, along with findings from relevant user-centred research and even from specifically commissioned reports.

Our approach is to calculate several different cost-of-equity values and then use simulation techniques to build up a probability distribution for each company’s cost of equity. In this way, a clearer picture of where a company’s cost of equity lies is developed. Closing the Digital Divide could bring many benefits to developing countries but international investors and development planners must be able to make their own cost-of-equity calculations so that they can see first hand how their investment projects compare with other investment projects around the globe.",Digital Economy,2005,,,39-61,"Kehal, Harbhajan; Singh, Varinder; Henriques, Irene; Sadorsky, Perry",York University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021743894,0,

Since economic strategy is predicated on the nation's economic objective and policy environments, sustainable and equitable economic development is regarded as the key objective. Major trends are identified in the policy environment, including the emerging globalization and information era, demographic changes, declining savings and investment rates, and a widening digital divide. In light of these trends, the Korean government should play a complementary role to the private sector, providing a robust infrastructure to safeguard the private sector's development and to attract mobile resources from abroad.

While successful development of 3G services will depend on the private sector, it will also be crucially influenced by the policy and regulatory environment, in particular by the facilitation of market entry through appropriate licensing policies, as well as post‐entry competitive conditions. This article reports on the findings of a workshop organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) which identified critical policy issues with respect to the deployment of 3G mobile, including the regulatory status of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and the facilitation of global roaming. The potential role ITU could play as a facilitator of harmonized approaches for the global mobile information society is also explored.",Info,2002,4,1,48-55,"Goodrick, Joanna; Srivastava, Lara",International Telecommunication Union,Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022191103,0,

To help to explain differences in the intensity of use of new technologies across countries, this chapter also relies on indicators of barriers to the use of information technology. Answers on perceived barriers and on their evaluation are inevitably qualitative in nature and need to be used with caution in international comparisons. Nevertheless, they can be of great interest to policy makers. For example, indicators of barriers can help for monitoring issues of digital divide, point to potential bottlenecks related to the technology or lack of appropriate skills and help address concerns about security and logistics.",Measuring the Information Economy 2002,2003,,,37-57,OECD,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1088391754,0,

Norway has succeeded in providing a legal framework for e-government by reviewing and amending laws and regulations which impeded e-government and ensured privacy protection. Lack of funds and long term and joint funding mechanisms have been identified as the biggest budgetary barriers. However, in light of the existing flexibility within the Norwegian budgetary mechanisms, the problem does not seem to be the lack of budget mechanisms but rather lack of collaboration and inexperience with using business cases and other budgetary justification within ministries.

pub.1001908959,10.1002/nem.466,Toward the development of a standard e‐readiness assessment policy,"Information networking for digital integration is becoming of increasing importance for national and international organizations concerned with development. E‐Readiness assessments, for various countries, are associated with the investigation of their state of readiness for such integration. They help in understanding the problems that need to be resolved in order to avoid digital divide, or even digital isolation, from world development. Such assessments lack standard policies, which provide unified measures that ease evaluations, support analysis and comparisons, and help in diagnosing problems and deriving solutions. This paper is concerned with the development of a standard e‐readiness assessment policy. It provides a base for the development of such a policy, and hopes that this base will contribute to a future standard international policy.

Indeed, as a strategy for helping developing countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), resources have been put aside to promote ICT. In 2002 the CEO Charter for Digital Development committed its signatories to give 20% of their annual corporate philanthropy budget to ICT projects in developing countries (United Nations 2002). In March 2005, the United Nations after years of deliberations launched a ‘Digital Solidarity Fund’ to finance projects that address ‘the uneven distribution and use’ of ICT and are aimed at enabling excluded people and countries to enter the new era of the information society (Economist 2005a).",Corporate Citizenship in Africa: Lessons from the Past; Paths to the Future,2006,,,201-210,"Muthuri, Judy N.; Mwaura, Kiarie",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047395581,2,

The internet, with its huge quantities and variety of content, is increasingly becoming an effective delivery and exchange system for information and knowledge, continuing education and learning. However, rural ICT requires special efforts to create appropriate models for those who can neither afford the Internet access nor have the language capacity to understand the content.[1] New information and communication technologies represent perhaps the greatest tool to date for self‐education and value‐addition to an individual or community's own efforts for development, yet poor rural communities do not have the necessary awareness, skills or facilities to contribute to their own development using ICTs. The majority and those with the least resources in South Asia are being left out of the benefits of these new technologies and more importantly, rural areas do even have a foothold in the revolution that ICTs are ushering in. Parallel to other increasing forms of inequity, there is an evident gap, widening at an exponential rate, between those with access to media and ICTs as productive tools and those without. Closing what has become known as ‘the digital divide’ is particularly important precisely because digital ICTs cut across and add value to all fields of development and offer applications to bridge the spectrum of inequities of which the ‘digital divide’ is only an extension or a symptom. The communication scenario along with the political context in the island nation of Sri Lanka is very much similar to most its South Asian neighbours. The metropolis and regional centres are witnessing rapid expansions in telecom and media sectors while telephones, electricity and clean drinking water are luxuries for many in the countryside.

pub.1034524774,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch122,ICT Usage in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Given the circumstances of women’s lives in sub-Saharan Africa, it may appear that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are only for wealthy, well-educated, urbanized women with time to use them, and that they are irrelevant for other women in sub-Saharan Africa. However, this is not the case: women see ICTs as providing opportunities for change, by giving them access to the information which will help improve their circumstances, as the abundant research shows (Hafkin & Taggart, 2001; Huyer & Mitter, 2003; Morna & Khan, 2000; Pacific Institute of Women’s Health [PIWH], 2002; Rathgeber & Adera, 2000). This article presents an overview of women as ICT users in sub-Saharan Africa, covering the challenges and the success stories. Since there is a large body of literature covering this area, only a representative subset is surveyed. The focus here is usage. Information technology (IT) professionals and more technological topics are considered elsewhere in this volume. Much of the literature about usage in developing countries takes a broad definition of ICTs because of the lack of the latest technologies. For example, Holmes (2004) includes computers, the Internet, mobile phones and wireless technologies as well as telephone, radio, television, print media, listening groups, and community theatre. This article will consider all electronic technologies, from computers and networking to radio and television. When considering ICTs and developing countries, the digital divide is often mentioned. This term is sometimes used specifically to refer to the Internet; for example, see DiMaggio, Hargittai, Neuman, and Robinson (2001). In line with the broad definition of ICTs given above, in this article, the term digital divide will be used to refer to inequality in access to ICTs and ability to use them. There are multiple divides: men vs. women, urban vs. rural, rich vs. poor, young vs. old, developed vs. developing. When considering developing countries, there is an underlying information divide—people do not have access to information sources they require, electronic or otherwise, due to poverty and lack of infrastructure. This is the real problem that needs to be solved—ICTs are a means to this end.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,786-792,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Galpin, Vashti",University of the Witwatersrand,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034524774,0,
pub.1003423499,10.1108/03074800610677308,Who says that old dogs cannot learn new tricks?,"In our modern society there is a prevailing belief that computers and the internet are mainly used by younger generations, who grew up with modern technology, and are generally all information literate. However, research shows that through the past ten years more and more older people have started to learn how to use computers and, of course, how to use the internet. The aim of this paper is to investigate and analyse internet usage among seniors on the basis of a case study showing the actual situation in Slovenia. A survey was carried out among seniors, the participants of different Third Age University programmes, by using a questionnaire, designed for this study. This particular group of seniors was chosen because they lead more active lifestyle than average seniors and the results should be more relevant. Participating in these programmes means they are eager to learn new things and that they have access to computers. It was found that among the seniors, Third Age University participants, only one third were active internet users. It was less than expected, as Slovenia has quite high internet usage among its citizens. Education and partly age were important factors in defining internet use. Public libraries can play a particularly important role in offering information literacy courses, offering space and others services to them, but this was not confirmed by the results of this study. The paper tried to establish the situation with a case study in Slovenia, a new EU member but also one of the European countries with the greatest use of internet and web. Digital divide, differences along the criteria of age, might be more important than elsewhere. Use of internet and web will become more and more wide‐spread and problems with social groups left out will be more visible and will have negative implications on equality of all citizens. Seniors as a social group are especially vulnerable and need help. Libraries can and must find new services with initiatives that promote the reduction of digital divide among age groups.",New Library World,2006,107,7/8,332-345,"Juznic, Primoz; Blazic, Maja; Mercun, Tanja; Plestenjak, Barbara; Majcenovic, Darko",University of Ljubljana; National and University Library of Slovenia,Slovenia; Slovenia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003423499,25,"[Bawden, David]|[]|Journal of Documentation|2001|57|2|218-259|10.1108/eum0000000007083|pub.1000197126|464;[Klobas, Jane E.; Clyde, Laurel A.]|[ur.015472574537.43; ur.010233370347.00]|Library Management|2001|22|1/2|61-68|10.1108/01435120110358943|pub.1012207466|17;[Laurich, Rob]|[]|Collection Building|2002|21|4|174-182|10.1108/01604950210447421|pub.1012456234|6;[Wallis, Jake]|[ur.014072277107.36]|Library Review|2005|54|4|218-222|10.1108/00242530510593407|pub.1012752767|25;[Swindell, Richard; Thompson, Jean]|[; ]|Educational Gerontology|1995|21|5|429-447|10.1080/0360127950210505|pub.1031811960|110;[Vuori, Satu; Holmlund‐Rytkönen, Maria]|[; ur.015464466757.17]|Marketing Intelligence & Planning|2005|23|1|58-76|10.1108/02634500510577474|pub.1032451656|51;[Williams, Peter; Nicholas, Dave]|[ur.01233510277.60; ur.013242724300.13]|New Library World|1998|99|4|143-148|10.1108/03074809810217965|pub.1033246462|4;[Meischke, Hendrika; Eisenberg, Mickey; Rowe, Sharon; Cagle, Anthony]|[ur.01150046161.62; ur.014210767342.55; ur.01250731416.40; ur.01317044616.55]|Heart & Lung|2005|34|1|3-12|10.1016/j.hrtlng.2004.06.006|pub.1037902247|28;[Karavidas, Maria; Lim, Nicholas K.; Katsikas, Steve L.]|[; ; ]|Computers in Human Behavior|2005|21|5|697-711|10.1016/j.chb.2004.03.012|pub.1039989426|171;[Hubregtse, Sjaak]|[]|New Library World|2005|106|3/4|164-172|10.1108/03074800510587363|pub.1053626666|13;[Millward, Peter]|[ur.010411317705.13]|First Monday|2003|8|7||10.5210/fm.v8i7.1066|pub.1072710859|97"

It is said that the growing digital divide has added one more dimension to the already skewed process of development-underdevelopment (Castells, 2000). In reality however it has more to do with the deprivation of information and knowledge than the non-availability of hardware and connectivity. To overcome this, it is necessary to look from a fresh perspective and introduce a new socio-organizational model that builds on the principles of Information Society (Castells, 2000), Economics of Knowledge (Machlup, 1962; Arthur, 1985; Romer, 1990) and Social Capital (Coleman, 1988; Putnam, 1995) to ensure better development of human and social capital.",Encyclopedia of Developing Regional Communities with Information and Communication Technology,2005,,,528-532,"Marshall, Stewart; Taylor, Wal; Yu, Xinghuo; Shaligram, Anil",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1033132172,0,

The solutions must be affordable. Some of the major challenges in developing local solutions based on ICT are Bridging the Digital Divide, Trustworthiness, Protecting Intellectual Property, Information Assurance, Privacy, Hacking , Viruses and Worms. The solutions for these challenges are ‘People-Centric’ and are thus influenced by the “personal” and “professional” ethics of individuals. All the challenges cited above lead to many ethical issues. Internet being a global phenomenon the ethical issues need to be examined in Intercultural perspective.

Our particular focus is on the opportunities e-commerce offers to small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries and the challenges they face in exploiting e-commerce’s potential.There is a risk that a “digital divide” will emerge, reinforcing existing income and wealth inequalities within and between countries.

The goal of this research is to examine the role of modernization (i.e., structural conduciveness) in the form of income, telephone price and structure, education, and political structures, and global contact in the form of world cities, trade, investment, activities of international nongovernmental organizations, and short‐term exchanges of population in driving the worldwide diffusion of the Internet. Methods. We use longitudinal regression analyses (1995–2000) of change in Internet hosts for approximately 80 developing countries. Results. The analyses suggest that foreign investment, major urban agglomerations, manufacturing exports, nongovernmental organization presence, and tourism as well as democratic openness, property rights, and income predict Internet diffusion during the time period under investigation.

We ask, to what extent can people in poor urban communities, once trained, be expected to volunteer to work on furthering community education and development in ICTs in their local area? Findings indicate four patterns of individual engagement with the computer project: reflexive, utilitarian, distributive, and nonparticipatory.

Cross-sectional data from the European Social Survey database were utilized and an ordered probit model with selectivity was employed. The hypothesized link between the decision to use the Internet and the extent of usage was confirmed by the data. Household income, cost of access, demographics, media use, regional characteristics and general skill acquisition by individuals appear to correlate with Internet use and the extent of usage. In addition, a non-linear decomposition analysis was applied in order to identify the causes of the observed south/north divide. The results indicate that the observed differences in the probability of Internet use constitute a structural problem.",Economics of Innovation and New Technology,2006,15,3,235-246,"Demoussis, Michael; Giannakopoulos, Nicholas",University of Patras,Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027130931,71,"[Madden, Gary; Coble–Neal, Grant]|[ur.011425771741.73; ur.014775325515.94]|Economic Record|2002|78|242|343-357|10.1111/1475-4932.00062|pub.1001838930|8;[Kelly, Ross E.; Lewis, Philip E.

Connectivity is one aspect of the divide, albeit an important one. Availability and affordability remain important issues, but these depend on not only technology choices, but also business and regulatory models. While mobile phones have achieved spectacular growth in emerging regions, Internet access, especially broadband, lags far behind. A generalized model of costing broadband indicates that limited uplinking (interconnection) is a significant barrier to widespread and affordable connectivity, but last mile access also remains a challenge. In addition, policy distortions and regulations raise costs dramatically. Because of these, new technologies, business models, and regulations may be required to make connectivity available and affordable in emerging economies.

Barriers to the adoption of e‐business technologies and techniques are discussed, together with factors that promote successful adoption, and the major role played by human capital.

Work is becoming more flexible, but also more precarious and more polarized socially.

Use of geographic information systems on the Cato Manor Development project, South Africa","The focus on the digital divide raises important questions with regards to the global impact of information technology. Technical inequalities are, however, often embedded in the development project where access to technological knowledge becomes a determining factor in the development process. This paper aims to uncover the use of geographic information systems (GIS) on the Cato Manor Development Project in Durban, South Africa. The focus will be on an instant where the legitimacy of the project was challenged by former residents, removed from the area during the Apartheid era, and the role of information technology in resolving that conflict. The paper will show that GIS is not necessarily a value-free tool, but can influence development decisions contrary to the expectations of those affected by it.

Three main categories of social and ethical issues arise in connection with IPv6: issues relating to the right to an IP address, issues related to the application of the technology, and issues related to governance. There are many societal benefits of IPv6, as it will enable once more to have end-to-end security of transmission. Nevertheless, the governance of this deployment now and in the coming years needs to be neutral and controlled, and the governance of the IPv6 Internet that emerges after deployment must be transparent and accountable.

HCI theory has evolved in urban environments over the past 30 years and may not be suitable for the village environment. However, Activity Theory lends itself well to these environments as its primary focus is on pre-existing activities and goals rather than digital artifacts themselves.

Despite concerns such as the issue of information imperialism, Indigenous Australians have recognised the empowering potential of the Internet as an information resource, communication tool, and publishing medium.

Of some 902 nonprofit organizations in the religious and charitable category, 90% used the Internet for email and Web access. Additionally, 66.7% had Web sites. OLS regression and bivariate correlational analysis suggests that organizations with larger fund balances, greater budget percentages attributed to ICT, and a history of early adoption are statistically significantly more likely to have greater bandwidth connectivity to the Internet. In contrast, organizations with greater free cash flow are statistically significantly less likely to have greater bandwidth, although organization size does not correlate significantly with bandwidth connectivity.",Trends in Communication,2003,11,1,81-94,"Zimmer, Eric A.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028232558,4,

pub.1043510313,10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.004,Closing the rural broadband gap: Promoting adoption of the Internet in rural America,"Even as geographic disparities in high speed Internet access narrow, an urban–rural broadband gap persists, pointing to the importance of individual differences in motivations to adopt broadband as the key to closing the gap. Diffusion of innovation is reconceptualized through contemporary perspectives of the digital divide and social cognitive theory and tested on a survey sample drawn from four rural communities. Path analysis was used to examine the factors that cause broadband Internet service adoption in rural communities.

However, with the global growth of information and communications technologies (ICT) and digital divide interventions, women are enrolling in university programs which prepare them for employment in the formal workforce. In this paper, we present a study in which we interviewed 32 women enrolled in an ICT program at a Kenyan university. The interviews examined the women's responses to the program as well as the women's experiences in seeking and securing ICT-related employment. Our findings indicate that women were highly optimistic, embracing ICT as a practical mechanism for achieving entrée into the labor force and empowering women. However they perceive significant structural barriers, such as gender discrimination in hiring practices, organization's inability to recognize their mix of technical and business competencies, and national ICT policies which did not support the growth in the technology sector.","Proceedings of the 2006 ACM SIGMIS CPR conference on computer personnel research Forty four years of computer personnel research: achievements, challenges & the future - SIGMIS CPR '06",2006,,,114-119,"Kvasny, Lynette; Payton, Fay Cobb; Chong, Jing; Mbarika, Victor",Pennsylvania State University; North Carolina State University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College,United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030744309,3,"[Kvasny, Lynette]|[ur.012613150205.25]|ACM SIGMIS Database the DATABASE for Advances in Information Systems|2006|37|4|13-25|10.1145/1185335.1185342|pub.1004610507|36;[Payton, Fay Cobb]|[ur.07604463107.21]|Communications of the ACM|2003|46|6|89-91|10.1145/777313.777318|pub.1026378124|27;[Liu, Jonathan; Wilson, Doirean]|[ur.013461556227.85; ur.010675307427.20]|Gender in Management An International Journal|2001|16|8|405-416|10.1108/09649420110411701|pub.1035653266|21;[Sahay, Sundeep; Avgerou, Chrisanthi]|[; ur.012304503075.13]|The Information Society|2002|18|2|73-76|10.1080/01972240290075002|pub.1038696774|58;[HERRING, SUSAN]|[]|The Information Society|1996|12|2|153-168|10.1080/911232343|pub.1040563221|81"

The diffusion pattern of an innovation such as the Internet is a function of economic, political, cultural, and geographical factors. In addition, business models vis‐à‐vis the cost to access the Internet also influence the diffusion of the Internet. Because social systems worldwide differ significantly in terms of these factors, diffusion patterns of the Internet also vary widely. Among the factors hampering the faster diffusion of Internet in many countries are low income levels, authoritarian governments with a distaste for the openness of the Internet, sociocultural environments that are incompatible with the Internet, and terrestrial and topographical barriers to landline networks. As a result, developing countries account for disproportionately fewer Internet users and Internet hosts worldwide, creating a global digital divide.",The Internet Encyclopedia,2004,,,,"Dholakia, Nikhilesh; Dholakia, Ruby Roy; Kshetri, Nir",University of Rhode Island; University of North Carolina System,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1089836615,7,"[Zaheer, Srilata; Zaheer, Akbar]|[ur.013112516725.18; ur.015303040325.36]|Journal of International Business Studies|1997|28|1|77-100|10.1057/palgrave.jibs.8490094|pub.1003820878|80;[Church, James A.]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|2001|28|3|348-351|10.1016/s1352-0237(01)00307-0|pub.1003959636|184;[Shadrach, B.]|[]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|28|2|23-27|10.1002/bult.232|pub.1025360689|5;[Javalgi, Rajshekhar; Ramsey, Rosemary]|[ur.010443012351.00; ur.016640331063.34]|International Marketing Review|2001|18|4|376-391|10.1108/02651330110398387|pub.1039365296|79;[Cassiolato, Jose E.; Baptista, Margarida A.C.]|[ur.016233365213.32; ur.011123255013.14]|Information Technology for Development|1996|7|2|53-73|10.1080/02681102.1996.9525270|pub.1041280074|7;[Erben, Michael]|[ur.012571704345.74]|Sociology|1993|27|1|15-25|10.1177/003803859302700103|pub.1042761995|28;[Hahn, Saul]|[]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|25|5|15-17|10.1002/bult.126|pub.1048077583|5;[Bell, Hudson; Tang, Nelson K.H.]|[; ur.015361170624.56]|Internet Research|1998|8|3|219-228|10.1108/10662249810217768|pub.1048576885|110;[Takacs, Scott J.; Freiden, Jon B.]|[ur.012140163247.22; ur.015122017035.54]|The Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice|1998|6|3|24-37|10.1080/10696679.1998.11501802|pub.1052229745|20;[Kshetri, Nir B.]|[ur.010126432036.35]|Electronic Markets|2001|11|4|250-257|10.1080/101967801753405535|pub.1058356304|33;[Kshetri, Nir; Dholakia, Nikhilesh]|[ur.010126432036.35; ur.013327347110.55]|Electronic Markets|2002|12|2|120-129|10.1080/10196780252844562|pub.1058356325|36;[Gatignon, Hubert; Robertson, Thomas S.]|[; ]|Journal of Consumer Research|1985|11|4|849|10.1086/209021|pub.1058528608|840;[Andrews, Debby]|[]|Business Communication Quarterly|2002|65|1|7-8|10.1177/108056990206500101|pub.1063968516|1;[Putnam, D.

Accelerated change in the introduction of ICT-enabled solutions can potentially transform all aspects of society, work, business and government. E-technologies and ICT-enabled solutions bring about new forms of governance in the public sector. It is evident that the Internet and Web-based technologies have both had a profound effect on the ways in which the public sector functions.

It addresses differing views and perceptions of the implications of digital government; elaborates on the ‘digital divide’ and its impact on the success of digital government; and outlines the results of a preliminary study of the effectiveness of a digital local government initiative.",Public Management Review,2005,7,3,465-487,"Asgarkhani, Mehdi",Ara Institute of Canterbury,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036923313,68,"[Wescott, Clay G.]|[ur.010203276471.90]|Asian Journal of Political Science|2001|9|2|1-24|10.1080/02185370108434189|pub.1010035376|125;[Tapscott, Don]|[]|Canadian Public Administration|1997|40|2|328-345|10.1111/j.1754-7121.1997.tb01513.x|pub.1014584053|8;[]|[]||2002||||10.4324/9780203204962|pub.1018877449|287;[Reschenthaler, G.B.; Thompson, F.]|[ur.016342163567.88; ur.07637112367.83]|Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory|1996|6|1|125-143|10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a024296|pub.1059962444|44;[Raab, Charles D]|[]|The Governance of Cyberspace|1997||||10.4324/9780203360408_chapter_10|pub.1087802738|12;[Massetti, Brenda]|[]|MIS Quarterly|1996|20|1|83|10.2307/249543|pub.1102515005|153"

The “remote line” issue is especially important because these lines were classified on the other side of the digital divide as the “have nots” of the high-speed Internet age. As this article demonstrates, the “capability” prediction was accurate, but rapid technological breakthroughs have reduced the cost of upgrading remote lines considerably.

Implemented in rural Maharashtra, Warana Unwired sought to replace an existing PC-based system for managing information in a sugarcane cooperative with an SMS-based mobile-phone system. In an eight-month trial involving seven villages, Warana Unwired successfully replicated all of the PC-based functionality, and was found to be less expensive, more convenient, and more popular with farmers than the previous PC-based system. This paper discusses the early investigations of the Warana Wired Village Project that led to the conception and implementation of the Warana Unwired project.

A conceptual cost-benefit framework is developed to comprehensively assess the costs and benefits categories associated with electronic government projects, and to compare it against the politically biased analysis. CBA depends largely upon analysts' view on the costs and benefits of a project. Most electronic government projects are analyzed by the politicians' view, which can depart from the normative assumptions of standard CBA to reflect the viewpoints of affected key constituencies. This biased view tends to inflate benefits and to underestimate costs by ignoring major costs.

Unlike in enterprise environments, however, householders often do not plan or manage for network growth. As a result, devices are often added in a haphazard, piecemeal manner [1]. The open-ended nature of home networking protocols has also led to highly dynamic and heterogeneous home networks. The range of possible devices and possible ways to configure and connect those devices—means that every network likely looks different; one study suggests that highly customized, end-user configured home networks are the norm in many households today [2]. Given the complexity of digital devices, the presence of highly-customized networks, and the technical inexperience of many people, how well do householders understand the structure and function of their home networks?

Its scope covers every election or decision-making process, which takes place through voting. Due mainly to the digital divide and to current technological limitation, electronic voting cannot be proposed as a universal means of voting but rather as an alternative option, supplemental to traditional voting means. An electronic voting process must be designed in such a way as to guarantee the general, free, equal and secret character of elections. In a democratic context an electronic voting system should respect and ensure attributes and properties such as transparency, verifiability, accountability, security and accuracy. Only then can it foster and promote the participation of the citizens, the legitimacy and the democratic transaction of the election process.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2002,86,,469-480,"Mitrou, Lilian; Gritzalis, Dimitris; Katsikas, Sokratis",University of the Aegean; Athens University of Economics and Business,Greece; Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038157299,39,"[Mercuri, Rebecca]|[ur.016470074133.75]|Communications of the ACM|2000|43|11|176|10.1145/353360.353378|pub.1010501377|5;[Hoffman, Lance J.; Cranor, Lorrie]|[ur.01143473600.97; ur.012313770727.30]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|69-71|10.1145/357489.357510|pub.1036708056|15;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28;[Butler, R.; Welch, V.; Engert, D.; Foster, I.; Tuecke, S.; Volmer, J.; Kesselman, C.]|[ur.0635530224.37; ur.016532216777.55; ; ur.0634177304.42; ur.014051011760.45; ; ur.01022504670.00]|Computer|2000|33|12|60-66|10.1109/2.889094|pub.1061106331|186"

However, the “digital divide” is increasing rather than diminishing existing inequalities. This paper suggests several ways in which experiences with ICTs can be shared and in which more resources could be mobilised to support local ICT projects and locally‐defined goals. The activities of the Commonwealth’s agencies in this area are used to provide illustrations of a variety of initiatives. It is argued that strategic action on the part of agencies within their own organisations and in co‐operation with others is likely to help to facilitate the process of constructing a stronger knowledge base for knowledge‐driven development, but that there is no room for complacency. In addition to improved co‐ordination and co‐operation, effort is needed to focus on the purposes and goals of knowledge‐driven development, rather than on the short‐term interests of individual stakeholder organisations.",Journal of Knowledge Management,2002,6,4,317-329,"Mansell, Robin",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027872970,31,"[UNDP]|[]|Human Development Report|1999|||57-76|10.18356/7c56eb17-en|pub.1090069694|5;[Mansell, Robin]|[]||2002||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198296553.001.0001|pub.1098732077|47;[Heeks, Richard]|[ur.01241047651.15]|SSRN Electronic Journal|1998||||10.2139/ssrn.3540073|pub.1125711327|15"

CzRM promises higher service quality at lower costs. CzRM was originally a private sector business strategy, part of the “entrepreneurial” paradigm that was applied to the public sector in the mid-1990s. This paper deals with four concerns: the assertion that transformation of citizens into customers has damaging effects on democratic governance and public administration; the existence of digital divides; accountability-issues; and the role of consultants as intermediaries. Finally, the change in citizens’ wants and views about government may be caused by more fundamental changes happening in the American society. Despite the mentioned concerns, CzRM is feasible, but it should occur with an awareness of the raison d’être of the public sector, and that government has a role in securing both the quality and equality of government services.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2005,3591,,57-68,"Larsen, Bettina; Milakovich, Michael",University of Miami,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1021213221,16,"[Grönlund, Tuulikki; Kauppila, Tommi]|[ur.014407001715.80; ur.012253644401.28]|Boreas|2002|31|3|273-284|10.1080/030094802760260382|pub.1058316241|7;[]|[]|GSA Today|2004|14|4|12|10.1130/1052-5173(2004)014<0012:natgb>2.0.co;2|pub.1062732412|1;[HOLDEN, STEPHEN H.; NORRIS, DONALD F.; FLETCHER, PATRICIA D.]|[; ; ]|Public Performance & Management Review|2003|26|4|325-344|10.1177/1530957603026004002|pub.1064035451|197"

Hence, there is a great need for providing applications and interfaces in one's own language to tap into this vast knowledge reserve. In addition, access to the Internet is still a major problem in developing countries because of the “digital divide” and hand held devices such as PDAs and Mobile Phones are seen as enablers in bridging this gap. However, displaying cross-lingual content on these mobile devices is a non trivial task and there is a great need for robust mechanisms and infrastructure for content delivery in different languages on the fly. This paper presents an overall approach for cross-lingual content specification and delivery for computing/mobile devices.

We combined data about website visitors through log-file analysis with data about web-hosts and links obtained from a crawler. Results suggest that language may represent a double barrier: first, the number of native speakers determines the number of web-hosts, and hence the amount of information and the interconnectedness of information sources. Second, to access information on a particular website the languages offered are an even more important factor than network effects: non-native speakers and links from websites in other languages are always underrepresented. Our results are in line with the Information Foraging Theory, the Revised Hierarchy Model, network and market theories, and emphasize the role of language on the Internet. Insight into these processes is helpful when website translation represents important investment decisions, or when aiming to diminish the digital divide.",Proceedings of the 39th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS'06),2006,3,,1-10,"Kralisch, Anett; Mandl, Thomas",Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin; University of Hildesheim,Germany; Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095106646,27,"[Pirolli, Peter; Card, Stuart]|[ur.07447117007.63; ur.012405240247.04]|Psychological Review|1999|106|4|643-675|10.1037/0033-295x.106.4.643|pub.1011152620|1155;[Dufour, Robert; Kroll, Judith F.]|[ur.0711763260.54; ur.0715530366.67]|Memory & Cognition|1995|23|2|166-180|10.3758/bf03197219|pub.1014352951|176;[Grin, François]|[]|International Political Science Review|1994|15|1|25-42|10.1177/019251219401500103|pub.1017605986|35;[Martins, Bruno; Silva, Mário J.]|[ur.0712211716.60; ur.015025230201.63]|Proceedings of the 2005 ACM symposium on Applied computing  - SAC '05|2005|||764-768|10.1145/1066677.1066852|pub.1020813548|54;[Tan, Pang-Ning; Kumar, Vipin]|[ur.016500307431.52; ur.0741415521.89]|Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|2002|6|1|9-35|10.1023/a:1013228602957|pub.1024215217|157;[McPherson, Miller; Smith-Lovin, Lynn; Cook, James M]|[ur.011315075142.24; ur.01256604542.52; ]|Annual Review of Sociology|2001|27|1|415-444|10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415|pub.1025450790|10781;[Pirolli, Peter; Card, Stuart]|[ur.07447117007.63; ur.012405240247.04]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI '95|1995|||51-58|10.1145/223904.223911|pub.1026514343|254;[Broder, Andrei; Kumar, Ravi; Maghoul, Farzin; Raghavan, Prabhakar; Rajagopalan, Sridhar; Stata, Raymie; Tomkins, Andrew; Wiener, Janet]|[ur.011161663413.58; ur.012261427377.07; ur.011212540111.93; ur.012437241622.81; ur.012761640703.19; ur.013041317630.43; ur.011254402771.90; ur.014224654557.00]|Computer Networks|2000|33|1-6|309-320|10.1016/s1389-1286(00)00083-9|pub.1042548489|1897;[Hahne, Anja]|[ur.01372173204.52]|Journal of Psycholinguistic Research|2001|30|3|251-266|10.1023/a:1010490917575|pub.1042691911|261;[HALAVAIS, ALEXANDER]|[ur.015340203117.84]|New Media & Society|2000|2|1|7-28|10.1177/14614440022225689|pub.1047943549|131;[Palmer, Jonathan W.; Bailey, Joseph P.; Faraj, Samer]|[; ; ur.01131142316.35]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|5|3|0-0|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2000.tb00342.x|pub.1061923612|163;[Steffensen, Margaret S.; Joag-Dev, Chitra; Anderson, Richard C.]|[; ; ]|Reading Research Quarterly|1979|15|1|10|10.2307/747429|pub.1070667028|252;[Mandl, Thomas]|[ur.010360101212.15]|Information Services & Use|2005|25|2|69-76|10.3233/isu-2005-25201|pub.1091635005|4;[Bharat, Krishna; Chang, Bay-Wei; Henzinger, Monika; Ruhl, Matthias]|[ur.014637462717.53; ur.012776437475.33; ur.011606157736.40; ]|Proceedings 2001 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining|2001|||51-58|10.1109/icdm.2001.989500|pub.1093256466|78;[Baeza-Yates, Ricardo; Poblete, Barbara]|[ur.014235261065.65; ur.010470153555.44]|Proceedings of the IEEE/LEOS 3rd International Conference on Numerical Simulation of Semiconductor Optoelectronic Devices (IEEE Cat.

In order to make broadband access available to these under served areas, several technical solutions are available with the capacity to provide high speed Internet access, video, telephony services, etc. This paper presents a cost-model and a tool for the evaluation of broadband access technologies (xDSL, HFC, FTTx, WiMAX, PLC and satellite), and compares two technologies: FTTx and WiMAX. Our tool compares these different access technologies in different scenarios, and examining the capital expense and deployment of building access networks with the same requisite performance using each technology. The cost model is limited to the access part of the network. The results obtained by our evaluation tool give the possibility to compare several BB access technologies, and support the decision about which is the better technological solution for a given scenario",2007 Second International Conference on Access Networks & Workshops,2007,,,1-8,"Pereira, João Paulo Ribeiro",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094601434,6,"[Weldon, Marcus K.; Zane, Francis]|[ur.014361033247.07; ]|Technical Journal|2003|8|1|181-206|10.1002/bltj.10053|pub.1007905777|28;[Galperin, Hernan]|[ur.010322365021.09]|Information Technologies and International Development|2005|2|3|47-56|10.1162/1544752054782420|pub.1063350551|53;[Pereira, João Paulo Ribeiro; Pires, José Adriano]|[ur.014442260351.39; ur.010144577107.65]|Technological and Economic Development of Economy|2007|13|4|288-294|10.3846/13928619.2007.9637814|pub.1111501362|3"

There are several initiatives to roll out Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in public places in South Africa, but the question arises as to whether people will be able to use it effectively. Is the backlog with regard to general education and training not so insurmountable that people from disadvantaged communities are not educable for computer usage? This paper reports on the experiences and observations of instructors during a word processing training course for people from such communities. An interaction model that incorporates user and interface limitations with the difficulties experienced, serves as framework for the discussion. It became clear that most of the difficulties that attendees experienced were related to lack of technological experience, a limitation that can be eliminated through practice and perseverance. Enough practice might also result in an attenuation of the effects of some psychological limitations.",Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif vir Natuurwetenskap en Tegnologie,2007,26,3,216-238,"Blignaut, Pieter; Dednam, Engela; Beelders, Tanya",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1072234552,0,

It is the oldest form of commerce and continues to have an important role in even the most highly developed societies. Not least it is highly valuable for developing social capital among a community. The Information Society brings to barter both a new meaning for “community” and new mechanisms for exchange. In particular it may be a key motivator for bridging the digital divide, but providing a tangible, understandable purpose for joining the Information Society. The goal of CyberTroc — or Internet-based barter — is to connect people with needs to other capable of satisfying these needs. The Internet is an ideal means for facilitating barter, since it can provide a transactional capability at extremely low cost and since it can bring together communities that may be highly localized or may be very scattered.",IFIP International Federation for Information Processing,2005,161,,244-246,"Harrison, Colin",IBM Research - Zurich,Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042424519,0,

This study therefore aimed to extend knowledge by examining Internet adoption and usage behaviour in a developing country (South Africa). Differences in Internet adoption between those from a group previously advantaged by apartheid and those from a group previously disadvantaged were speciJically examined. For the previously advantaged, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Enjoyment, and Long-term Consequences of Use were found to influence Internet adoption. For the previously disadvantaged, the main influence was Perceived Usefulness, with Perceived Ease of Use having an indirect effect through Perceived Usefulness. DtfSerences in Internet experience and exposure to technology largely explained the observed results as a result of varying socio-economic backgrounds between the majorities in the two groups.

pub.1022170550,10.1002/itdj.1590100203,Can information and communications technology applications contribute to poverty reduction? Lessons from rural India,"Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can reduce poverty by improving poor people's access to education, health, government and financial services. ICT can also help small farmers and artisans by connecting them to markets. It is clear that in rural India -as well as in much of the developing world- realization of this potential is not guaranteed. This paper outlines a simple model to explain why a digital divide may exist between rich and poor. Low-cost access to information infrastructure is a necessary prerequisite for the successful use of ICT by the poor, but it is not sufficient. The implementation of ICT projects needs to be performed by organizations and individuals who have the appropriate incentives to work with marginalized groups. Furthermore, grassroots intermediaries and the involvement of the community are identified as the key factors that foster local ownership and the availability of content and services that respond to the most pressing needs of the poor.",Information Technology for Development,2003,10,2,73-84,"Cecchini, Simone; Scott, Christopher",United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean; London School of Economics and Political Science,Chile; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022170550,213,"[Griffin, Keith]|[ur.07600713203.60]||1979||||10.1007/978-1-349-16176-8|pub.1001036818|89;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Development and Change|2000|31|4|765-783|10.1111/1467-7660.00176|pub.1013954550|13;[Cecchini, Simone; Raina, Monica]|[ur.010657704011.01; ur.014626303323.23]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2002||||10.2139/ssrn.568181|pub.1102205059|19"
pub.1004291194,10.1002/itdj.20071,Digital literacy: Problems faced by telecenter users in Mexico,"This article explores the problems that Internet users of marginalized populations face at telecenters (Internet public access sites). Using an exploratory case study method and gathering data from users and telecenter operators, we have explored users' limitations when using the Internet. To interpret the results, this article uses the digital literacy framework developed by Eshet-Alkai (2004). Findings reveal telecenter users are digitally illiterate in three skills: “branching ability” (ability to navigate through a nonlinear environment to find the desired information); “reproduction ability” (ability to analyze and synthesize the information retrieved); and “information ability” (ability to assess the quality of information). Additionally, there are technical barriers, such as Internet access speed, which influence user's behaviors when searching for information. Finally, the lack of knowledge of the English language, which is the predominant languages in the Internet, is a barrier that widens the digital divide. Based on these findings, this research suggests possible solutions to overcome user's problems. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2007,13,3,217-232,"Huerta, Esperanza; Sandoval-Almazán, Rodrigo",Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México; Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education,Mexico; Mexico,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1004291194,32,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2005|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Barbatsis, Gretchen; Camacho, Melissa; Jackson, Linda]|[ur.01253317563.89; ; ur.01070755763.48]|Visual Studies|2004|19|1|36-51|10.1080/1472586042000204834|pub.1003263818|10;[Mariscal, Judith]|[ur.07365701451.47]|Telecommunications Policy|2005|29|5-6|409-428|10.1016/j.telpol.2005.03.004|pub.1015198978|84;[Paul, Johnson]|[]|Program|2002|36|1|13-22|10.1108/00330330210426085|pub.1020614063|21;[Abbey, Beverly; Smith-Gratto, Karen]|[; ur.010027107243.34]|Instructional and Cognitive Impacts of Web-Based Education|2000|||227-240|10.4018/978-1-878289-59-9.ch015|pub.1025031003|8;[Cullen, Rowena]|[ur.01027321712.95]|Online Information Review|2001|25|5|311-320|10.1108/14684520110410517|pub.1029188033|166;[Dutton, William H; Gillett, Sharon Eisner; McKnight, Lee W; Peltu, Malcolm]|[ur.014650741236.96; ur.014205054675.54; ur.012217645045.27; ur.012471563332.27]|Journal of Information Technology|2004|19|1|28-38|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000007|pub.1031322946|48;[Shneiderman, Ben]|[ur.013052653253.13]|Interactions|2001|8|2|11-15|10.1145/361897.361905|pub.1033617266|14;[James, Jeffrey]|[ur.07532230071.92]|Journal of Information Technology|2004|19|3|172-177|10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000019|pub.1034378460|27;[Mutch, A.]|[ur.012410736264.80]|International Journal of Information Management|1997|17|5|377-386|10.1016/s0268-4012(97)00017-0|pub.1042968864|48;[LAM, JOLIE C.Y.; LEE, MATTHEW K.O.]|[ur.014013517107.02; ur.013410357334.97]|Journal of Management Information Systems|2006|22|4|177-206|10.2753/mis0742-1222220407|pub.1047015084|121;[O'Neill, Edward T.; Lavoie, Brian F.; Bennett, Rick]|[; ; ]|D-Lib Magazine|2003|9|4||10.1045/april2003-lavoie|pub.1056730674|49;[Alkali, Yoram Eshet; Amichai-Hamburger, Yair]|[; ur.013225150321.95]|Cyberpsychology Behavior and Social Networking|2004|7|4|421-429|10.1089/cpb.2004.7.421|pub.1059246667|142;[James, Jeffrey]|[]|Journal of Information Science|2005|31|2|114-123|10.1177/0165551505050788|pub.1063750985|40;[Aula, Anne; Käki, Mika]|[ur.014550537375.51; ur.013155576375.67]|First Monday|2005||||10.5210/fm.v10i7.1254|pub.1072709253|15;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|999;[Riggins, Frederick; Dewan, Sanjeev]|[; ]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2005|6|12|298-337|10.17705/1jais.00074|pub.1100731533|304;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2006|7|1|52-67|10.17705/1jais.00076|pub.1100760197|36;[Benbasat, Izak; Goldstein, David K.; Mead, Melissa]|[ur.0745713632.15; ur.010634400236.08; ur.011431760636.42]|MIS Quarterly|1987|11|3|369|10.2307/248684|pub.1102514750|2266;[Gómez, Ricardo]|[]|Current History|2000|99|634|72-77|10.1525/curh.2000.99.634.72|pub.1127800624|8"

I began this essay after an energizing meeting with a bright young scholar on starting a new journal for africaresource.com . The journal, we agreed, would address the knowledge concerns of a politically conscious generation engaged in transformatory critical scholarship. Its distinguishing feature would be the New Afrikan perspective that would offer radical readings of texts and cultural phenomena. Just as our discussion drew to a close the critical question came: So what exactly does africaresource.com stand for?

Papers in this minitrack address how public policies, laws and governance are related to the use and development of information and communication technologies (ICT) both in government and in society at large. Government policies and legislation can create the technological environment and the necessary boundaries for e-government and e-democracy applications and services. At the organizational level, this includes aspects of equal access rights, privacy protection, public safety, security, and information dissemination. In the context of government information systems and at the infrastructure level, it encompasses the introduction of national ID cards, central citizen registries, data centers, public key infrastructure and Internet-based infrastructure. Policy issues and their analysis pertain to the digital divide, infrastructure development, use of open source and standards and educational uses of ICT.

These issues have been traditionally addressed in separate events although intricately related. By bringing together these interrelated issues, GIIS aims at stimulating interdisciplinary symposium sessions and workshops to discuss, built and further the use of local, regional and global information infrastructures. The symposium theme “closing the digital divide” reflects another primary motivation behind the launch of GIIS that is to promote the development of information infrastructures in underserved regions such as rural areas and developing countries.

This will develop into the next-generation of mobile communications(4G) with faster transmission of increased volumes of data in the future. The new cell layout requires the cellular configuration of 4G and the 4G services have to more offer a universal service of mobile communication and to more reduce a digital divide. We would need the legislation with respect to base station and to building the mobile communication networks, as well as the optimization of mobile communication systems.

In this essay we discuss the design of a technology that interweaves developments in new materials, electronics and software, and seeks to provide a cheap and accessible solution to creating new affinities between digital content, in whatever form, and ordinary paper. The technology and its design draws from a broad range of field studies, including research in classrooms and museums. These delineate the requirements and considerations that inform solutions to enhancing paper whilst preserving its integrity. The paper also discusses a naturalistic experiment, an evaluation in a museum, where we assessed the technology and the solution. We also chart the progressive development of this solution and the ways in which seemingly simple actions and issues became reconstituted as highly complex technical and analytic problems.",Proceedings of the 2004 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '04,2004,,,523-532,"Luff, Paul; Heath, Christian; Norrie, Moira; Signer, Beat; Herdman, Peter",King's College London; ETH Zurich,United Kingdom; Switzerland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045284975,55,"[Mackay, Wendy E.; Pothier, Guillaume; Letondal, Catherine; Bøegh, Kaare; Sørensen, Hans Erik]|[ur.013715735771.16; ; ur.07363425061.20; ; ]|Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '02|2002|||41-50|10.1145/571985.571992|pub.1001723692|108;[Harrison, Steve; Minneman, Scott; Back, Maribeth; Balsamo, Anne; Chow, Mark; Gold, Rich; Gorbet, Matt; Dale/Ehrlich, Kate Mac Donald; Henderson, Austin]|[ur.013433236137.05; ur.010367227033.01; ur.016313124466.07; ur.010373412107.20; ur.011766353107.86; ur.016301102707.10; ur.013361314107.16; ; ur.013355117735.60]|Interactions|2001|8|3|21-30|10.1145/369825.369829|pub.1003674600|16;[Luff, Paul; Heath, Christian]|[ur.013725525125.82; ur.01111666703.81]|Proceedings of the 1998 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '98|1998|||305-314|10.1145/289444.289505|pub.1007635572|346;[Wellner, Pierre]|[]|Proceedings of the 4th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '91|1991|||27-33|10.1145/120782.120785|pub.1008645469|181;[McGee, David R.; Cohen, Philip R.; Wu, Lizhong]|[ur.012235765633.27; ur.01044243264.46; ur.013347201063.51]|Proceedings of DARE 2000 on Designing augmented reality environments  - DARE '00|2000|||71-80|10.1145/354666.354674|pub.1013938137|37;[Kindberg, Tim; Barton, John; Morgan, Jeff; Becker, Gene; Caswell, Debbie; Debaty, Philippe; Gopal, Gita; Frid, Marcos; Krishnan, Venky; Morris, Howard; Schettino, John; Serra, Bill; Spasojevic, Mirjana]|[ur.014573320471.62; ur.011464400125.02; ur.011711433734.02; ur.013304374734.92; ; ur.012227661551.86; ur.012433316235.15; ur.011622535003.47; ur.014727606311.38; ur.014745451134.32; ur.015122167361.89; ur.016275713411.08; ur.015542717637.08]|Mobile Networks and Applications|2002|7|5|365-376|10.1023/a:1016591616731|pub.1016847829|192;[Arai, Toshifumi; Aust, Dietmar; Hudson, Scott E.]|[; ; ur.011131502035.46]|Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems|1997|||327-334|10.1145/258549.258782|pub.1018950159|78;[Bannon, Liam J.]|[ur.012173060313.11]|Workplace Studies|2000|||230-241|10.1017/cbo9780511628122.012|pub.1021456204|18;[Suchman, Lucy]|[]|Workplace Studies|2000|||29-45|10.1017/cbo9780511628122.003|pub.1022674979|63;[Nelson, Les; Ichimura, Satoshi; Pedersen, Elin Rønby; Adams, Lia]|[ur.013135322335.98; ; ur.015044574661.21; ]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems the CHI is the limit - CHI '99|1999|||354-361|10.1145/302979.303109|pub.1025244636|71;[Heath, Christian; Luff, Paul]|[ur.01111666703.81; ur.013725525125.82]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|1992|1|1-2|69-94|10.1007/bf00752451|pub.1025904002|547;[Signer, Beat; Norrie, Moira C.]|[ur.07617211137.35; ur.07607314301.91]|Proceedings of the fourteenth ACM conference on Hypertext and hypermedia  - HYPERTEXT '03|2003|||106-107|10.1145/900051.900073|pub.1035318227|9;[Siio, Itiro; Masui, Toshiyuki; Fukuchi, Kentaro]|[ur.011205071205.02; ur.015235303117.15; ]|Proceedings of the 12th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '99|1999|||113-119|10.1145/320719.322592|pub.1036114185|41;[Heath, Christian; Jirotka, Marina; Luff, Paul; Hindmarsh, Jon]|[ur.01111666703.81; ur.013153023115.00; ur.013725525125.82; ur.014507720655.06]|Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)|1994|3|2|147-165|10.1007/bf00773445|pub.1040292363|89;[]|[]|ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|2001|8|4|307-322|10.1145/504704.504706|pub.1040742451|123;[Aoki, Paul M.; Grinter, Rebecca E.; Hurst, Amy; Szymanski, Margaret H.; Thornton, James D.; Woodruff, Allison]|[ur.014050636773.88; ur.016103064677.56; ur.015551401371.54; ur.016152544267.64; ur.015163275105.64; ur.011025263141.44]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Changing our world, changing ourselves - CHI '02|2002|||431-438|10.1145/503376.503454|pub.1042168732|137;[Heath, Christian; Luff, Paul]|[ur.01111666703.81; ur.013725525125.82]|Proceedings of the 1996 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '96|1996|||354-363|10.1145/240080.240342|pub.1042463207|187;[Schmidt, Kjeld]|[ur.011042157646.81]|Workplace Studies|2000|||141-149|10.1017/cbo9780511628122.007|pub.1048314287|54;[Braun, D.; Heeger, A.

The survey has revealed the geographical distribution of server sites as well as their connection environments. It has been found that the percentage of offshore (out of home country) servers is as high as 80% and more than half of these are located in Europe. Offshore servers not only provide little benefit to the people of the country to which each ccTLD rightly belongs but their existence also heightens the risk of a country being unable to control them with its own policies and regulations.

It explains why these outcomes are not predetermined by the technology, but unfold over time through the complex interplay among many actors, in many arenas. A framework is presented to assist in addressing the issue of digital divides and other areas of research, policy and practice affected by the design and use of broadband Internet and related ICTs.",Journal of Information Technology,2004,19,1,28-38,"Dutton, William H; Gillett, Sharon Eisner; McKnight, Lee W; Peltu, Malcolm",University of Oxford; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Syracuse University,United Kingdom; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031322946,48,"[Williams, Robin; Edge, David]|[ur.0607431250.90; ]|Research Policy|1996|25|6|865-899|10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2|pub.1042209881|709;[Dutton, William H.]|[ur.014650741236.96]|Communication Theory|1992|2|4|303-328|10.1111/j.1468-2885.1992.tb00046.x|pub.1042909655|57;[Blumenthal, Marjory S.; Clark, David D.]|[ur.01077020102.85; ur.07747203221.27]|ACM Transactions on Internet Technology|2001|1|1|70-109|10.1145/383034.383037|pub.1050437786|243;[Clark, David D.; Gillett, Sharon E.; Lehr, William; Sirbu, Marvin A.; Fountain, Jane E.]|[ur.016140163377.28; ur.014205054675.54; ur.016001202377.84; ur.01266612756.45; ur.01266154474.29]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2003||||10.2139/ssrn.372260|pub.1102178424|9"

There is a need to consider user psychology as well as demography, as shown by research that has evaluated the use and effectiveness of health information and advice services provided via the television. The assumption is that simply providing access to online public services via the country’s most widespread and popular mass medium will guarantee their success, but this assumption is naïve in terms of its understanding of viewer psychology. To ensure success, it is essential to know more about the usability and application effectiveness of interactive services provided through television.

To resolve this problem, we proposed the life support system which is called “e-house”, using an information network technology. Since the information infrastructure was different according to the living environment of the elderly, we had to develop the method to cancell the digital divide. We constructed the home network system which adopted a power-line network. The result of the experiment of communication using power-line network shows the power-line network has enough band width to transfer the biomedical signals like an ECG. In addition, we developed the WWW based tele-monitoring system for the elderly. As the result of experiments, we confirmed that this Web-based monitoring system is effective for the tele-monitoring of the health condition of the elderly.",Journal of Life Support Engineering,2001,13,4,112,"NAMBU, Masayuki; SUENAGA, Takatoshi; ICHINOSEKI, Noriko; NAKAJIMA, Kazuki; TAMURA, Toshiyo",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014118575,1,

However, little systematic study has examined the variation in firm decisions to adopt the Internet. I explore the sources of this variation by examining Internet adoption decisions in a very large sample of organizations in the finance and services sector in 1998. I show how prior information technology (IT) investments and workplace organization decisions affect the returns to adopting simple and complex Internet technologies. I show that recent investments in client/server (C/S) networking applications have competing effects on the likelihood of Internet adoption. Such investments can slow adoption by acting as a short-run substitute or by creating “switching costs.” Geographic dispersion of employees is complementary with Internet adoption, suggesting that Internet technology lowered internal coordination costs. Increases in organization size and external pressure also increase the likelihood of adoption.",Management Science,2005,51,4,641-654,"Forman, Chris",Carnegie Mellon University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064714371,157,"[Bresnahan, Timothy F.; Trajtenberg, M.]|[ur.013306211413.20; ur.016622504767.96]|Journal of Econometrics|1995|65|1|83-108|10.1016/0304-4076(94)01598-t|pub.1015878906|1317;[Tan, Margaret; Teo, Thompson S.H.]|[ur.012352326603.61; ur.014043136677.02]|International Journal of Electronic Commerce|1998|2|3|5-18|10.1080/10864415.1998.11518312|pub.1018756826|71;[Irwin, Douglas A.; Klenow, Peter J.]|[ur.07373476567.10; ur.010423026174.84]|Journal of Political Economy|1994|102|6|1200-1227|10.1086/261968|pub.1058575449|368;[Goolsbee, Austan; Klenow, Peter J.]|[ur.014677654741.57; ur.010423026174.84]|The Journal of Law and Economics|2002|45|2|317-343|10.1086/344399|pub.1058640424|227;[Tornatzky, L.

Specifically, the proposed fusion environment realizes a unified infrastructure that changes traditional, passive urban users into active, information society participants capable of creating, manipulating, and distributing their own content/services over a commonly exploited infrastructure. Further, the environment enables triple-play services and always-on connectivity in rural areas, that is, in regions where there is no termination of the core backbone to the local PSTN/ISDN exchanger. Finally, the article describes important directions for future research to follow to exploit the proposed IP/DVB unified platform for the synergy of emerging broadcasting, telecommunications, wireless, and wired technologies, to alleviate the digital divide that currently exists not only among countries but also within most countries",IEEE Network,2007,21,2,21-27,"Mastorakis, G.; Kormentzas, G.; Pallis, E.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061411540,18,"[Kouis, Dimitris; Loukatos, Dimitris; Kontovasilis, Kimon; Kormentzas, George; Skianis, Charalabos]|[ur.011242152251.38; ; ur.015713070763.18; ur.016342371332.32; ur.016030265777.32]|Computer Networks|2005|48|1|57-73|10.1016/j.comnet.2004.10.008|pub.1005642361|11;[Skianis, C.; Kormentzas, G.; Kontovasilis, K.]|[ur.016030265777.32; ur.016342371332.32; ur.015713070763.18]|Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing|2005|5|6|679-695|10.1002/wcm.334|pub.1026723829|19;[Pallis, Evangelos; Mantakas, Charalambos; Mastorakis, George; Kourtis, Anastasios; Zacharopoulos, Vassilios]|[ur.016344123075.91; ur.07523064365.69; ur.015557346701.99; ur.012616503623.96; ur.014115101142.22]|European Transactions on Telecommunications|2006|17|2|175-182|10.1002/ett.1099|pub.1052971685|18;[CALYAM, PRASAD; LEE, CHANG-GUN]|[ur.0612120307.38; ur.015313577023.88]|New Trends in Computer Networks|2005|||83-92|10.1142/9781860947308_0009|pub.1096050862|23"

On the other hand there has been too much focus on many technical aspects of public participation with reduced focus on the citizens. Equal opportunities to express their opinions and an open debate between people are the basic foundation for democracy. Therefore the design of participatory processes must take outset in the citizens and their knowledge and commitment concerning the issue to be debated. The current paper presents the results of a survey among actively involved citizens in Northern Jutland County. Our analysis shows a high degree of involvement among middle-age well-educated males with a higher education and income above average.

pub.1007594988,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2004.10.001,Technology and society: socioeconomic influences on technological sectors for United States counties,"This paper analyzes socioeconomic influences on technological levels for 164 counties in the United States. The conceptual framework is that social and economic dimensions impact the sizes of technology sectors in counties, i.e. technology does not develop by itself but in concert with pre-disposing characteristics of the environment. Based on correlation and regression analyses, the findings reveal that nationally in the US, factors that are important correlates of technology sectors are professional/scientific/technical services workforce, other services workforce, household income, federal grant funds, college education, and ethnicity. The study reveals a large range in technology levels across the nation.

However, by December 2002, only a few thousand homes had adopted the technology. This paper examines the implementation and regulation of digital TV in Australia from the point of view of the ‘established base’ the new technology will replace, theories on diffusion and innovation of new technologies, and the Justification Model, which sees technology choice as social gambling. It then evaluates the various protectionist regulations and limitations imposed on the technology to safeguard the various stakeholders, the implementation strategies used, lack of digital content, marketing efforts, negative media coverage, and the economic realities of the technology, and argues that if consumers reject the technology altogether, it would lead to Australia missing the future applications of digital technology and the opportunity to address the issue of the ‘digital divide’ in the 21st century.",InSITE Conference,2003,,,,"D.

In this paper, we propose a method of providing a voice interface for access to Web pages using a Web browser. Specifically, VoiceXML metadata, which contains an oral interaction scenario, is placed in the Web server along with the associated HTML data. Two alternative methods are considered for the client terminal to acquire this metadata: the built-in address method and the self-acquisition method. We have also developed a method of synchronizing oral interactions with the Web page display. We have built an experimental system, and used it to confirm that the proposed method operates as intended.","International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies (UBICOMM'07)",2007,,,89-94,"Hayashi, Nobutaka; Takami, Kazumasa",Soka University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094032549,0,"[Takami, Kazumasa; Yamaguchi, Takako; Unno, Kiyoshi]|[ur.016616322521.26; ; ]|2006 First International Conference on Communications and Electronics|2006|||398-401|10.1109/cce.2006.350883|pub.1093955374|3"

It then delineates sectors worth researching, given the influence of globalization and the speed of technological advance. The societal impact of these problem areas cannot be ignored, as they are significant. From the viewpoints of the consumer and society, the decrease in small shops and the concentration of retailing might have negative effects; such as increased unemployment coupled with lower personal service offerings. This article further suggests that policy makers should pay attention to the ‘Digital Divide.’ The technological skills required to work effectively in the ‘Digital Age’ are separating skilled workers from others. It may not be possible to retrain significant numbers of other workers for many of the ‘new economy’ professions.

The authors extensively explore these pervading technologies as they impact on the education, commerce, social, cultural, and economic life of the poor Tanzanian people. The chapter looks at how Tanzania is coping with the issue of poverty eradication as one of the eight UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It addresses the issue of digital divide and the role that ICTs can play in poverty reduction. Tanzania’s efforts in embracing ICTs and the challenges facing the country in its efforts are also addressed. Overall, the chapter demonstrates that ICTs are a set of tools for knowledge sharing, which is a powerful means for poverty reduction. Furthermore, it is advisable to focus on information literacy rather than just focusing on computer literacy.",Information and Communication Technologies for Economic and Regional Developments,2007,,,305-319,"Rahman, Hakikur; Yonah, Zaipuna O.; Salim, Baanda A.",Sokoine University of Agriculture,Tanzania,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1020977128,1,

The role of information and communication technology in cross-country level and growth estimates,"The bulk of information and communication technology is made of weightless, implementable, and infinitely reproducible knowledge products (such as software and databases). These products are transferred by telephone lines, accessed through internet hosts, and processed through personal computers. In this work, the coefficient of the labour augmenting factor in the aggregate production function has been estimated using proxies of variables crucially affecting the diffusion of (non-rival and almost non-excludable) knowledge products. This specification provides interesting answers to some of the open issues in the existing growth literature. The most recent information, though available for a limited period, shows that telephone lines, personal computers, mobile phones, and internet hosts significantly affect levels and growth of income per worker across countries. The result is robust to changes in sample composition, econometric specification, and estimation approach. †E-mail: f.adriani@bristol.ac.uk †E-mail: f.adriani@bristol.ac.uk",Economics of Innovation and New Technology,2005,14,6,435-453,"Becchetti, Leonardo; Adriani†, Fabrizio",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Bristol,Italy; United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019551689,28,"[Becchetti, L.; Bedoya, David andres londono; Paganetto, L.]|[ur.013310205666.92; ur.013222736077.22; ur.014072725067.00]|Journal of Productivity Analysis|2003|20|2|143-167|10.1023/a:1025128121853|pub.1004846652|65;[Leventhal, Naomi]|[]|Information Systems Management|1986|3|1|22-26|10.1080/07399018608965224|pub.1005903165|6;[Wößmann, Ludger]|[ur.010424766345.26]|Journal of Economic Surveys|2003|17|3|239-270|10.1111/1467-6419.00195|pub.1007785574|183;[Pagano, Marco]|[ur.014457673060.38]|European Economic Review|1993|37|2-3|613-622|10.1016/0014-2921(93)90051-b|pub.1011760199|822;[Efron, B.]|[]|The Annals of Statistics|1979|7|1||10.1214/aos/1176344552|pub.1012894299|11244;[Jorgenson, Dale W.; Ho, Mun S.; Stiroh, Kevin J.]|[ur.012327275705.42; ur.014517617305.26; ur.012362462064.30]|Technology, Growth, and the Labor Market|2003|||19-40|10.1007/978-1-4615-0325-5_3|pub.1013346352|49;[Evans, Paul]|[]|The Review of Economics and Statistics|1997|79|2|219-225|10.1162/003465397556809|pub.1017376450|116;[Erickson, Timothy]|[]|Econometrica|2001|69|1|221-222|10.1111/1468-0262.00185|pub.1019183170|11;[Efron, B.; Tibshirani, R.]|[; ]|Statistical Science|1986|1|1||10.1214/ss/1177013815|pub.1021018321|4574;[Bender, Donald H.]|[]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1986|3|2|22-32|10.1080/07421222.1986.11517760|pub.1022216278|123;[Efron, B.; Stein, C.]|[; ]|The Annals of Statistics|1981|9|3||10.1214/aos/1176345462|pub.1026797736|938;[Antonelli, Cristiano]|[ur.016105373552.67]|Information Economics and Policy|2003|15|2|173-199|10.1016/s0167-6245(02)00093-8|pub.1030504131|63;[Jorgenson, Dale Weldeau; Stiroh, Kevin J.]|[ur.012327275705.42; ur.012362462064.30]|Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|2000|2000|1|125-210|10.1353/eca.2000.0008|pub.1031925788|795;[Rousseau, P.L.; Wachtel, P.]|[ur.011142431221.59; ur.014123036731.08]|Journal of Banking & Finance|2000|24|12|1933-1957|10.1016/s0378-4266(99)00123-5|pub.1040681421|387;[Perotti, Roberto]|[ur.012454507425.98]|Journal of Economic Growth|1996|1|2|149-187|10.1007/bf00138861|pub.1053705392|1118;[Barro, Robert J.]|[]|Journal of Political Economy|1992|100|2|223-251|10.1086/261816|pub.1058575297|3147;[Barro, R.

Older users still use the Web less than younger users, and more commonly experience significant usability issues when they do. With the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies, we have the ability to close that divide and ensure the Web is universally usable for people of all ages. It requires taking what we know of “senior surfer” requirements and applying them to Web 2.0 interfaces.

pub.1006240417,10.1016/j.lisr.2006.03.007,A content analysis of Latina Web content,"Studies of the digital divide have focused on lack of access to hardware, software, connectivity, and computer skills. Newer studies point to the existence of other factors such as the lack of culturally relevant content. Driven by this issue, this study provides a preliminary map of the “nature” of Web-based content about U.S. Latinas, a community that has traditionally been underrepresented in information systems. The nature of the content was explored and analyzed by examining attributes such as type of site, language of site, topic(s), producer(s) of site, technical features, and targeted audience. The study also theorizes the lack of relevant content and discusses the possible social implications of the disparities in access to digital information technologies. Using content analysis, the study provides a framework with which to categorize and analyze Web content. The results suggest content areas that need development and potential information barriers to consider in the process.",Library & Information Science Research,2006,28,2,297-324,"Salinas, Romelia","University of California, Los Angeles",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006240417,5,"[Lievrouw, Leah A.; Farb, Sharon E.]|[ur.015617015543.53; ur.015052574702.41]|Annual Review of Information Science and Technology|2005|37|1|499-540|10.1002/aris.1440370112|pub.1007100288|82;[Drori, Gili S.; Jang, Yong Suk]|[ur.012027540031.10; ]|Social Science Computer Review|2003|21|2|144-161|10.1177/0894439303021002002|pub.1007361784|50;[Wathen, C.

pub.1094180591,10.1109/icet.2005.1558888,SIP-Based QoS Control over Satellite Networks,"Satelliteaccess networks (SAN) are expected to play a decisive role in bridging the digital divide through providing broadband access to multimedia services in geographical area where terrestrial access networks like cable or ADSL cannot be deployed. SANs currently lack a clear QoS architecture in order to fit seamlessly into the end-to-end NGN framework. Several architectures mixing IP QoS layer mechanisms with specific satellite MAC dynamic allocation schemes are already designed. However, very few multimedia applications can actually benefit from these architectures since most of them are not QoS aware. This work presents a SIP based multimedia signaling architecture where existing SIP applications can beneficiate from a QoS enabled IP network without undergoing any adjustments or modifications. In addition to that, the realization of the proposed solution is also described along with its performance evaluation tests and their results on an emulated satellite platform, providing DiffServ services, which was implemented during the European IST SATIP6 project.","Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Emerging Technologies, 2005.",2005,,,242-245,"Qureshi, Rehan Inam; Alphand, Olivier",Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology,Pakistan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1094180591,0,

Currently, however, an age-related digital divide exists, especially for lower SES minority elderly. This study examined the ability of a sample of 40 community dwelling adults aged 50–85 yrs. to use the Internet to make choices related to Medicare services. Performance data included response time, accuracy, and search behavior (based on videotape recordings) and ratings of usability. Overall the data indicate that although most of the of participants were able to find the needed information many of them made errors, used inefficient search strategies, and encountered search problems. Furthermore, most of the sample indicated problems with usability and that they were frustrated interacting with the website. These findings are discussed in terms of recommendations for training and website design.

pub.1050981326,10.1002/itdj.20004,"Less cyber, more café: Enhancing existing small businesses across the digital divide with ICTs","About 10% of the world has access to information and communication technologies (ICTs). Telecenters and cyber cafés are one prevalent way to increase access. This paper suggests increasing access through currently existing, local businesses where people already gather and where proprietors already posses existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. This paper questions the prevailing emphasis on the “cyber'' characteristics of access, e.g., computing and internet access as is currently known, and attempts to refocus the conversation by considering computing and access in the context of the “café,” e.g., as public life in the sense of Habermas, which permits an in situ evolution of relevant access. This analysis is based on extant literature and direct ethnographic research in several public places in six countries. We offer example design perspectives based on a reflection of “third places” as inspiration for appropriate innovation in the provision of computing and communications. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Information Technology for Development,2005,11,1,77-95,"Salvador, Tony; Sherry, John W.; Urrutia, Alvaro E.",Intel (United States),United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050981326,36,"[Gurstein, Michael]|[]|First Monday|2003|8|12||10.5210/fm.v8i12.1107|pub.1072710821|189;[]|[]|Historic Documents of 1998|1999|||522-598|10.4135/9781483302553.n8|pub.1087948903|16;[Castells, Manuel]|[]||2001||||10.1007/978-3-322-89613-1|pub.1109708492|1318"

Government initiatives to widen participation in education mean that students from hitherto non‐traditional backgrounds are more likely to be using libraries than previously. That the much discussed “digital divide” is indeed a reality, is confirmed by the author’s own recent research, “Barriers to libraries as agents of lifelong learning”, conducted at a UK university and two further education colleges. Social class and home access to information technology are shown as dividers impacting on the extent of use of all services offered by the learning resource centre.

Because African countries rank very low on the global measure of e-government readiness, critical variables were studied to find out which policy and programmatic areas should become priority in bridging the gap. Findings from a multiple regression analysis indicate that the low ranking of African countries on the global e-government readiness index indicates that the countries would need to develop, first, the internal utilization capacity as well as an enhanced public access to information, communication, and technology (ICT) infrastructures. These would, in turn, generate the demand necessary to spur increased government investment in ICT infrastructural development.

pub.1014550534,10.1007/978-3-540-73279-2_111,RFID Cards: A New Deal for Elderly Accessibility,"Elderly adults face two serious challenges bridging the digital divide. First, many suffer from physical or cognitive disabilities, which inhibit computer use. Second, the “traditional” personal computer interface constitutes a foreign and forbidding paradigm. Consequently, elderly adults are less likely to access the Internet, and this lack of accessibility denies them increased social contact and access to information. This paper presents the design of a tangible user interface (TUI) for an email client that is suited to the physical, neurological, and cognitive needs of elderly users. A review of the TUI literature identifies radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged cards, integrated with standard personal computers, as a viable alternative to the mouse. These cards can represent interaction objects and actions, forming the basis for an interaction language. The email client interaction design illustrates many simple and advanced RFID card interaction techniques.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4554,,990-999,"Pastel, Robert; Wallace, Charles; Heines, Jesse",Michigan Technological University; University of Massachusetts Lowell,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014550534,3,"[Walker, Neff; Philbin, David A.; Fisk, Arthur D.]|[ur.01011261364.92; ur.01301163661.71; ur.01305446237.31]|The Journals of Gerontology Series B|1997|52B|1|p40-p53|10.1093/geronb/52b.1.p40|pub.1004635496|194;[KELLEY, CATHERINE L.; CHARNESS, NEIL]|[; ur.01111200776.06]|Behaviour and Information Technology|1995|14|2|107-120|10.1080/01449299508914630|pub.1007633395|146;[Davidoff, Scott; Bloomberg, Carson; Li, Ian Anthony R.; Mankoff, Jennifer; Fussell, Susan R.]|[ur.015345447373.85; ; ur.016576776417.14; ur.012655461423.03; ur.013653535022.01]|CHI '05 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems|2005|||1331-1334|10.1145/1056808.1056909|pub.1008149376|14;[Rekimoto, Jun; Ullmer, Brygg; Oba, Haruo]|[ur.012476504203.81; ur.07641337703.20; ur.016054666115.21]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '01|2001|||269-276|10.1145/365024.365115|pub.1013438111|139;[Madsen, Kim Halskov]|[ur.07534135615.59]|Communications of the ACM|1994|37|12|57-62|10.1145/198366.198381|pub.1015016908|89;[Fitzmaurice, George W.; Buxton, William]|[ur.012141303053.37; ur.013256261515.74]|Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems|1997|||43-50|10.1145/258549.258578|pub.1018611145|121;[Hughes, John A.; Randall, David; Shapiro, Dan]|[; ; ]|Proceedings of the 1992 ACM conference on Computer-supported cooperative work - CSCW '92|1992|||115-122|10.1145/143457.143469|pub.1019625065|273;[Ishii, Hiroshi; Ullmer, Brygg]|[ur.015664645335.87; ur.07641337703.20]|Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems|1997|||234-241|10.1145/258549.258715|pub.1019864838|2226;[White, Heidi; McConnell, Eleanor; Clipp, Elizabeth; Bynum, Louise; Teague, Carmen; Navas, Luis; Craven, Sara; Halbrecht, Herbert]|[ur.01332615357.77; ur.0625474172.37; ur.01231615002.51; ; ; ; ; ]|Journal of Applied Gerontology|1999|18|3|358-378|10.1177/073346489901800306|pub.1022345985|162;[Mitchell, David B.; Brown, Alan S.; Murphy, Dana R.]|[ur.015610000252.51; ur.01305102627.59; ur.0675013454.49]|Psychology and Aging|1990|5|2|264-276|10.1037/0882-7974.5.2.264|pub.1029402696|104;[Jacob, Robert J.

Rural Indian population is not as fortune as the urban population in terms of access to quality education system (technical education) and information & communication technology infrastructure of cities. The Information Technology (IT) Giant India needs to take its development programs of education, health, technology, agriculture to the masses to eliminate disparities, specifically the digital divide. India has an excellent education system of more than 380 universities and 1265 engineering colleges [4] providing IT education in the country. Despite this the availability of trained manpower is in short supply as far as IT manpower is concerned. As projected in many reports India could face a shortage of 0.5 million skilled IT manpower by 2009. These statistics are indicative of the fact that there is a need of other alternatives to reduce the digital divide (Rural V/s Urban) in the country and also to fill the gap of shortage of IT trained manpower. In such a scenario e-Learning could play a vital role since its enabler, IT infrastructure is developing in India at a very fast pace as it is evident with the development of Business Process Outsourcing industry and number of telephone users in the country. The President of India in his address (4                     th                     August, 2004) to the children of the nation said “education is the catalyst of change” and ‘Information Technology is the major driving force and change agent”. To achieve the objective of providing education to all children, he announced the project “EDUSAT”, which would install 150,000 ground terminals in the country. In addition new initiative of e-Government policies of the government are encouraging the usage of information technology in all sectors of the economy including education. In the nutshell, India has a conducive environment where e-Learning could develop in future to solve many problems of education especially in rural India. Keeping this in background, author presented in this paper, various facets of e-Learning in India, present status of e-Learning activities, major organizations & their technologies for creating e-Learning information systems, regulatory framework, government initiations, impact of e-Learning technologies on the education system.

Development of strategies to help insure that older people have equal opportunities to access computer technology depends on understanding why they have lower adoption rates. This paper examines changes in attitudes towards computers over time among a sample of 745 adults ranging in age from 18 — 75 yrs. Attitudes towards computers were assessed using the Attitudes Towards Computers Questionnaire across two time periods: 1994-1997 and 2000-2004. Over time, participants rated computers as less dehumanizing and reported an increased belief that computers were equally important to both genders. There were also age groups differences in ratings of comfort, efficacy, and control. The older adults reported less comfort, competence with computers. Over time, perceptions of having control over computers increased over time for the younger people but not for the middle-aged and older people. Understanding individual differences in attitudes towards computers is important to the design of intervention strategies such as training programs.",Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting,2005,49,2,154-157,"Nair, Sankaran N.; Lee, Chin Chin; Czaja, Sara J.",University of Miami,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1064048812,1,"[Regan, Dennis T; Fazio, Russell]|[ur.0100256610.85; ur.01300734724.15]|Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|1977|13|1|28-45|10.1016/0022-1031(77)90011-7|pub.1002055695|277;[Marquié, J.C.; Thon, B.; Baracat, B.]|[ur.01045736715.08; ur.01072437326.18; ur.0656074622.12]|Applied Ergonomics|1994|25|3|130-142|10.1016/0003-6870(94)90011-6|pub.1007089589|36;[Czaja, Sara J.; Sharit, Joseph; Ownby, Raymond; Roth, David L.; Nair, Sankaran]|[ur.0617044560.40; ur.0776356414.83; ur.014144540537.08; ur.0652727665.23; ur.01354262137.97]|Psychology and Aging|2001|16|4|564-579|10.1037/0882-7974.16.4.564|pub.1010672875|122;[Czaja, Sara J.; Sharit, Joseph]|[ur.0617044560.40; ur.0776356414.83]|The Journals of Gerontology Series B|1998|53B|5|p329-p340|10.1093/geronb/53b.5.p329|pub.1014533433|273;[Folstein, Marshal F.; Folstein, Susan E.; McHugh, Paul R.]|[ur.0735330504.84; ur.01071033744.61; ur.01203245430.40]|Journal of Psychiatric Research|1975|12|3|189-198|10.1016/0022-3956(75)90026-6|pub.1027523106|70537;[Sharit, Joseph; Czaja, Sara J.; Hernandez, Mario; Yang, Yulong; Perdomo, Dolores; Lewis, John E.; Lee, Chin Chin; Nair, Sankaran]|[ur.0776356414.83; ur.0617044560.40; ur.01061465076.00; ur.01052733466.28; ur.01014270002.12; ur.01257720747.13; ur.01022136524.86; ur.01354262137.97]|The Journals of Gerontology Series B|2004|59|6|p305-p316|10.1093/geronb/59.6.p305|pub.1033828641|43;[Czaja, Sara J.; Sharit, Joseph]|[ur.0617044560.40; ur.0776356414.83]|Journal of Experimental Psychology Applied|1998|4|4|332-351|10.1037/1076-898x.4.4.332|pub.1043982921|65;[Jay, G M; Willis, S L]|[ur.0656705556.22; ur.01372735671.40]|Journal of Gerontology|1992|47|4|p250-7|10.1093/geronj/47.4.p250|pub.1059628957|162;[Sharit, Joseph; Czaja, Sara J.; Nair, Sankaran; Lee, Chin Chin]|[ur.0776356414.83; ur.0617044560.40; ur.01354262137.97; ur.01022136524.86]|Human Factors The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|2003|45|2|234-251|10.1518/hfes.45.2.234.27245|pub.1067597711|50"
pub.1063750969,10.1177/0165551504045855,Challenges in the Delivery of E-Government through Kiosks,"Kiosks are increasingly being heralded as a technology through which governments, government departments and local authorities or municipalities can engage with citizens. In particular, they have attractions in their potential to bridge the digital divide. There is some evidence to suggest that the citizen uptake of kiosks and indeed other channels for e-government, such as web sites, is slow, although studies on the use of kiosks for health information provision offer some interesting perspectives on user behaviour with kiosk technology. This article argues that the delivery of e-government through kiosks presents a number of strategic challenges, which will need to be negotiated over the next few years in order that kiosk applications can be successful in enhancing accessibility to and engagement with e-government. The article suggests that this involves consideration of: the applications to be delivered through a kiosk; one stop shop service and knowledge architectures; mechanisms for citizen identification; and the integration of kiosks within the total interface between public bodies and their communities. The article concludes by outlining development and research agendas in each of these areas.",Journal of Information Science,2004,30,4,369-377,"Slack, Frances; Rowley, Jennifer E.",Sheffield Hallam University;

pub.1043548300,10.1007/11823100_9,‘Mind the Gap’: e-Government and e-Democracy,"It is claimed that Internet technology offers governments the opportunity to engage citizens online and bridge the growing gap between citizens and the state. In the current climate of citizen disengagement this is a potentially important prospect. Academic studies into e-government tend to follow a well-trodden path of technology acceptance, citizens’ willingness and ability to use public services online and the digital divide. Where issues of e-democracy are considered, studies generally highlight opportunities rather than measuring any actual changes in citizen behaviour. This study examines citizens’ perceptions, attitudes and behaviour, seeking specifically to expose whether citizens feel that e-government enhances democratic participation and brings them closer to government and the machinery of the state. In this paper we present the results of the pilot study which suggest that citizens perceive some moderate value in using e-government as a means of keeping themselves informed and communicating with the state, but little value in e-government as a tool of democratic participation.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2006,4084,,96-106,"Kolsaker, Ailsa; Lee-Kelley, Liz",University of Surrey,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043548300,16,"[Kolsaker, Ailsa; Lee‐Kelley, Liz; Choy, Pui Ching]|[ur.016622131027.01; ur.014047374707.20; ]|International Journal of Consumer Studies|2004|28|3|295-304|10.1111/j.1470-6431.2004.00373.x|pub.1000746621|49;[Ling, Tom]|[]|Public Administration|2002|80|4|615-642|10.1111/1467-9299.00321|pub.1002528519|293;[Cai, Shaohan; Jun, Minjoon]|[ur.011600477032.78; ur.014342621170.45]|Managing Service Quality: An International Journal|2003|13|6|504-519|10.1108/09604520310506568|pub.1004446643|150;[Lee-Kelley, Liz; James, Thomas]|[ur.014047374707.20; ur.011707456233.77]|Journal of Electronic Commerce in Organizations|2003|1|4|1-16|10.4018/jeco.2003100101|pub.1016160452|14;[Joint, Nicholas]|[ur.014717021372.50]|Library Review|2005|54|2|80-85|10.1108/00242530510583020|pub.1020771886|9;[Douglas, Alex; Muir, Lindsey; Meehan, Karon]|[ur.012442415135.10; ur.011047454135.05; ur.010770603463.64]|Managing Service Quality: An International Journal|2003|13|6|483-491|10.1108/09604520310506540|pub.1025598925|21;[Kuo, Ying-Feng]|[]|Total Quality Management & Business Excellence|2004|15|7|925-939|10.1080/14783360410001681854|pub.1025644507|82;[Szymanski, David M.; Hise, Richard T.]|[; ur.014161305105.45]|Journal of Retailing|2000|76|3|309-322|10.1016/s0022-4359(00)00035-x|pub.1033210171|1156;[Line, Maurice B.]|[ur.015601666107.12]|Library Management|2003|24|8/9|386-392|10.1108/01435120310501059|pub.1035338502|4;[Hsu, Meng-Hsiang; Chiu, Chao-Min]|[ur.010422123675.97; ur.07624543275.75]|Decision Support Systems|2004|38|3|369-381|10.1016/j.dss.2003.08.001|pub.1036932121|429;[Meuter, Matthew L.; Ostrom, Amy L.; Roundtree, Robert I.; Bitner, Mary Jo]|[ur.015112030015.81; ur.010275411025.95; ur.07501503221.41; ur.015407174021.11]|Journal of Marketing|2000|64|3|50-64|10.1509/jmkg.64.3.50.18024|pub.1040797064|1644;[Cavanaugh, John W.]|[]|National Civic Review|2000|89|3|229-234|10.1002/ncr.89305|pub.1042586435|12;[Barnes, Marian; Newman, Janet; Knops, Andrew; Sullivan, Helen]|[ur.011547543053.39; ur.012545273453.72; ur.013027067431.51; ur.01365601644.52]|Public Administration|2003|81|2|379-399|10.1111/1467-9299.00352|pub.1045101617|234;[Piccoli, Gabriele; Brohman, M.

pub.1024273626,10.1080/1369118032000068732,Addressing the Negative Consequences of the Information Age Lessons from Karl Polanyi and the industrial revolutionA note on the politics of theorizing technology,"One of the great dilemmas of the information age is the tension between two dynamics: (1) the tendency of information to be free-flowing and not to lose its value as it moves and (2) the tendency to want to control that flow of information in order to profit from its value. In 1944, Karl Polanyi identified similar contradictions in the industrial revolution, except the flowing material was capital instead of information. He spent a lifetime exposing what he felt to be the negative consequences of this increasingly free-flowing capital, the hallmark of a free market economy. He advocated for a welfare state in which government intervention is necessary to control these negative effects. Given issues of the information age such as the digital divide, the commoditization of information, and security and privacy, as well as the arguments of the proponents and critics of these issues, Polanyi's concepts can provide insight into the complexities of increasingly technical and information-based societies.",Information Communication & Society,2003,6,1,105-124,"Rogerson, Kenneth S.",Duke University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024273626,3,"[Braman, Sandra]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1989|13|3|233-242|10.1016/0308-5961(89)90006-2|pub.1001891590|81;[Ozawa, Terutomo; Castello, Sergio; Phillips, Ronnie J.]|[ur.07636730771.88; ur.010775623473.49; ]|Journal of Economic Issues|2001|35|2|289-298|10.1080/00213624.2001.11506362|pub.1021266350|10;[Boulding, K.

The increasing connectivity, together with the fact that IDTV users are no longer passive spectators, permits to start thinking on highly interactive services that support fluid communication among users and service providers. This may enhance the prospects of learning at home, as long as the current offer is mostly based on broadcast content, with scarce use of return channels for feedback. This paper proposes an extension to the Multimedia Home Platform standard, aimed at providing better support for collaborative learning services. We describe an architecture for such services and a selection of freely available technologies for their implementation. We also discuss the possible market implications of our approach, as the ideas presented here contribute to openness in the field of IDTV services.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2004,3143,,83-90,"López-Nores, Martín; Blanco-Fernández, Yolanda; Fernández-Vilas, Ana; Díaz-Redondo, Rebeca P.; Pazos-Arias, José J.; Gil-Solla, Alberto; García-Duque, Jorge; Barragáns-Martínez, Belén; Ramos-Cabrer, Manuel",Universidade de Vigo,Spain,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001447643,1,"[López-Nores, Martín; Fernández-Vilas, Ana; Díaz-Redondo, Rebeca P.; Gil-Solla, Alberto; Pazos-Arias, José J.; Ramos-Cabrer, Manuel; García-Duque, Jorge]|[ur.011063763046.69; ur.014576163641.79; ur.011717014421.23; ur.07526473021.41; ur.015344001302.47; ur.010324053421.21; ur.07471022046.60]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2003|2899||376-387|10.1007/978-3-540-40012-7_31|pub.1016987968|8;[Alexander, Shirley]|[ur.014634147551.15]|Education + Training|2001|43|4/5|240-248|10.1108/00400910110399247|pub.1048309221|190"
pub.1094157976,10.1109/iti.2007.4283818,A Services Management System for Small and Disadvantaged Communities,"Several kinds of citizens in Italy face significant obstacles during their interactions with public administrations and governments, having to cope with bureaucracy, ambiguous procedures, functional disintegration, vague and/or overlapping authority structures and information fragmentation. We present in this paper a modular system for e-Government services distribution that can be easily updated, extended and integrated with the existing information systems of public administrations (PAs). Our Services Management System is a framework that automatically generates the infrastructure for the classification and the distribution of selected services on the basis of the preferences expressed by the administrator.

pub.1041955449,10.1007/s101100100096,Constructing the divide: Spatial disparities in broadband access,"Abstract. As residential broadband options such as cable and xDSL grow in popularity, broadband providers continue to roll out service in select market areas. However, due to technological limitations, some locations qualify for xDSL broadband service while others do not. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of local geography on broadband (xDSL) network access. This type of micro-geographic analysis is important in two ways. First, a detailed analysis at the local level can reveal the spatial disparities in infrastructure access. Second, because broadband access is quickly emerging as the technology of choice for both small businesses and households, it is important to consider which locations will have opportunities for these connections and which locations will not. Utilising an integer programming model, the maximal covering location problem, and a geographic information system, xDSL broadband access is evaluated in Columbus, Ohio. Results indicate that many suburban areas can be left without adequate service.",Papers of the Regional Science Association,2002,81,2,197-221,"Grubesic, Tony H.; Murray, Alan T.",The Ohio State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041955449,88,

However, right from its inception, a number of controversies have surrounded the program including the right of the FCC to impose a “tax” on the telecommunications industry, the status of the Universal Service Administration Company, allegations of fraud in the allocation of funds to schools and libraries, and questions whether Internet access to schools was furthering the cause of educational equity. A number of these questions have been settled through court cases and administrative reform, but doubts about the future of the program still persist so much so that the US Congress is currently considering proposals to terminate or reform the e‐rate program. Keeping in mind these controversies and the achievements to date of the program, this paper compares a number of policy proposals that have been put forward recently. It recommends among other things that the future effectiveness of the e‐rate program may be best served by enabling a shift of funding from telecommunications access to software and content development.",Info,2004,6,1,37-51,"Jayakar, Krishna P.",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1025845183,10,"[Shuler, John A.]|[]|Government Information Quarterly|1999|16|4|359-369|10.1016/s0740-624x(00)86841-0|pub.1043114564|8;[]|[]|Network Security|2003|2003|11|14-15|10.1016/s1353-4858(03)01108-5|pub.1049209036|2;[Christmann, Edwin; Badgett, John; Lucking, Robert]|[ur.016136425333.74; ur.011273645035.46; ur.014266267121.71]|Journal of Research on Computing in Education|1997|29|4|325-337|10.1080/08886504.1997.10782202|pub.1049689962|29;[Bertot, John Carlo]|[ur.011253735727.32]|The Journal of Academic Librarianship|2000|26|1|45-48|10.1016/s0099-1333(99)00122-6|pub.1052440079|1;[Smeeding, Timothy M.]|[ur.01321767440.07]|Indicators|2002|1|3|6-30|10.1080/15357449.2002.11069141|pub.1092016578|43;[]|[]|Oversold and Underused, Computers in the Classroom|2001||||10.4159/9780674030107|pub.1144896359|559"

The World Wide Web, which affords so many educational applications friendly to designers as well as to the users, has lived up to its name by reaching nearly all countries through the internet infrastructure. Online education at first suggests education through the internet, but the “line” in online and offline refers more broadly to networked computers. By necessity in some countries, or by choice, Intranets and other systems of digital devices such as mobile phones, whether connected by ground wires or by satellites, can also serve as media for formal education and informal learning. Issues of access recurring in this chapter imply, however, a goal that all learners at least have the option of studying and communicating with other world citizens through the global internet, that is, online education in the fullest sense.

With 1,000 million people and 180 million households, India is one of the biggest growing economies in the world. With the advent of the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) revolution, India and its villages are slowly but steadily getting connected to the cities of the nation and the world beyond. Owing to the late Rajiv Gandhi, India is now a powerful knowledge economy, and though India may have been slow to start, it certainly has caught up with the West and is ahead in important respects. The Government, the corporate sector, NGOs and educational institutions have supported rural development by encouraging digital libraries, e‐business, e‐learning and e‐governance. The aim of this paper is to touch upon and highlight some of the areas where, by using ICT, the masses have been reached in this way.

Unequal access to Information Technology has produced uneven levels of participation in the networked economy and society. Internet access, which is important to maintaining a technologically competent labour force, is a staple in the developed countries. However, it continues to be limited in Romania. Would-be users are devising inventive solutions to the relatively costly access solutions in order to get on the Information Highway. A country case study of Internet access in Romania reveals the advent of self-established, co-operative networks providing shared Internet access - seemingly a unique and innovative approach. Several of the Internet access plans on the market are presented in this paper together with a discussion of cyber cafés and the home-grown, co-operative networks that seem to be popping up all over the country. Understanding the context within which these home-grown networks arise and prosper offers valuable lessons and ideas for transferring these approaches to other developing countries that, like Romania, are struggling to bridge the infamous digital divide.",Journal of Business Systems Governance & Ethics,2007,2,3,,"Gudea, Sorin",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1067625103,2,

A Critical Review of a Community Informatics Project,"This article examines the effect of a project funded by New Opportunities Funding (NOF) that supports the UK government's policy to establish 700 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) centers in deprived rural and inner city areas based in England. By drawing on evidence from a case study funded by NOF, the paper argues that there remains an underpinning assumption by government that simply by introducing technology to disadvantaged communities, the digital divide will be removed and people will go online. This paper argues that this “top down” approach is limited in its success when it is not grounded in the realities of the day‐to‐day living of individuals and community groups and the social and economic climate in which they are located. Our evidence suggests that simply providing access and support in skills training does not lead individuals and community groups to making effective use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and that further consideration needs to be given as to why people and community groups should go online.",Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,2006,8,3,0-0,"Keeble, Leigh",Teesside University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061923683,10,"[Zuber-Skerritt, Ortrun]|[]|NEW DIRECTIONS IN ACTION RESEARCH|1996||||10.4324/9780203392935|pub.1001108953|33;[Burt, Eleanor; Taylor, John]|[; ]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|1|54-73|10.1080/713768512|pub.1020877992|14;[]|[]|Education + Training|2001|43|2||10.1108/et.2001.00443bad.002|pub.1061040516|2;[McNiff, Jean; Lomax, Pamela; Whitehead, Jack]|[; ; ]||1996||||10.4324/9780203281291|pub.1095909056|237"

The paper highlights various perspectives on the meaning of trust and draws on findings from the Oxford Internet Survey to explore and refine key social determinants of cybertrust. Evidence from this research provides fresh insights into the factors shaping trust in the Internet, arguing that cybertrust, defined as a confident expectation, is influenced by experience, defined operationally by several indicators of proximity to the Internet, in ways shaped by educational background.

On the one hand, the evidence makes it clear that in some places the opportunities offered by Internet voting are being keenly explored. In several countries the foundations for online voting are being put in place, experiments have been carried out or policies are being drafted. On the other hand, critical analyses that warn against fundamental problems of Internet voting have been presented, suggesting that Internet voting is not really a viable option for serious democracies. A number of countries otherwise deeply committed to democratic practices hesitate to pursue online democracy. What can be made of these seemingly contradictory trends? Is there a future for Internet voting? Are the critics right in their claim that online election is a dead-end street?

The results supported the proposition, as they indicated a causal path model that contained a positive indirect relationship of socio-economic background with the amount of current computer use, via computer experience and computer anxiety. Socio-economic background had a direct positive relationship with computer experience and an indirect negative relationship with computer anxiety. The pattern of relationships was held over and above the variance accounted for by the set of control variables that included, among others, computer access and sex. The findings are supportive of the digital divide and they imply that information technology may in fact be increasing inequalities among social strata in their access to employment opportunities.

pub.1093306251,10.1109/ddhh.2006.1624817,Web-Based Personal-Centered Electronic Health Record for Elderly Population,"Increasing acceptance and availability of information and communication technology (ICf‘) have made the development and implementation of web-based electronic personal health records (PHRs) more feasible. Previous studies have demonstrated the PHR's potential to alleviate limitations in traditional healthcare delivery. However, this type of technology-dependent approach inherits the vulnerabilities of exposing the society to its own share of inequality (i.e., “digital divide”). To address these concerns and improve healthcare outcomes, we have developed a web-based patient-centered electronic PHR, named the Personal Health Information Management System (PHIMS), and a community-based resource sharing and support model/strategy. The system has been evaluated at the Everett Housing Authority, which provides housing for low-income families and elderly or disabled populations, and we conducted a feasibility trial with the elderly and disabled residents. The participants were satisfied with the PHIMS system in general. 82% of the surveyed users attempted to share the PHIMS records with their care providers. Both patients and providers were satisfied with the usability of PHIMS.","1st Transdisciplinary Conference on Distributed Diagnosis and Home Healthcare, 2006.

It involves developing the adaptive agent model and architecture for the tool as well as researching its effectiveness for the users. The potential users for this system are not only naïve about computer driven technology but are also inhibited to try one, which is a consequence of digital divide. They have not experienced a technology-driven environment where computer has become just another tool to mechanize the daily lives. In this respect they are disenfranchised and they belong to the segment that falls under Poor America. Naturally, handing over another search system will not bridge the divide or empower the disenfranchised users. In order to help them overcome the inhibition, this tool has to be, at the very least, easy to use. Therefore as part of the solution, an adaptive, agent-driven search system is being developed. The system will adapt and personalize the process of search to support individual goals and social needs.",ACM SIGCAPH Computers and the Physically Handicapped,2003,,75,7-8,"Chatterjee, Mousumi",Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050248115,0,"[Lang, Ken]|[]|Machine Learning Proceedings 1995|1995|||331-339|10.1016/b978-1-55860-377-6.50048-7|pub.1002050789|1041;[Jettmar, Eva; Nass, Clifford]|[ur.016465775675.45; ur.011010152733.35]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Changing our world, changing ourselves - CHI '02|2002|||129-134|10.1145/503376.503400|pub.1004895765|8;[Selker, Ted]|[ur.012567426031.59]|Communications of the ACM|1994|37|7|92-99|10.1145/176789.176799|pub.1007088674|112;[Trumbly, James E.; Arnett, Kirk P.; Johnson, Peter C.]|[ur.012721432166.17; ur.012212062074.25; ]|International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|1994|40|1|63-81|10.1006/ijhc.1994.1004|pub.1050833551|15;[Marchionini, G.; Shneiderman, B.]|[ur.012405116227.61; ur.013052653253.13]|Computer|1988|21|1|70-80|10.1109/2.222119|pub.1061105216|329"

In North America and Western Europe, nearly 70% of citizens use the Internet on a regular basis, whereas in Africa less than 4% do so. Such inequality impacts business and trade, online education and libraries, telemedicine and health resources, and political information and e-government. In response, a group of educators and community leaders in South Africa and the United States have used various information technologies to create a ?global classroom? that connects people in the two countries. University students, high school students, and other citizens communicate via Internet exchanges, video conferencing, and digital photo essays. The project has produced a number of tangible benefits and it has developed a model for reducing inequality in global education, at least for those institutions with the technological resources to participate.

At present, iShakti is deployed across 1000 rural kiosks in India, covering 5000 villages and reaching 1 million people. Further scale up is underway, expected to cover tens of thousands of villages within the next 2 years. iShakti is a 'virtual information and marketing channel', deploying leading-edge technology in a developing-world environment. It allows rich interactions with people in previously 'media-dark' regions, with easy access to high-value community development services coupled with engaging and scalable market and brand development activities. The impact is already being felt - iShakti is giving some of the most deprived and disempowered people more choice and control over their lives, and providing significant independent revenue for the iShakti entrepreneurs. Computational intelligence is both in the design as well as the personalisation and synchronisation algorithms.

Major factors contributing to these changes are demands being placed on teacher training programs in colleges of education, demands placed on teachers and administrators in the nation's schools, demographic shifts, globalization, declining accessibility of resources along with the digital divide, and, most of all, greater demands for accountability of student achievement at all levels of education. The work of the education librarian has become more integrated in the creation and access of knowledge both in the library profession, and education itself. Education librarians not only have close ties to school curriculum being taught but also with the preparation of preservice teachers, students enrolled in advanced graduate studies, and the education researcher.

This is the result of locating previously disadvantaged people in underdeveloped areas. These areas are characterized by a high rate of unemployment and a poor level of education. This results in a scenario where most of the residents are unable to utilize IT resources. Some people in these areas are not informed about the availability and importance of these technologies in the market. Those who are academically fit for accessing these technologies often cannot afford them. High deployment costs associated with broadband services makes it even more challenging to deploy such services in this environment. Approximately 80% of the population in Africa is rural, which alone creates a demand for the coverage of rural regions. In this research it is shown that broadband services can be delivered to rural people by applying xDSL technologies, using the existing telecommunications infrastructure.

We examine two large developing countries, China and India, in an attempt to understand their approaches to developing e-business. While both countries had access to the technology at about the same time, each has taken a different path to utilizing it. These approaches are based on a number of factors, including government initiatives and focus, infrastructure building, experience and understanding of business operations, and culture, among others.

However, low population density makes it difficult for rural areas to support expensive technology investments such as are required for broadband. In addition, history shows rural adoption timelines significantly lag those in urban areas, which slows development of the demand economically necessary to support infrastructure construction.This study examined variables that influenced rural residents’ comparatively early adoption of information technologies at a time when the rural-urban digital divide in the use of basic online services was still growing. The study found employment by a company that was using specific information technologies was the strongest predictor of individual adoption. The effect was particularly strong among those with less formal education. The findings suggest rural development specialists should focus on encouraging locally owned rural businesses to adopt information technologies as a means of maximizing local diffusion and increasing demand levels.",Government Information Quarterly,2003,20,2,135-150,"Hollifield, C.Ann; Donnermeyer, Joseph F",University of Georgia; The Ohio State University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040349281,73,

A national information network now exists yet this infrastructure--largely hardware--needs to be continually modernized and parlayed with commitments to building human capacity, developing relevant content, and scaling socially beneficial technology applications, such as telemedicine, in order to optimize these initial multi-billion-dollar outlays. This article makes the case that sidestepping public-private initiatives aimed at accelerating digital opportunity is imprudent, given the mounting empirical evidence highlighting the payoffs of information and communications technologies, when properly integrated and applied, especially in enhancing the life chances of underserved Americans.

This paper discusses the pedagogical, technological, and business trends that together affect the direction of innovation in virtual education. A discussion is presented on how traditional higher education (campus-based, lecture-bound, and faculty-driven) can benefit from the explosion of opportunities born of technological innovation and development by adopting changes in operational models—both administrative and pedagogical. Also addressed are the scope of services that comprise the engagement of information technology in academic environments necessary to fulfill evolving charters and missions that respond to current trends and future demands of educational innovations in the digital age where education and business—in their operational models and management styles—are moving toward complementary, even comparable strategies.",IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management,2003,50,4,403,"Friedman, Robert S.; Deek, Fadi P.",New Jersey Institute of Technology,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061600104,40,"[Maurer, H.]|[]|The supplemental proceedings of the conference on Integrating technology into computer science education: working group reports and supplemental proceedings  - ITiCSE-WGR '97|1997|||112-113|10.1145/266057.266127|pub.1007210624|1;[Smith, Patricia L.; Dillon, Connie L.]|[ur.013703234141.21; ur.012777172611.68]|American Journal of Distance Education|1999|13|2|6-23|10.1080/08923649909527020|pub.1026520252|59;[Merisotis, Jamie P.; Phipps, Ronald A.]|[ur.01152022670.28; ur.012754257231.13]|Change The Magazine of Higher Learning|1999|31|3|12-17|10.1080/00091389909602685|pub.1027127902|100;[Deek, Fadi P.; Deek, Maura A.; Friedman, Robert S.]|[ur.010212376153.78; ur.013572042542.96; ur.01217707560.75]|Interactive Learning Environments|1999|7|2-3|113-136|10.1076/ilee.7.2.113.7432|pub.1027631672|4;[Arbaugh, J.

The findings, based on a number of concrete case-studies, clearly confirm that, despite of the huge research and developmental effort having been made for advancing ICT applications in education, ICT as a whole is surprisingly lacking a systematic discourse with educational domains, even much less concerning those who have learning difficulties. Whilst well known technical tools such as word-processors, screen-reading software and problem-solving software packages still provide useful “snapshots” of ICT applications from particular points in time, we argue that these pictures now require updating. To enable the ICT development crossing multi-disciplinary boundaries, a meta-synthesis approach is innovated.

A number of moral questions arise from the current state of South-North information flow, six forms of which are analysed in this paper with particular reference to Africa.

It details the deployment of the approach in a pilot study of kiosk-based delivery for health and general Citizens Advice Bureau services. The study showed that the kiosk design appeared to address basic usability and accessibility needs, but the system had architectural problems that seriously impacted on its usability. These problems only came to light when a deeper analysis of clients’ information seeking needs was factored in. This case study demonstrates the need for a multi-perspective approach to evaluation — fit for purpose — to facilitate not only identification but also deep diagnosis of usability problems.

pub.1049896583,10.1016/j.giq.2006.08.004,Making IT work for municipalities: Building municipal wireless networks,"The lack of widely available, affordable broadband Internet access has spurred a movement in which municipalities are rolling out wireless broadband networks. This movement has raised a number of questions including: Why are municipalities acting as the early adopters of wireless broadband technology? How does increased state regulation of municipal broadband networks affect this trend and how can cities respond? As cities use wireless broadband technology to enhance services to citizens, the growth of municipal wireless deployments has transitioned from linear to exponential. In response, many states have passed laws to regulate and restrict cities' ability to own, operate, deploy, or profit from either telecommunications or information services. Current and pending laws will be examined to understand how cities can deploy a wireless broadband network under these regulations. An analysis of municipal facilities and technology expertise illustrates the opportunity for public–private cooperation in wireless deployments. This paper will show that cooperation is beneficial in many cases. Finally, current business models will be examined for their ability to foster cooperation between the public and private sectors, bridge the digital divide, and create competition among private sector providers.",Government Information Quarterly,2006,23,3-4,359-380,"Tapia, Andrea; Maitland, Carleen; Stone, Matt",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049896583,43,"[Lee, Sang M.; Tan, Xin; Trimi, Silvana]|[ur.010605430361.02; ; ur.010664037513.94]|Communications of the ACM|2005|48|10|99-104|10.1145/1089107.1089112|pub.1003732488|225;[Prieger, James]|[ur.014605206564.75]|Telecommunications Policy|1998|22|1|57-71|10.1016/s0308-5961(97)00057-8|pub.1013500272|36;[Sawyer, Steve; Tapia, Andrea; Pesheck, Leonard; Davenport, John]|[ur.016707364277.62; ur.0607300050.25; ; ]|Communications of the ACM|2004|47|3|62-65|10.1145/971617.971647|pub.1024935890|32;[Strover, Sharon; Chapman, Gary; Waters, Jody]|[ur.012341524001.11; ; ]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|7-8|465-485|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.008|pub.1035876282|47;[Sawyer, Steve; Tapia, Andrea]|[ur.016707364277.62; ur.0607300050.25]|International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction|2005|1|3|1-14|10.4018/jthi.2005070101|pub.1041246944|81;[Gillett, Sharon E; Lehr, William H; Osorio, Carlos]|[ur.014205054675.54; ur.016001202377.84; ur.016511016102.36]|Telecommunications Policy|2004|28|7-8|537-558|10.1016/j.telpol.2004.05.001|pub.1046333877|101"
pub.1023680317,10.1016/j.elerap.2006.06.002,Procurement models in the agricultural supply chain: A case study of online coffee auctions in India,"During the past few years, several innovative IT-based applications have emerged around the world that promise to bridge the proverbial “digital divide” by linking growers directly to domestic and international markets through the Internet. Online commodity auctions are an example of such initiatives and have the potential to impact the livelihood of millions around the world. However, an important factor that affects the benefits obtained by growers is the supply chain structure that results from the introduction of the online platform. In this paper, we provide a case study of an online coffee auction established in India for selling various grades of coffee beans. The focus of the case study is on the supply chain structure that is likely to evolve under various product and supplier characteristics. We argue that the online direct selling of commodities by growers is likely to evolve only under a certain set of conditions. We also argue that governments and platform providers can facilitate online direct selling by growers through initiatives that increase the bargaining power of the growers and increase the confidence of the buyer to directly procure from lesser known growers.",Electronic Commerce Research and Applications,2007,6,3,309-321,"Banker, Rajiv D.; Mitra, Sabyasachi",Temple University; Georgia Institute of Technology,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023680317,16,"[Clemons, Eric K.; Reddi, Sashidhar P.; Row, Michael C.]|[ur.013116612231.02; ur.010733022076.29; ur.011231137142.83]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1993|10|2|9-35|10.1080/07421222.1993.11517998|pub.1000533320|613;[Quibria, M.G; Ahmed, Shamsun N; Tschang, Ted; Reyes-Macasaquit, Mari-Len]|[ur.015764721413.10; ur.010654611213.10; ur.012247552213.80; ur.015235454213.44]|Journal of Asian Economics|2003|13|6|811-825|10.1016/s1049-0078(02)00186-0|pub.1000815131|151;[Sarkar, Mitrabarun; Butler, Brian; Steinfield, Charles]|[ur.015372642227.26; ur.015731707377.93; ur.013651017147.33]|Journal of Business Research|1998|41|3|215-221|10.1016/s0148-2963(97)00064-7|pub.1004714039|99;[Mahadevan, B.]|[]|California Management Review|2003|46|1|86-100|10.2307/41166233|pub.1005626503|47;[Lee, Ho Geun; Westland, J.

The members were the Faculty of Computer Science and the Institute for Political Science at the University of Marburg, the local administration of the city of Marburg, the local administration of the county of Marburg-Biedenkopf, the electoral supervisor (Landeswahlleiter) of the state of Hessen (Ministry of the Interior), the commissioner for data protection (Datenschutzbeauftragter) of the state of Hesse, the regional computing centre (KIV) and a local private software company.

With her many problems of hunger, epidemics, war, and other related socio-economic problems, the dzfusion of the Internet and related technologies might be the last thing to be associated with Africa. However, we are experiencing the contrary. Sub-Saharan countries are experiencing tremendous growth in Internet connectivity, the use of computers, and in the dzfusion of wireless communications. Although still at its starting stages, electronic commerce is one of the growth areas for information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Africa. This paper presents a research framework for assessing electronic commerce in Sub-Saharan Africa. It describes the nature of the digital divide, and explains the need for the commercial applications of the Internet in developing countries in general.

This will help bridge the digital divide, as these computer solutions will be closer to the local users. The project entails studying the community in question and understanding their way of life and then develop software solutions that use features that they are familiar with and use their language. The project will ask the community to partake in the development of the solution and then reap benefits from whatever revenue stream the project will enable. An added benefit is that we should be able to preserve the cultural aspects of the community while bringing forth best class modernity. Key areas that the project will affect are: education, music, artworks, written or documented history etc. Younger as well as future generations will have a chance to be inventive, innovative and hopefully become the future developers and develop their own software solutions.",2006 8th International Conference Advanced Communication Technology,2006,3,,2219-2222,"Ndlovu, Gary O.G; Terzoli, Alfredo; Petersen, Alvin; Muyingi, Hippolyte; Rao, G.

For fourteen civil affairs service sites, 51 participants performed usability tests and post-test interviews. The results showed that even though the e-Government services are fairly attainable, it takes too many steps and long time for users to complete the given tasks. The overall success rate to complete the tasks on e-Government was 0.69 and it took more than 4 minutes and 12 page navigations on average to complete simple transactions. A strong digital divide could be observed in the use of e-Government services in that the users with different vocations and ages resulted in difference in perceived usability and actual performance. Results suggest that not only are there wide variations in the usability for the services provided, but that significant work still needs to be undertaken in order to make the services of the e-Government more usable, particularly for the older users.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4556,,64-72,"Lee, Seongil; Cho, Joo Eun",Sungkyunkwan University; Kyungpook National University,South Korea; South Korea,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043127050,11,"[Palmer, Jonathan W.; Griffith, David A.]|[; ur.013441435413.38]|Communications of the ACM|1998|41|3|44-51|10.1145/272287.272296|pub.1020504505|158;[Vassilakis, Costas; Lepouras, George; Haston, Simon; Georgiadis, Panagiotis; Fraser, John]|[ur.012712243705.08; ur.012014454635.68; ur.07402623723.22; ur.011026145307.98; ur.011637350020.04]|e-Service Journal|2004|4|1|41-63|10.1353/esj.2006.0004|pub.1029744378|20;[Jarvenpaa, Sirrka L.; Todd, Peter A.]|[; ]|International Journal of Electronic Commerce|1996|1|2|59-88|10.1080/10864415.1996.11518283|pub.1039856679|980;[Seifert, Jeffrey W.; Relyea, Harold C.]|[; ]|Journal of E-Government|2004|1|1|7-15|10.1300/j399v01n01_02|pub.1064877973|19"

Using the panel data on 50 countries during 1992-2001 periods, this article reviews what is known about the determinants of the ICT expenditure figures and takes it as a proxy measure for the informatization across countries. Models were estimated to explore determinants using a cross-country analysis. Consistent with previous literatures, the results show that per capita income and ICT-related infrastructures were two robust explanators. Moreover, human capital investment significantly contributes to the national informatization in developing world. Openness to foreign trade should also be an important determinant as if the statistical analysis performed in the paper did give any statistical support. Consequently, to be able to take actions to bridge the digital divide or to eradicate information poverty, overall results in the paper can be helpful for policy-makers to establish the promising policies concerning national informatization.",Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies,2007,14,1,125-142,이충기,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000394007,1,

These countries are experiencing tremendous growth in use of computers, Internet connectivity, wireless communications and many other related technologies. However, the same is not true for Africa's Least Developed Countries (LDCs) that are still greatly behind other regions of the world in terms of the level of basic telecommunications infrastructure such as teledensity (number of main telephone lines for every one hundred inhabitants). While it is true that Africa's LDCs have some Internet presence, it seems to be limited only to the urban elite. These countries may therefore not be in the position to exploit most of the benefits the Internet can offer. This study suggests a sound teledensity infrastructure as the precursor to the diffusion of various information and communications technologies.

There are large disparities in this, particularly in underdeveloped rural areas of the world. Information and communication technologies designed to address this disparity must take into account the many barriers in the use of technology that these communities face. We define an ’inclusive technology’ as a technology which overcomes the barriers to using technology inherent within a given community and increases the opportunities available to that community. We propose a conceptual model and a set of heuristic measurements for examining the ’inclusiveness’ of a technology with respect to a given community, and illustrate their use by applying them to two real-world projects. By proposing this model and set of measurements, we hope to achieve a better understanding of’development projects’ and create a systematic process and a framework to assist software engineers in designing and evaluating software based services intended to reduce the Digital Divide.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2007,241,,35-48,"Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.",Concordia University,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1053002316,3,"[Pitula, K.; Radhakrishnan, T.]|[ur.0667446636.89; ur.01214321552.72]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2007|4554||243-252|10.1007/978-3-540-73279-2_28|pub.1029010882|6;[Ramı́rez, Ricardo]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2001|25|5|315-330|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00007-6|pub.1033162644|39;[Brewer, E.; Demmer, M.; Du, B.; Ho, M.; Kam, M.; Nedevschi, S.; Pal, J.; Patra, R.; Surana, S.; Fall, K.]|[ur.0621176610.34; ur.013463377151.21; ur.015672411073.59; ur.011204166163.74; ur.015057310430.44; ur.013327336644.60; ur.010432051166.17; ur.016336613335.90; ur.011033044415.27; ur.07617573671.17]|Computer|2005|38|6|25-38|10.1109/mc.2005.204|pub.1061387336|223;[Cecchini, Simone; Raina, Monica]|[ur.010657704011.01; ur.014626303323.23]|Information Technologies and International Development|2004|2|2|65-75|10.1162/1544752044193434|pub.1063350545|69;[Venkatesh; Morris; Davis; Davis]|[ur.012207572032.74; ur.013005152432.16; ; ]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|3|425|10.2307/30036540|pub.1102515221|16910;[]|[]|Technology and Social Inclusion|2004||||10.7551/mitpress/6699.001.0001|pub.1110624278|450"

This chapter investigates this question, focusing on the role of information and communications technology in promoting indigenous peoples’ development. First, the chapter analyzes key factors under which information and knowledge can be instrumental and substantive for the empowerment of marginalized groups. Hereby, it will be argued that improved informational capabilities, similar to the enhancement of a person’s writing and reading skills, can enhance poor people’s capabilities to make strategic life choices and to achieve the lifestyle they value. The chapter develops an alternative evaluation framework for ICT interventions based on Sen’s capability approach. This framework places, in contrast to the current discourse around the digital divide, the human development of the poor and not technology at the center of the analysis. The chapter concludes that a direct and causal relationship between ICTs and enhanced well-being does not exist, but that in fact this relationship is being shaped by a dynamic, multi-dimensional interrelationship between technology and the social context.",Empowering Marginal Communities with Information Networking,2006,,,124-164,"Rahman, Hakikur; Gigler, Björn-Sören",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1023803476,6,

Many people consider that the Internet is not only access to unlimited information, but also has a potential to make a difference in the development of human rights and democracy. Information and communications technologies, free software, and open source have a big role to play in this context. The importance of access is an issue: one tends to focus mainly on the physical access, which is only a small part in this connection. There are other types of limitations to access: the technology should be appropriate, be affordable, and a political will to provide all citizens with equal possibilities should support the introduction of the technologies. Who has access to these new technologies? Who does not have such access?

The case of the South African manufacturing sector,"Business-to-business electronic commerce has become a priority area for many international development organisations, particularly since concerns about the ‘digital divide’ have put the policymaking spotlight on the connection between ICTs and industrial development policies. This paper aims to explore the current state and likely future direction of B2B e-commerce in the South African manufacturing sector. The empirical research is based on 120 firm-level interviews, and 31 personal interviews with industry experts. The results suggest that B2B e-commerce is in an embryonic stage in the South African manufacturing sector, and technology and market dynamics are still casting its basic shape. The ability to realise efficiency gains in the B2B electronic marketplace will largely hinge on the climate of confidence and trust that businesses are able to create in their relations with their suppliers and customers. We argue that policy decisions will have a major impact on the kind of environment in which e-commerce will develop and should therefore be crafted with due recognition of its fragile and evolving nature.",Information Technology for Development,2003,10,1,25-40,"Moodley, Sagren",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002632355,14,"[Moodley, Sagren]|[ur.016004022510.00]|Development Southern Africa|2002|19|5|659-679|10.1080/03768835022000019347|pub.1007843187|8;[Pavitt, Keith; Patel, Parimal]|[ur.012251713367.77; ur.011773150577.81]|Innovation Policy in a Global Economy|1999|||94-119|10.1017/cbo9780511599088.008|pub.1008284940|87;[Archibugi, Daniele; Michie, Jonathan]|[ur.013603163272.52; ur.01250107260.63]|Futures|1997|29|2|121-137|10.1016/s0016-3287(96)00072-9|pub.1024781025|85;[Porter, Michael]|[]|Competitive Intelligence Review|1990|1|1|14-14|10.1002/cir.3880010112|pub.1041899459|3329;[Habib, Adam; Padayachee, Vishnu]|[; ur.010227340271.10]|World Development|2000|28|2|245-263|10.1016/s0305-750x(99)00130-8|pub.1047361662|120;[Panagariya, Arvind]|[ur.016640120101.95]|World Economy|2000|23|8|959-978|10.1111/1467-9701.00313|pub.1049332587|55;[Graham, A.]|[]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|145-158|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.145|pub.1059967046|32;[Mansell, R.]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Oxford Review of Economic Policy|2001|17|2|282-295|10.1093/oxrep/17.2.282|pub.1059967054|77;[Lucking-Reiley, David; Spulber, Daniel F]|[ur.013065052425.93; ur.013562453163.17]|Journal of Economic Perspectives|2001|15|1|55-68|10.1257/jep.15.1.55|pub.1064530114|198;[]|[]|Cambridge Journal of Economics|1995||||10.1093/oxfordjournals.cje.a035309|pub.1083475772|1364;[Kitson, Michael; Michie, Jonathan]|[; ]|Innovation Policy in a Global Economy|1999|||163-183|10.1017/cbo9780511599088.011|pub.1089393976|6;[Rosenberg, Nathan]|[]||1976||||10.1017/cbo9780511561313|pub.1098679455|1217;[Rosenberg, Nathan]|[]||1994||||10.1017/cbo9780511582554|pub.1098705309|708;[Pohjola, Matti]|[]||2001||||10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199243983.001.0001|pub.1098832966|267;[Siems, Thomas F.]|[]|SSRN Electronic Journal|2001||||10.2139/ssrn.278284|pub.1102199812|3;[Archibugi, Daniele; Howells, Jeremy; Michie, Jonathan]|[]|Innovation Policy in a Global Economy|1999||||10.1017/cbo9780511599088|pub.1109374493|72;[Hanna, Nagy; Guy, Ken; Arnold, Erik]|[; ; ]|World Bank Discussion Papers|1995||||10.1596/0-8213-3216-3|pub.1109730878|36;[]|[]|Veterinary World||12|9||10.14202/vetworld.2019.9|pub.1120984945|679"

Some of them are targeting business, others aim to connect residents, and there are projects which fully include both in their strategy. In this paper we present three successful Dutch cases of municipal broadband access networks that target residents and SOHOs: Kenniswijk, OnsNet Nuenen and Wireless Leiden. For each case, we have taken a thorough look at the following aspects: background, business model, broadband network, e-services, consumers & promotion, problems, success factors and (intermediate) outcomes. Here we describe the main findings of this analysis. As a next step, we illustrate how these cases and the lessons learned from them may be of benefit to the development of broadband infrastructure and e-services in other countries. In particular, we describe how the European FP6 IST project BReATH uses this knowledge to help the New Member States of the European Union, in order to bridge the digital divide that currently exists throughout Europe.",Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Access networks  - AcessNets '06,2006,,,12,"Kramer, R.

Nowadays, some governments provide services through new technologies, such as Internet, BBS, or IC cards. These e-techs will inevitably propel the mutation in org structure, adv process…and so on. From the public administration perspective, obviously, NPM is also a force underpinning the e-governance. In the early 1980s, G. Caiden described that administrative reform came of age. Under the Thatcherism and Reaganism, the core values of government reform are entrepreneurship and competition, and these will be helpful to the formation of E-government. In this paper, some points will be discussed. First, the formation of the society of Information under the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Second, the transformation of public service delivery in e-government context and the approach of New Public Management (NPM), and of course, the issues of equality, such as digital divide, and digital democracy will also be discussed under the context.

pub.1095025356,10.1109/giis.2007.4404162,Wireless Network Architecture for Digital Inclusion in Rural Environments,"Rural environments of developing countries usually lack of the appropriate communications infrastructure, accentuating the geographical isolation of rural communities. A cost-efficient and service-oriented deployment of Informaton and Communications Technologies (ICTs) helps to reduce the so-called “digital divide”, improving the productivity and quality of life of those communities. Mobile communications have settled down a foundation for the development of new and rich network applications which are particularly attractive as digital inclusion tools for rural environments, where they can be deployed with comparative simplicity and reduced cost. In this paper we propose the Rural Ambient Network (RAN), an architecture for wireless networks specially designed for digital inclusion enabling global optimization of resource utilization using the Community Cost metric. This architecture uses a policy-based management framework for the integration of heterogeneous technologies in a common network control space. We also present a RAN prototype which uses mesh networking as a key technology; several scenarios involving policy-based decision-making have been tested on this infrastructure. Our early results show that RAN augments the native routing capabilities of the underlying technologies.",2007 First International Global Information Infrastructure Symposium,2007,,,20-26,"Grampín, Eduardo; Baliosian, Javier; Visca, Jorge; Giachino, Martín; Vidal, Leonardo",University of the Republic,Uruguay,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095025356,2,"[Kappler, Cornelia; Mendes, Paulo; Prehofer, Christian; Pöyhönen, Petteri; Zhou, Di]|[ur.013002342174.74; ur.013601102351.54; ur.010357243342.39; ur.015174602655.75; ur.07642726705.73]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3457||139-151|10.1007/11520184_11|pub.1052189577|25;[Gupta, P.; Kumar, P.R.]|[ur.014075604365.52; ur.07654411041.17]|IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|2000|46|2|388-404|10.1109/18.825799|pub.1061101255|6115"

Training and human resources departments are often among the most adversely affected. Training managers are left with fewer resources with which to fulfil corporate training needs. Continuously having to justify costs and investments in training, they are often asked about the applicability and effectiveness of a particular project. Electronic training, a strategic human resource investment vehicle, is increasingly called into question in this context. But electronic training is expected to become a crucial factor in meeting the challenges of the rapidly changing world economy and enabling organizations to adapt to continuous change. While electronic training poses considerable challenges for organizations, especially in developing countries, it may also represent a unique opportunity to close the digital divide between developed and developing nations and to advance economic development. This paper is based on research conducted in Egypt to investigate the effectiveness and applicability of electronic training in Egyptian organizations and to identify how those organizations assess the role and implementation of electronic training.

pub.1032422432,10.1108/09590550710750322,A commentary on social and experiential (e‐)retailing and (e‐)shopping deserts,"Purpose The last ten years have seen a gradual withdrawal of retail facilities from many local areas and the consequent growth of “shopping deserts” resulting in social and health disbenefits. The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential for e‐shopping to fill the vacuum and to assist disadvantaged shoppers.   Design/methodology/approach The paper uses prior published research to comment on the extent to which e‐retailing may be the shopping solution of the future?   Findings The internet has limited potential to compensate for shopping deserts, as consumers who do not have a good range of physical shops within walking distance also tend to lack access to the internet.   Research limitations/implications The paper is based solely on prior research. The authors recommend action research that may hopefully help excluded shoppers to become more included by addressing the problems of access to e‐shopping.   Practical implications Government, service providers and e‐retailers may consider interventions such as subsidised internet access, training and the provision of e‐cash.

What do we need to do differently/ better/smarter? What haven't we tried because the technology, the money or the will wasn't there in the past, but perhaps is now.The CHI field is more than just technology. We understand that our work can have a profound effect on individuals, families, neighborhoods, corporations, and countries. We know that we can influence education, commerce, healthcare, and government. How can we contribute to bridging the digital divides in developed and developing countries?

We begin with a fairly meticulous description from our ethnographic work to which we'll refer throughout the paper. Though we consider this particular instance, we note that it represents of a wide range of instances from our ethnographic work in homes and businesses over several years in Brazil, Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Korea and India. Our goal in this paper, however, is to change the conversation from discussions of infrastructure and capacity building to considerations of local, lived conditions in actual homes and actual businesses to suggest design alternatives that make effective use of ICTs more amenable to various locales. We offer two design directions especially for high tech corporations: Designing for Locus of Control and Designing for Local Participation. Along the way, we'll argue to re-frame of the current conception of ""digital divide"", putting the burden not on those with limited access, but on limited understanding within the high tech industry.",The Journal of Community Informatics,2005,1,1,,"Salvador, Tony; Sherry, John",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133389984,4,

Drawing on data from case studies, the paper explains that mobile phones may not just help create new jobs and new sources of revenue to the state but can also contribute to economic growth by widening markets, creating better information flow, lowering transaction costs, and becoming substitute for costly transportation that is lacking in rural Africa. On the social front, the paper contends that the mobile phone can help create unique personal identities and status symbols for some users. The technology also facilitates the democratic process as groups can use the enhanced communication tools for political and community action thereby reducing the reliance on conventional and often government controlled media. The paper discusses these and other ways by which mobile phones can influence conditions in Africa to induce changes that promote economic and social development. The paper concludes with suggestions that can strengthen ICT adoption in African countries.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2006,28,1,1-16,"Kyem, Peter A.

pub.1048548239,10.1016/s0065-2458(04)64007-1,Disability and Technology: Building Barriers or Creating Opportunities?,"In this chapter, the authors explore the relationship of technology to disability, and how technology can be both a source of liberation and an agent of exclusion for disabled people. The impact of the ‘digital divide’ on people with specific access needs, is examined and discussed, while the physical, cognitive and environmental factors that can contribute to exclusion as a result of technology design and implementation are examined in some depth. Demographic, moral and economic reasons as to why all those involved in the development of technology should take accessibility seriously are presented, while drivers for inclusive design—legislative, technical and economic—are discussed. A review of accessible and inclusive design practice, and the kinds of support that are available from a wide variety of sources for inclusive design is presented—showing that there are ways to minimize exclusion and to promote access. Finally, in looking towards a world where the true potential of technology to enhance the lives of disabled people can be fully reached, an overview is provided of research and development in supporting inclusive design, along with those challenges that remain to be overcome.",Advances in Computers,2005,64,,283-346,"Gregor, Peter; Sloan, David; Newell, Alan F.",University of Dundee,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048548239,29,"[]|[]|Constructing Accessible Web Sites|2002||||10.1007/978-1-4302-1116-7|pub.1001542224|72;[Arnott, John L.; Newell, Alan F.; Alm, Norman]|[ur.013055144375.85; ur.010243237677.29; ur.014670741732.76]|Communications of the ACM|1992|35|5|46-57|10.1145/129875.129878|pub.1011682705|63;[Alm, Norman; Astell, Arlene; Ellis, Maggie; Dye, Richard; Gowans, Gary; Campbell, Jim]|[ur.014670741732.76; ur.01205735530.81; ur.012236715115.31; ur.015675215005.41; ur.014424362401.06; ur.016017323401.07]|Neuropsychological Rehabilitation|2004|14|1-2|117-134|10.1080/09602010343000147|pub.1018917729|104;[Pieper, M.; Morasch, H.; Piéla, G.]|[ur.07452034627.40; ur.012662004463.82; ur.015052326063.14]|Universal Access and Assistive Technology|2002|||119-130|10.1007/978-1-4471-3719-1_12|pub.1020139062|4;[Urban, Mark]|[]|Constructing Accessible Web Sites|2002|||282-302|10.1007/978-1-4302-1116-7_12|pub.1021093503|2;[Arnott, John; Javed, Muhammad]|[ur.013055144375.85; ]|Augmentative and Alternative Communication|1992|8|3|215-223|10.1080/07434619212331276203|pub.1030968411|31;[Clarkson, John; Keates, Simeon; Coleman, Roger; Lebbon, Cherie]|[]|Inclusive Design, Design for the Whole Population|2003||||10.1007/978-1-4471-0001-0|pub.1033382667|159;[Sloan, David; Gregor, Peter; Rowan, Murray; Booth, Paul]|[; ur.016326000351.41; ; ]|Proceedings on the 2000 conference on Universal Usability  - CUU '00|2000|||96-101|10.1145/355460.355480|pub.1035854102|26;[Inglis, E.

E-voting should first comply with the existing legal and regulatory framework. Moreover, e-voting should be technically implemented in such a way that ensures adequate user requirements. As a result, the aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to identify the set of generic constitutional requirements, which should be met when designing an e-voting system for general elections. This set will lead to the specific (design) principles of a legally acceptable e-voting system. Second, to identify, using the Rational Unified Process, the requirements of an adequately secure e-voting system. These requirements stem from the design principles identified previously. The paper concludes that an e-voting capability should, for the time being, be considered only as a complementary means to the traditional election processes. This is mainly due to the digital divide, to the inherent distrust in the e-voting procedure, as well as to the inadequacy of the existing technological means to meet certain requirements.",Computers & Security,2002,21,6,539-556,"Gritzalis, Dimitris A",Athens University of Economics and Business,Greece,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040996421,83,"[Mercuri, Rebecca]|[ur.016470074133.75]|Communications of the ACM|2000|43|11|176|10.1145/353360.353378|pub.1010501377|5;[Schoenmakers, Berry]|[ur.07426421641.21]|Proceedings of the tenth conference on Computers, freedom and privacy challenging the assumptions - CFP '00|2000|||231-233|10.1145/332186.332288|pub.1014558473|2;[Hoffman, Lance J.; Cranor, Lorrie]|[ur.01143473600.97; ur.012313770727.30]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|69-71|10.1145/357489.357510|pub.1036708056|15;[Mitrou, Lilian; Gritzalis, Dimitris; Katsikas, Sokratis]|[ur.012704012433.34; ur.07351603334.20; ur.01063225555.26]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2002|86||469-480|10.1007/978-0-387-35586-3_37|pub.1038157299|39;[Cramer, Ronald; Franklin, Matthew; Schoenmakers, Berry; Yung, Moti]|[ur.013660213711.14; ur.011667464603.56; ur.012315410054.86; ur.016677435253.49]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1996|1070||72-83|10.1007/3-540-68339-9_7|pub.1041805094|158;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28;[Ikonomopoulos, Spyros; Lambrinoudakis, Costas; Gritzalis, Dimitris; Kokolakis, Spyros; Vassiliou, Kostas]|[ur.015334731013.19; ur.014155022302.27; ur.07351603334.20; ur.016152672323.18; ]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2002|86||507-519|10.1007/978-0-387-35586-3_40|pub.1049483702|14;[Schoenmakers, Berry]|[ur.07426421641.21]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|1999|1666||148-164|10.1007/3-540-48405-1_10|pub.1052579524|280;[Butler, R.; Welch, V.; Engert, D.; Foster, I.; Tuecke, S.; Volmer, J.; Kesselman, C.]|[ur.0635530224.37; ur.016532216777.55; ; ur.0634177304.42; ur.014051011760.45; ; ur.01022504670.00]|Computer|2000|33|12|60-66|10.1109/2.889094|pub.1061106331|186"

Perhaps not unexpectedly, participants in this commemorative event reflected on the rapid development of networking and what we today call the Internet and predicted its ubiquity in everyday life, likening it to electricity. Obviously, however, we are not quite there yet. Recent data from the U.S. Department of Commerce suggest that, despite rapidly increasing rates of computer ownership and Internet access in the United States, there are still many people who have been left out of the information revolution. Researchers found that Internet access is highly correlated with income, education level and race, leading them to conclude: The information ‘haves’ have dramatically outpaced the information ‘have nots’ in their access to electronic services. As a result, the gap between these groups — the digital divide — has grown over time.

A total of 61 subjects (51% female, mean age 19) participated in the research sessions. Participants completed the CEW fluency scale [Bunz, U. (2004). The computer-email-web (CEW) fluency scale – Development and validation. International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, 17(4), 477–504.], the computer anxiety ratings scale [Heinssen, R. K., Glass, C. R., & Knight L. A. (1987). Assessing computer anxiety: Development and validation of the computer anxiety rating scale. Computers in Human Behavior, 3, 49–59.], and an applied protocol developed for this study. Results show that the less computer anxiety subjects reported, the higher they perceived their CEW fluency to be (p=.001), but there was no significant relationship between computer anxiety and actual fluency (p=.12). There was no gender difference as to actual CEW fluency (p=.11), but women perceived their fluency lower than did men (p=.012). Overall results validate the robustness of the CEW fluency scale, help identify CEW fluency as a digital divide component, and underscore the importance of initiatives to raise women’s technological self-confidence.",Computers in Human Behavior,2007,23,5,2321-2344,"Bunz, Ulla;

Among the antecedents considered are attitudes about the Internet and their ability to predict Internet use. Participants in the project were 117 adults who completed attitude measures at pre-trial, 3 months, 9 months and post-trial (16 months) and had their Internet use automatically recorded. Ethnographic accounts of their experiences with the Internet were also obtained. Findings indicate that attitudes about privacy and reliability of information on the Internet predict Internet use, but not as expected. Participants who believed less in privacy and reliability of information used the Internet more, even after the contributions of demographic characteristics (race and age), pre-trial experience using the Internet, and actual Internet use during the preceding time period were considered. Attitudes about the potential harm to children and health from Internet use predicted less use. Implications for efforts to reduce the digital divide, the importance of gathering both quantitative and qualitative data, and directions for future research are discussed.",International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,2003,59,3,355-382,"Jackson, Linda A.; von Eye, Alexander; Barbatsis, Gretchen; Biocca, Frank; Zhao, Yong; Fitzgerald, Hiram E.",Michigan State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1006879595,34,"[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Springer Series in Social Psychology|1985|||11-39|10.1007/978-3-642-69746-3_2|pub.1019346517|9584;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1991|50|2|179-211|10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t|pub.1028082114|44217;[Wicker, Allan W.]|[ur.014424031753.11]|Journal of Social Issues|1969|25|4|41-78|10.1111/j.1540-4560.1969.tb00619.x|pub.1031460353|1499;[Steiger, James H.]|[]|Multivariate Behavioral Research|1990|25|2|173-180|10.1207/s15327906mbr2502_4|pub.1042444076|5037;[Kraut, Robert; Patterson, Michael; Lundmark, Vicki; Kiesler, Sara; Mukopadhyay, Tridas; Scherlis, William]|[ur.01065212052.21; ur.01166444620.99; ur.01234560020.49; ur.01345706760.32; ; ur.010534440251.33]|American Psychologist|1998|53|9|1017-1031|10.1037/0003-066x.53.9.1017|pub.1051620085|2796;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.012265731146.27; ur.012777630633.16]|Science|1998|280|5362|390-391|10.1126/science.280.5362.390|pub.1062560768|278;[]|[]|Choice|1993|30|11|30-6433-30-6433|10.5860/choice.30-6433|pub.1073318708|2094"
pub.1042579834,10.1162/rest.88.2.336,The Impact of Internet Subsidies in Public Schools,"In an effort to alleviate the perceived growth of a digital divide, the U.S. government enacted a major subsidy for Internet and communications investment in schools starting in 1998. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of the subsidyknown as the E-Rateon Internet investment in California public schools. The program subsidized spending by 20%90%, depending on school characteristics. Using new data on school technology usage in every school in California from 1996 to 2000 as well as application data from the E-Rate program, the results indicate that the subsidy did succeed in significantly increasing Internet investment. The implied first-dollar price elasticity of demand for Internet investment is between 0.4 and 1.1 and the greatest sensitivity is seen among urban schools and schools with large black and Hispanic student populations. Rural and predominantly white and Asian schools show much less sensitivity. Overall, by the final year of the sample, there were approximately 68% more Internet-connected classrooms per teacher than there would have been without the subsidy. Using a variety of test score results, however, we do not find significant effects of the E-Rate program, at least so far, on student performance.",The Review of Economics and Statistics,2006,88,2,336-347,"Goolsbee, Austan; Guryan, Jonathan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042579834,143,"[Angrist, Joshua; Lavy, Victor]|[ur.01204521414.55; ur.01067370365.51]|The Economic Journal|2002|112|482|735-765|10.1111/1468-0297.00068|pub.1008097573|226;[Krueger, A.

pub.1030465250,10.1016/j.telpol.2007.04.001,The digital vicious cycle: Links between social disadvantage and digital exclusion in rural areas,"The Internet confers benefits on its users in a variety of ways, ranging from simple information acquisition and purchasing goods and services, to interacting with a range of individuals and groups in the wider processes of governance. Rural citizens stand to gain more than most, relatively, since the use of the Internet reduces, if not removes, former barriers (particularly that of distance) to such interaction. To that extent, the shrinking of the ‘digital divide’ (and particularly the increased availability of broadband Internet in the countryside) is very welcome. However, there is a danger that non-users of the Internet are disenfranchised by such developments, and these include some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of rural populations. There is thus a risk that, as the Internet increasingly becomes regarded as the default communication medium, a minority becomes progressively disadvantaged, first in relative and then in absolute terms. This paper explores the links between digital exclusion and social exclusion in a rural context, to identify the likely consequences of this ‘digital vicious cycle’, and to consider the options for ameliorating these consequences.",Telecommunications Policy,2007,31,6-7,374-388,"Warren, Martyn",University of Plymouth,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030465250,174,"[Gant, Robert; Walford, Nigel]|[ur.0666732025.41; ur.015514430275.81]|Health & Place|1998|4|3|245-263|10.1016/s1353-8292(98)00019-7|pub.1014874474|6;[Hindman, Douglas Blanks]|[ur.012531241453.88]|Journalism & Mass Communication Quarterly|2000|77|3|549-560|10.1177/107769900007700306|pub.1016275694|105;[Katzman, Natan]|[ur.012116706704.98]|Journal of Communication|1974|24|4|47-58|10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00407.x|pub.1018315288|51;[Andrew, T.N; Petkov, D]|[ur.015530530471.64; ur.015206107606.04]|Telecommunications Policy|2003|27|1-2|75-93|10.1016/s0308-5961(02)00095-2|pub.1020541468|32;[Grubesic, Tony H.]|[ur.01102232364.97]|The Annals of Regional Science|2003|37|2|263-289|10.1007/s001680300123|pub.1022377026|54;[]|[]||2005||||10.4324/9780203974124|pub.1023117785|123;[Ettema, James S.]|[ur.010342447136.39]|Journal of Broadcasting|1984|28|4|383-395|10.1080/08838158409386548|pub.1024190079|40;[Van Winden, Willem]|[ur.012610151647.28]|Regional Studies|2001|35|9|861-877|10.1080/00343400120090275|pub.1024239978|41;[Anderson, Ben; Tracey, Karina]|[ur.01310332460.24; ]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||139-163|10.1002/9780470774298.ch4|pub.1024582768|78;[Mills, Bradford F.; Whitacre, Brian E.]|[ur.014170025161.80; ur.0576564754.20]|Growth and Change|2003|34|2|219-243|10.1111/1468-2257.00215|pub.1025842918|91;[Grubesic, Tony H.; Murray, Alan T.]|[ur.01102232364.97; ur.011335074125.33]|Papers of the Regional Science Association|2005|81|2|197-221|10.1111/j.1435-5597.2002.tb01230.x|pub.1028500885|35;[Malecki, Edward J]|[ur.016304164460.13]|Journal of Rural Studies|2003|19|2|201-214|10.1016/s0743-0167(02)00068-2|pub.1030500943|211;[Ramı́rez, Ricardo]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|2001|25|5|315-330|10.1016/s0308-5961(01)00007-6|pub.1033162644|39;[Katz, James E.; Rice, Ronald E.]|[; ]|The Internet in Everyday Life|2002|||114-138|10.1002/9780470774298.ch3|pub.1035480136|41;[Ettema, James S.; Kline, F.

Three analytic keys will be used to approach this question. Initially, we will define the concept of electronic governance and its relation with the provision and the costs of information for civil society and the concept of governance. After that, under the framework of the Brazilian context, we will discuss the expansion of the Internet in opposition to the issue of digital divide, focusing on the costs of obtaining information by asymmetrically empowered groups. Finally, in a case study, we will provide a critical analysis of a regional agency, responsible for the implementation of the experience of e-government on the Rio de Janeiro State, considered here as a proxy of the Brazilian case. We expect, as a result of this approach, both a ""map"" of the state of the affairs of this question and its related issues, as well as, the establishment of analytic parameters on what would be a good electronic government.

pub.1034280537,10.1002/meet.14504201201,Are library and information science journals becoming more internationalized? — A longitudinal study of authors' geographical affiliations in 20 LIS journals from 1981 to 2003,"This paper examines journal publications in the field of library and information science (LIS) to assess the level of internationalization in their publications authorship pattern. The international production and communication of scholarly knowledge is crucial to the growth of a discipline. Recent advancement in communication technology and the rise of globalization have led to the hope of a more balanced flow of scientific knowledge. Nevertheless, scholars also cautioned the possibility of a global digital divide and a widening knowledge gap. This study analyzed the geographical affiliations of authors in 20 international LIS journals to track the longitudinal changes in LIS authorship pattern. Findings suggest an increase in the internationalization of LIS authorships over the years. However, the LIS authorship distribution was still highly uneven in 2003 (Gini coefficient = 0.95). Economic power is still found to be a moderate predictor of publication performance. The findings of this study suggest that, at the moment of the writing, there is still room for the LIS field to be more internationalized. Further research is needed to identify the barriers in international scholarly communication and to explore the implications of such a communication pattern on scientific development and global equality.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2006,42,1,n/a-n/a,"Sin, Sei‐Ching Joanna",University of Wisconsin–Madison,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034280537,9,"[Koehler, Wallace]|[ur.011237427613.47]|Scientometrics|2001|51|1|117-132|10.1023/a:1010516712215|pub.1002932118|35;[Zitt, M.; Bassecoulard, E.]|[ur.014721230657.52; ur.013555556563.93]|Scientometrics|1998|41|1-2|255-271|10.1007/bf02457982|pub.1006894695|54;[Zitt, Michel; Perrot, François; Barré, Rémi]|[ur.014721230657.52; ; ur.012774260331.71]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1998|49|1|30-42|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1998)49:1<30::aid-asi5>3.0.co;2-3|pub.1008086162|37;[Frame, J.

The rapid growth of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and proliferation of personal computers increased our productivity, brought to life new business models, created armies of virtual millionaires and real losers, and reduced the World to a size of the global village. Today a person in Central Africa is capable of accessing the same information, use the same e-commerce vendors, and trade on-line as a person in the United States. This enormous progress still leaves most people on Earth including most of the populations of developed countries deprived of access to information that could greatly improve their lives. It is the well known today ""Digital Divide"" phenomenon. To include most of the mankind into the new economy we must address the specificity of consumer, mass market information networking. We present examples of mass market information access services as well as home networking applications and home information infrastructure management schemes. We offer a view on the consumer communications value chain composition that insures user-friendly mechanism for provisioning, service creation, and support of the home networking environments as well as their integration into the information infrastructure.",Proceedings 15th International Conference on Information Networking,2001,,,10-11,"Gelman, A.D.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093961557,0,
pub.1052463847,10.1017/cbo9780511510595.010,Ecological Panel Inference from Repeated Cross Sections,"ABSTRACT This chapter presents a Markov chain model for the estimation of individual-level binary transitions from a time series of independent repeated cross-sectional (RCS) samples. Although RCS samples lack direct information on individual turnover, it is demonstrated here that it is possible with these data to draw meaningful conclusions on individual state-to-state transitions. We discuss estimation and inference using maximum likelihood, parametric bootstrap, and Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches. The model is illustrated by an application to the rise in ownership of computers in Dutch households since 1986, using a 13-wave annual panel data set. These data encompass more information than we need to estimate the model, and this additional information allows us to assess the validity of the parameter estimates. We examine the determinants of the transitions from have-not to have (and back again) using well-known socioeconomic and demographic covariates of the digital divide. Parametric bootstrap and Bayesian simulation are used to evaluate the accuracy and the precision of the ML estimates, and the results are also compared with those of a first-order dynamic panel model. To mimic genuine repeated cross-sectional data, we additionally analyze samples of independent observations randomly drawn from the panel. Software implementing the model is available.",Ecological Inference,2004,,,188-206,"Pelzer, Ben; Eisinga, Rob; Franses, Philip Hans",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052463847,2,
pub.1044665050,10.1080/01972240601057254,ICT Inclusion and Gender: Tensions in Narratives of Network Engineer Training,"Government, major information and communications technology (ICT) companies, and educational institutions in the United Kingdom currently claim that ICT skills training offers inclusion into the new economy. We focus on a private–public training initiative and its impact on the socially excluded, specifically lone women parents. Narrative data from four United Kingdom educational sites participating in this computer network engineer training program highlight a systemic paradox: that ICT skills development initiatives designed to support lone women parents are simultaneously working in opposition to broader policy goals such as work–life balance and ironically serve to reproduce the participants' classification as socially excluded. The assumptions underpinning the model of social inclusion driving the ICT skills training course are analyzed critically using the concepts of community of practice, classificatory systems, and marginalization. Our findings suggest that ICT training courses and initiatives should be accompanied by changes in pedagogic practice that accommodate the more wide-ranging needs of those targeted for inclusion, as well as changes in employment settings. We conclude by exploring the implications of this for government policy formation, business vendor qualifications, the design of ICT skills training initiatives, and our understanding of the role of ICT skills in overcoming the digital divide.",The Information Society,2007,23,1,19-37,"Gillard, Hazel; Mitev, Nathalie; Scott, Susan",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1044665050,16,"[Woodfield, Ruth]|[ur.013732361377.10]|Information Technology and People|2002|15|2|119-138|10.1108/09593840210430561|pub.1001078003|47;[Kvasny, Lynette; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.07421642022.90]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|110||273-291|10.1007/978-0-387-35634-1_14|pub.1001667144|19;[Ahuja, M K]|[ur.016641162325.57]|European Journal of Information Systems|2002|11|1|20-34|10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000417|pub.1002600746|244;[Strover, Sharon]|[ur.012341524001.11]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|275-277|10.1080/01972240309481|pub.1004177104|41;[Adam, Alison; Howcroft, Debra; Richardson, Helen]|[ur.014361323573.45; ur.016605367631.14; ur.015754264573.16]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||333-352|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_22|pub.1006872275|17;[Herring, Susan C.]|[]|The Information Society|1999|15|3|151-167|10.1080/019722499128466|pub.1007746674|140;[Taylor-Gooby, Peter]|[ur.0777003163.46]|Journal of European Social Policy|1991|1|2|93-105|10.1177/095892879100100202|pub.1008284535|98;[]|[]|Work-Life Balance in the 21st Century|2005||||10.1057/9780230373594|pub.1016282864|34;[Wilson, Melanie]|[]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2001|66||353-365|10.1007/978-0-387-35489-7_23|pub.1018398755|2;[Wilhelm, Anthony G.]|[]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|279-286|10.1080/01972240309482|pub.1025361280|11;[Milbourne, Linda]|[]|International Journal of Inclusive Education|2002|6|4|325-343|10.1080/13603110210148621|pub.1026070139|15;[Houston, Diane M.]|[]|Future of Work|2005|||1-10|10.1057/9780230373594_1|pub.1027975076|8;[Mishra, Ramesh]|[]|Social Policy and Administration|1998|32|5|481-500|10.1111/1467-9515.00110|pub.1028339873|31;[Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.07421642022.90]|Information Technology and People|2002|15|2|98-118|10.1108/09593840210430552|pub.1031754111|191;[Wilhelm, Anthony]|[]|The Information Society|2002|18|5|415-416|10.1080/01972240290108212|pub.1033341892|7;[Wilson, Melanie]|[]|Information Technology and People|2002|15|2|139-158|10.1108/09593840210430570|pub.1036465033|46;[Robertson, Maxine; Newell, Sue; Swan, Jacky; Mathiassen, Lars; Bjerknes, Gro]|[ur.012656613513.36; ur.010643725351.91; ur.014427207751.43; ur.01206570775.33; ur.011570131305.55]|Information Systems Journal|2001|11|2|111-126|10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00098.x|pub.1037188029|39;[O'Neil, Dara V.; Baker, Paul M.

While the use of cellular technologies can cut down on the time to deploy access networks, the cost economics make this non-viable in growing telecom economies. In the Digital Gangetic Plains (DGP) project, we are exploring the use of 802.11 as a long-distance access technology. 802.11 is currently cost-priced due to competitive mass production and hence is attractive for low cost and rapid deployment in rural areas.We have built an extensive testbed in a rural setting consisting of multi-hop directional 802.11 links, the testbed spanning up to 80km at its longest. To our knowledge such a long-distance, multi-hop testbed based on 802.11 is unique thus far. While 802.11 is attractive in terms of cost economics, it was inherently designed for indoor use. Our novel use of the technology for outdoor, long-distance access links presents several challenges. Our experience with the testbed has brought several research as well as operational issues to the fore. In this paper, we describe the novel technical challenges that lie ahead in using 802.11 to bridge the digital divide.",ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review,2004,34,1,33-38,"Bhagwat, Pravin; Raman, Bhaskaran; Sanghi, Dheeraj",Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049315576,85,

Legal theory is clearly affected by these changes. Yet there is no rush to publish on e-government in leading legal theory journals, and there is no visible surge in student demand for courses in e-government. Just as only some areas of governments in developed states have taken advantage of new information communication technologies, so only some areas of legal theory have engaged e-government. Issues in Internet governance and personal privacy dominate legal theory’s engagement with e-government, while e-engagement of citizens plays an increasingly important yet still limited role in governments’ interaction with citizens. Yet there are signs that this gentle pace may soon change, as leading jurisdictions approach completion of the first wave of service transformation at the same time as concerns regarding a digital divide recede under the growth of access to new information communication technologies. New opportunities for e-government may soon make e-government’s progress revolutionary rather than evolutionary, and legal theory will be forced to keep pace.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,495-500,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Culver, K.",University of New Brunswick,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1035011949,0,

pub.1061600178,10.1109/tem.2005.844464,Drivers of E-Business Activity in Developed and Emerging Markets,"This paper presents the results of an empirical analysis of the determinants of e-business activity across a sample of 26 developed countries and 52 emerging markets. Several “e-readiness” indicators predict actual e-business activity, including Internet infrastructure, computer infrastructure, affordable telephone service, literacy rates, English language capabilities, and logistics infrastructure. No support was found for a linkage between e-business and institutional factors (i.e., country risk, economic freedom, and transparency) or payment infrastructure. Moreover, evidence of path dependence suggests that sustainable first-mover advantages are conveyed upon early adopters of Internet technologies. Important regional differences also exist, with Asia leading other emerging markets and Eastern Europe lagging. Finally, analysis of a subsample of countries suggests that entrepreneurship rates drive e-business activity. The results document the persistence of the global digital divide and support a broad view of e-readiness, whereby a country's e-business activity depends not only upon information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure but also upon human capital and logistics infrastructure.

As a first step to this goal, we examined the aging effect and sexual difference on the dynamical properties of pointing movements on a touch-screen. The major results are as follows: 1. Pitts' law (MT=α log_2 D/S+β) did not necessarily hold when the subjects repeated pointing movements between two targets locations on the screen (D is the distance between the targets, S is the size of the target). Rather, the increase in the movement time (MT) was linearly related to the the index of difficulty (ID=D/S), this is, MT=α D/S+β. 2. Coefficient α and intercept β were not significantly different between the movements in left-right direction and in depth direction. 3. No sexual difference was found in the magnitude of α and β. 4. The intercept β linearly correlated to the subjects' ages while the coefficient α took almost the same value irrespective of the ages.",The proceedings of the JSME annual meeting,2005,2005.4,0,349-350,"雅信, 駒崎; 正徳, 出澤",University of Electro-Communications,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091062511,0,

Design/methodology/approach An open‐ended e‐mail survey and personal interviews conducted in 2000‐2001 with union leaders provides the primary original data for this research. Responses are content analysed to assess the importance leaders assign to ICT for unions, to review the ways in which ICT is used, and the costs and benefits associated with ICT use. Charts and verbatim quotes are used to summarise respondents’ views. These views are compared and contrasted with data from the USA.   Findings Union leaders were generally enthusiastic about the importance of ICT for unions, citing various examples of ICT‐based benefits to their unions. Some, however, expressed reservations about members’ access to ICT and potential “digital divides”, while others warned that ICT may encourage unions to neglect worker desires for “a human touch” in helping them resolve problems. British union leaders’ views generally reinforce findings from an earlier survey in the USA, although direct comparisons are limited.

This might seem strange, given that the original sponsor of the event, the Society for Social Studies of Science, is an international, professional association whose members are often thought to advocate various forms of social constructivism. The conference brought together active scholars, who do research on global and national ICT issues, with policy makers, program managers, and senior organizational leaders. One of the constants throughout the three days of the meeting is not any particular theoretical, organizational, or ideological advocacy, but an overarching sense that the past, present, and future of research in an information society must include not only innovations in information technologies themselves, but also the ways in which these technologies interact with and are constituted by the social, political, and developmental contexts in which they are embedded.

pub.1016105252,10.1016/j.cpc.2007.02.002,Networking for High Energy and Nuclear Physics,"This report gives an overview of the status and outlook for the world's research networks and major international links used by the high energy physics and other scientific communities, network technology advances on which our community depends and in which we have an increasingly important role, and the problem of the Digital Divide, which is a primary focus of ICFA's Standing Committee on Inter-regional Connectivity (SCIC).Wide area networks of sufficient, and rapidly increasing end-to-end capability are vital for every phase of high energy physicists' work. Our bandwidth usage, and the typical capacity of the major national backbones and intercontinental links used by our field have progressed by a factor of more than 1000 over the past decade, and the outlook is for a similar increase over the next decade. This striking exponential growth trend, outstripping the growth rates in other areas of information technology, has continued in the past year, with many of the major national, continental and transoceanic networks supporting research and education progressing from a 10 Gigabits/sec (Gbps) backbone to multiple 10 Gbps links in their core. This is complemented by the use of point-to-point “light paths” to support the most demanding applications, including high energy physics, in a growing list of cases.As we approach the era of LHC physics, the growing need to access and transport Terabyte-scale and later 10 to 100 Terabyte datasets among more than 100 “Tier1” and “Tier2” centers at universities and laboratories spread throughout the world has brought the key role of networks, and the ongoing need for their development, sharply into focus. Bandwidth itself on an increasing scale is not enough. Realizing the scientific wealth of the LHC and our other major scientific programs depends crucially on our ability to use the bandwidth efficiently and reliably, with reliable high rates of data throughput, and effectively, where many parallel large-scale data transfers serving the community complete with high probability, often while coexisting with many other streams of network traffic. Responding to these needs, and to the scientific mission, physicists working with network engineers and computer scientists have made substantial progress in the development of protocols and systems that promise to meet these needs, placing our community among the world leaders in the development as well as use of large-scale networks. A great deal of work remains, and is continuing.As we advance in these areas, often (as in the past year) with great rapidity, there is a growing danger that we will leave behind our collaborators in regions with less-developed networks, or with regulatory frameworks or business models that put the required networks financially out of reach. This threatens to further open the Digital Divide that already exists among the regions of the world. In 2002, the SCIC recognized the threat that this Divide represents to our global scientific collaborations, and since that time has worked assiduously to reduce or eliminate it; both within our community, and more broadly in the world research community of which HEP is a part.",Computer Physics Communications,2007,177,1-2,224-230,"Newman, Harvey B.",California Institute of Technology,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1016105252,1,

The “digital gap” between developed countries (DC) and less developed countries (LDC) is greater than the gap in the “standard of living” between them.

The interactions are potentially complex ones. The growth of e-government initiatives can have major impacts on how governments function and government policies can strongly influence the development and implementation of information technologies. The significance of these interactions is reflected in the World Bank's recently announced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructure and E-Readiness Assessments Initiative, which will support assessments of countries readiness for electronic business and government. It is also reflected in US and EU sponsored research programs on digital government. These papers respond to the need for research in this area by focusing on a variety of IT developments as they relate to government programs and policy issues. These include such issues as intellectual property rights, security for government systems, the digital divide and problems of limited infrastructure and resources for both citizens and government agencies, as well as the role of government in IT research and development.

The desk research covered the period 1997 to 2001, and covered a number of major countries, including Canada, USA, Member States of the European Union, South Africa, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. The UK was not included in the survey. The targets set by Government are often vague, and few governments seem to have addressed in any thoughtful manner the problems citizens might have with use of technology. An approach along the lines of ‘this is bound to happen’ rather than ‘what sort of society do we really want?’ is a common feature amongst all the approaches examined. The risks of enhancing the digital divide are also rarely explicitly addressed. Comments regarding good initiatives that offer models for other countries to adopt are made. The emergence of government portals is without doubt the most significant development. These provide the facility for personalization by the user. The New Zealand Government’s efforts to ensure that its web sites are useful for citizens who have difficulty spelling and the Canadian Government’s use of minority languages are also noteworthy. The leading countries are Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada. The Australian Government’s e-procurement strategy is a role model for the future.",Journal of Information Science,2002,28,3,173-186,"Muir, Adrienne; Oppenheim, Charles",Loughborough University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1063750862,55,"[Shuler, John A.; Shuler, John A.]|[; ]|The Journal of Academic Librarianship|2001|27|3|224-228|10.1016/s0099-1333(01)00210-5|pub.1004424377|1;[Fletcher, Patricia D.; Westerback, Lisa K.]|[ur.010430134566.29; ur.012741144507.70]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1999|50|4|299-304|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(1999)50:4<299::aid-asi7>3.0.co;2-f|pub.1013880872|6;[McMullen, Susan]|[ur.011753332011.39]|Government Information Quarterly|2000|27|5|581-593|10.1016/s1352-0237(00)00206-9|pub.1019958746|7;[Sprehe, J.

pub.1010299913,10.1108/09593840410570267,On the emancipatory role of rural information systems,"The use of information technology in rural and underserved settings is receiving increasing attention because of the immense potential it brings for improving the quality of life and reducing the digital divide. However, high costs coupled with infrastructure and context‐related inhibitors tend to dilute the advantages that are often taken as a set of givens. In this paper we present a case study of a pioneering experience of information system use in a set of villages in southern India. The research proposition for this study is that social processes can form a viable basis for providing sustainability to information communications technology (ICT) initiatives in rural regions. Theoretical support for this study comes from Habermas’ theory of communicative action. Given that such information systems are emancipatory in nature, and given that such information systems face many obstacles, the value added by these systems needs to be assessed in terms of their contribution to social capital in addition to economic value added. Our analysis reveals that social processes can be leveraged to accord viability to ICT setups in rural settings. Many social changes, that may have faced resistance or were unexpected, themselves became the reason for keeping the ICT setup. This is so because these changes form the basis of empowerment and a participatory framework that would have been absent earlier. We provide implications for researchers as well as practitioners.",Information Technology and People,2004,17,4,407-422,"Kanungo, Shivraj",George Washington University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010299913,58,"[Hirschheim, Rudy; Klein, Heinz K.]|[ur.07550242121.68; ur.012120760240.46]|Communications of the ACM|1989|32|10|1199-1216|10.1145/67933.67937|pub.1008828515|458;[Cecchini, Simone; Scott, Christopher]|[ur.010657704011.01; ]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|2|73-84|10.1002/itdj.1590100203|pub.1022170550|213;[Kvasny, Lynette; Truex, Duane]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013072777061.80]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2000|41||277-293|10.1007/978-0-387-35505-4_17|pub.1029343048|21;[Hirschheim, Rudy; Klein, Heinz K.; Lyytinen, Kalle]|[ur.07550242121.68; ur.012120760240.46; ur.015577330504.48]|Accounting Management and Information Technologies|1996|6|1-2|1-64|10.1016/0959-8022(96)00004-5|pub.1054565662|157;[Gregory, Wendy J.; Romm, Norma R.

pub.1045182743,10.1145/1063786.1063791,Bridging the digital divide: storage media + postal network = generic high-bandwidth communication,"Making high-bandwidth Internet access pervasively available to a large worldwide audience is a difficult challenge, especially in many developing regions. As we wait for the uncertain takeoff of technologies that promise to improve the situation, we propose to explore an approach that is potentially more easily realizable: the use of digital storage media transported by the postal system as a general digital communication mechanism. We shall call such a system a Postmanet . Compared to more conventional wide-area connectivity options, the Postmanet has several important advantages, including wide global reach, great bandwidth potential, low cost, and ease of incremental adoption. While the idea of sending digital content via the postal system is not a new one, none of the existing attempts have turned the postal system into a generic and transparent communication channel that not only can cater to a wide array of applications, but also effectively manage the many idiosyncrasies associated with using the postal system. In the proposed Postmanet, we see two recurring themes at many different levels of the system. One is the simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and the postal system so we can combine their latency and bandwidth advantages. The other is the exploitation of the abundant capacity and bandwidth of the Postmanet to improve its latency, cost, and reliability.",ACM Transactions on Storage,2005,1,2,246-275,"Garg, Nitin; Sobti, Sumeet; Lai, Junwen; Zheng, Fengzhou; Li, Kai; Wang, Randolph Y.; Krishnamurthy, Arvind",Princeton University; Yale University,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045182743,9,"[Kaashoek, M.

pub.1040039726,10.1300/j186v04n02_01,Health Information @Preuss (HIP),"As the digital divide continues to narrow, young people from various socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnic groups are routinely searching for health information online; and it appears they are doing so from both their schools and their homes. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that in the fall of 2000, 98% of public schools were connected to the Internet (1). A national Internet-use survey among young people conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation (these young people also reported that they were from “lower” or “working class” backgrounds), indicated that 63% of the respondents had Internet access at home (2). A significant segment of these respondents specified further that one of the subjects they regularly explore online is health information. Currently, though, online health information is a vast and varied landscape comprised of exhilarating peaks and dangerous valleys; and there are those who believe that this uneven situation poses a risk for young online health information seekers. With that in mind, and knowing that young people will continue to search for health information via the Internet, the University of California, San Diego Medical Center Library and The Preuss School UCSD created a program to integrate health information and health information literacy skills into the curricula of the school and thereby mitigate the retrieval of questionable and potentially dangerous health information by students.",Journal of Hospital Librarianship,2004,4,2,1-18,"Haynes, Craig","University of California, San Diego",United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040039726,3,"[Gustafson, David H; Hawkins, Robert P; Boberg, Eric W; McTavish, Fiona; Owens, Betta; Wise, Meg; Berhe, Haile; Pingree, Suzanne]|[ur.0726505407.18; ur.01170123373.77; ur.01206672504.61; ur.01043713401.55; ur.01323660556.15; ur.01114150675.46; ur.01162264075.45; ur.010715067003.15]|International Journal of Medical Informatics|2002|65|3|169-177|10.1016/s1386-5056(02)00048-5|pub.1006547166|188;[Borzekowski, D L; Rickert, V I]|[ur.01035376765.16; ur.0775007217.40]|JAMA Pediatrics|2001|155|7|813-817|10.1001/archpedi.155.7.813|pub.1019406948|269;[Eysenbach, Gunther; Powell, John; Kuss, Oliver; Sa, Eun-Ryoung]|[ur.015744165545.08; ur.0767425235.33; ; ur.01266040067.68]|JAMA|2002|287|20|2691-2700|10.1001/jama.287.20.2691|pub.1020024069|1360"

There are changes to the fundamental mechanisms of public governance including roles of citizens, organisations and government. This study explores the views, roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in promoting eGovernance, with a focus on countries that are in the early stages of developing their ICT strategies.   Design/methodology/approach An exploratory case study approach is used based on the Malaysian experience. A combination of interviews and comments from questionnaires are used to examine government and citizens' viewpoints concerning eGovernment development.   Findings While these are preliminary, the qualitative findings are intended for reflection, as well as, suggestions for action. They include: creating eCitizen partnerships; narrowing the digital divide; finding consensus on structures and roles in an eGovernment strategy. The discussion calls for collective stakeholder involvement of government and citizens as partners in order to promote social inclusion.   Research limitations/implications The study is exploratory and the findings cannot be considered as representative. However, they indicate areas for improvement. A second more robust empirical study is envisaged with more emphasis on application of stakeholder theory and techniques.

The idea is to select, organize, index and distribute useful educational Web contents to schools where the Internet connection is not available. These Web contents can be used by teachers and students to enhance the teaching and learning for many class subjects. We have collaborated with a group of teachers from different high schools in order to gather the requirements for designing our software tools. One of the challenging issues is the variation in computer hardwares and network configuration found in different schools. Some shools have PCs connected to the school’s server via the Local Area Network (LAN). While some other schools have low-performance PCs without any network connection. To support both cases, we provide two solutions via two different search engine tools. These tools support content administrators, e.g., teachers, with the features to organize and index the contents.

pub.1037427703,10.1002/meet.1450430135,Making a dent? Information literacy instruction in Canada's public libraries,"This poster presents results of Canada's only recent study of information literacy (IL) practices in public libraries. The overall objective of this project was to explore the actual and potential role of public libraries in Canada in developing the public's information literacy skills. A skills deficit exists among the general population, ironically in parallel with much (misplaced) confidence about those skills; that deficit is a kind of second-level digital divide (Hargittai, 2002). Thus, access to digital information in particular is compromised in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Despite an urgent need to develop IL skills, and expectations that public libraries fulfill that role (Canadian Library Association, 1998) (imposed by the federal government ‘Connecting Canadians’ initiative, particularly via the Community Access Program) (Government of Canada, 2006), the author's previous research suggested that the real experiences of public librarians and of public library customers may not bear out this expectation. Public libraries are challenged to fulfill the policy roles imposed by the federal government, because of a systemic lack of resources, because public libraries attempt to fulfill a range of roles (e.g, social gathering place, developers of early literacy, supporters of life-long learning, supporters of recreational needs), and because library staff are conflicted about imposed mandates in the face of these historical roles.",Proceedings of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,2007,43,1,1-6,"Julien, Heidi",University of Alberta,Canada,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1037427703,1,"[Julien, Heidi; Breu, Reegan D.]|[ur.010343333645.73; ]|Library & Information Science Research|2005|27|3|281-301|10.1016/j.lisr.2005.04.002|pub.1042606187|13;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|999"

In this paper, we consider the important issue of planning such networks to the minimize system cost. This is a non-trivial task since it involves several sets of variables: the network topology, tower heights, antenna types to be used and the irorientations, and radio transmit powers. The task is further complicated due to the presence of network performance constraints, and the inter-dependence among the variables. Our first contribution in this paper is the formulation of this problem in terms of the variables, constraints and the optimization criterion. Our second contribution is in identifying the dependencies among the variables and breaking-down the problem into four tractable sub-parts. In this process, we extensively use domain knowledge to strike a balance between tractability and practicality. We have evaluated the proposed algorithms using random input sets as well as real-life instances with success. We have been able to show detailed planning of network topology, required tower heights, antenna types, and transmit powers for the Ashwini project, a long distance WiFi network under deployment in Andhra Pradesh, India, In this case, we are able to achieve within 2% additional cost of a lower bound estimate.",Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '07,2007,,,893-902,"Sen, Sayandeep; Raman, Bhaskaran",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1008980110,61,"[Mishra, Nilesh; Chebrolu, Kameswari; Raman, Bhaskaran; Pathak, Abhinav]|[ur.013064522105.32; ur.014531437405.37; ur.013001337755.41; ur.011162231545.99]|Proceedings of the 15th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '06|2006|||761-769|10.1145/1135777.1135893|pub.1010713967|63;[Raman, Bhaskaran; Chebrolu, Kameswari]|[ur.013001337755.41; ur.014531437405.37]|Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '05|2005|||156-169|10.1145/1080829.1080847|pub.1018693331|178;[Mishra, Shridhar Mubaraq; Hwang, John; Filippini, Dick; Moazzami, Reza; Subramanian, Lakshminarayanan; Du, Tom]|[; ; ; ; ; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3828||184-194|10.1007/11600930_19|pub.1033683850|42;[Chebrolu, Kameswari; Raman, Bhaskaran; Sen, Sayandeep]|[ur.014531437405.37; ur.013001337755.41; ur.013131127015.15]|Proceedings of the 12th annual international conference on Mobile computing and networking  - MobiCom '06|2006|||74-85|10.1145/1161089.1161099|pub.1048018261|121;[Brewer, E.; Demmer, M.; Du, B.; Ho, M.; Kam, M.; Nedevschi, S.; Pal, J.; Patra, R.; Surana, S.; Fall, K.]|[ur.0621176610.34; ur.013463377151.21; ur.015672411073.59; ur.011204166163.74; ur.015057310430.44; ur.013327336644.60; ur.010432051166.17; ur.016336613335.90; ur.011033044415.27; ur.07617573671.17]|Computer|2005|38|6|25-38|10.1109/mc.2005.204|pub.1061387336|223"

It is done by reviewing the awareness and readiness of the products owners who are the regional products champions from all over Thailand. This study also identifies the enabling factors, the limitations, and forecasts the future growth of e-commerce for OTOP Project. Additionally, it is beneficial to both parties; the government and the people in the rural areas, in solving the problem at the grass root level in Thailand. Five hundred products owners were selected from different products categories, 253 out of 500 responded with usable answers. The response rate was 50.6% which is higher than the expected rate for such surveys. The major problems of the existing OTOP production process and business operation are price, lack of funds for stock inventory and piracy of local wisdom. Awareness of e-commerce among these rural people is high but the level of acceptance for the knowledge and technology transferred are rather low, due to the digital divide in Thailand. Most of them are facing the same situations which are about seeking more distribution channels and enhancing more markets.","IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service, 2004.

The paper considers the applicability of the technology adoption model (TAM) to understanding the experiences of this group of people. By looking at theories of social exclusion and the project research findings, the paper argues that TAM is limited in the range of social conditions it anticipates and, thus, presumes a facility in formulating aspirations for use that people excluded from the use of ICTs cannot have. We argue that we need to consider engagement with technology rather than just adoption. We consider the implications of these findings for designing a revised basic ICT curriculum and describe the piloting of a new curriculum. We argue that, as ICTs in general—and Internet use in particular—are experienced technologies, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use need to be reformulated to recognize limitations on people’s ability to construct plans for future action since an actor’s world is disclosed through action not given in advance.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,347-364,"Cushman, Mike; Klecun, Ela",London School of Economics and Political Science,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026985012,29,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Keil, Mark]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.013136272710.25]|Information Systems Journal|2005|16|1|23-53|10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00207.x|pub.1000107294|158;[Devins, David; Darlow, Alison; Smith, Vikki]|[ur.015323153775.54; ur.015035161505.02; ur.011243517747.40]|Regional Studies|2002|36|8|941-945|10.1080/0034340022000012360|pub.1009534134|15;[Cornford, Tony; Klecun-Dabrowska, Ela]|[ur.0751026411.53; ur.0741234155.55]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||291-305|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_18|pub.1009646881|6;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Technology in Society|2003|25|1|99-116|10.1016/s0160-791x(02)00062-3|pub.1017627654|223;[Milbourne, Linda]|[]|International Journal of Inclusive Education|2002|6|4|325-343|10.1080/13603110210148621|pub.1026070139|15;[Ajzen, Icek]|[ur.011652717561.39]|Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|1991|50|2|179-211|10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-t|pub.1028082114|44217;[Chatman, Elfreda A.]|[ur.013651330727.81]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|1996|47|3|193-206|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(199603)47:3<193::aid-asi3>3.0.co;2-t|pub.1030071908|356;[Trentin, Guglielmo]|[ur.012453711657.47]|Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|2004|20|1|21-30|10.1111/j.1365-2729.2004.00061.x|pub.1030614648|17;[Introna, Lucas D.]|[ur.014523651252.94]|Information Systems Series|1997||||10.1007/978-1-349-14549-2|pub.1032711998|150;[]|[]|Handbook of Critical Information Systems Research|2005||||10.4337/9781845426743|pub.1036154872|39;[LIVINGSTONE, SONIA]|[ur.014400337707.47]|The Communication Review|2004|7|1|3-14|10.1080/10714420490280152|pub.1043852700|475;[Selwyn, Neil]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Information Communication & Society|2003|6|3|350-375|10.1080/1369118032000155285|pub.1050726915|18;[Hubregtse, Sjaak]|[]|New Library World|2005|106|3/4|164-172|10.1108/03074800510587363|pub.1053626666|13;[SELWYN, NEIL; GORARD, STEPHEN; FURLONG, JOHN; MADDEN, LOUISE]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58; ur.015432003705.59]|Ageing and Society|2003|23|5|561-582|10.1017/s0144686x03001302|pub.1054868004|406;[Korupp, Sylvia E.; Szydlik, Marc]|[ur.07620562505.86; ur.016243250203.14]|European Sociological Review|2005|21|4|409-422|10.1093/esr/jci030|pub.1059572682|153;[Kvasny, Lynette]|[ur.012613150205.25]|Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|2006|10|2|00-00|10.1111/j.1083-6101.2005.tb00242.x|pub.1061923741|33;[Selwyn, Neil; Gorard, Stephen; Furlong, John]|[ur.010274414500.72; ur.013540425157.90; ur.015440007171.58]|European Journal of Communication|2005|20|1|5-26|10.1177/0267323105049631|pub.1063796540|105;[Haddon, L.G.]|[]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/14614440022225878|pub.1064003974|13;[Taylor, Shirley; Todd, Peter A.]|[; ]|Information Systems Research|1995|6|2|144-176|10.1287/isre.6.2.144|pub.1064711982|4425;[Davis, Fred D.; Bagozzi, Richard P.; Warshaw, Paul R.]|[ur.014060724401.60; ur.0712073700.63; ur.015250026703.09]|Management Science|1989|35|8|982-1003|10.1287/mnsc.35.8.982|pub.1064720609|12399;[Weick, Karl E.]|[]|Administrative Science Quarterly|1993|38|4|628|10.2307/2393339|pub.1069908660|3054;[Gefen, David; Straub, Detmar]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012470601004.22]|Journal of the Association for Information Systems|2000|1|1|1-30|10.17705/1jais.00008|pub.1100702403|895;[Lupton, Ruth]|[]||2003||||10.2307/j.ctt1t899jb|pub.1101926845|62;[Davis, Fred D.]|[]|MIS Quarterly|1989|13|3|319|10.2307/249008|pub.1102514932|26283;[Gefen, David; Straub, Detmar W.]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012470601004.22]|MIS Quarterly|1997|21|4|389|10.2307/249720|pub.1102515095|1188;[Venkatesh, Viswanath; Brown, Susan A.]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|2001|25|1|71|10.2307/3250959|pub.1102515144|737;[Lamb; Kling]|[; ]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|2|197|10.2307/30036529|pub.1102515228|367;[Gefen; Karahanna; Straub]|[ur.010724440512.07; ; ur.012470601004.22]|MIS Quarterly|2003|27|1|51|10.2307/30036519|pub.1102515265|3895;[Brown; Venkatesh]|[ur.015013030056.05; ur.013441135216.52]|MIS Quarterly|2005|29|3|399|10.2307/25148690|pub.1102515305|751"

pub.1024930104,10.1145/602330.602341,A visualization design repository for mobile devices,"Mobile devices with multimedia and graphics capabilities have great potential in a wide variety of applications. In addition to location-based services, mobile-commerce and multimedia entertainment that are often viewed as promising applications of third generation mobile networks mobile devices also offer a potential solution to bridging the digital divide in developing countries. Mobile devices could be used to provide essential IT services like internet access, communication, information, education and banking in areas where no fully developed infrastructures like the electric grid and wire-based net connections are available. Highly usable interfaces will be a critical factor in the development of successful mobile devices and applications. This is especially true if such IT services should become accessible to illiterate or semi-literate users and users without any previous computer experience where the interface will have to rely largely on graphics and speech as interaction mechanisms. However, the design of multimedia-based interfaces for mobile devices is currently complicated by a lack of standardized visualization techniques and interaction mechanisms and the absence of related component libraries and style guides. As a first step towards the development of a standardized set of device-independent presentation and interaction techniques we are currently working on a repository of visualization design solutions for mobile UIs which will later be extended to include general interaction techniques.","Proceedings of the 2nd international conference on Computer graphics, virtual Reality, visualisation and interaction in Africa  - AFRIGRAPH '03",2003,,,57-62,"Paelke, Volker; Reimann, Christian; Rosenbach, Waldemar",University of Paderborn,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1024930104,21,"[Bederson, Benjamin B.; Meyer, Jon; Good, Lance]|[ur.0617431334.34; ur.015477302313.41; ur.016274662713.25]|Proceedings of the 13th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '00|2000|||171-180|10.1145/354401.354754|pub.1011669591|147;[Rist, Thomas; Brandmeier, Patrick]|[ur.013154104613.04; ur.014066540601.00]|Personal and Ubiquitous Computing|2002|6|4|260-268|10.1007/s007790200026|pub.1028671700|21;[Kawachiya, Kiyokuni; Ishikawa, Hiroshi]|[ur.016451151621.40; ]|Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI '98|1998|||1-8|10.1145/274644.274645|pub.1039498762|11;[Briscoe, Mary Helen]|[]||1996||||10.1007/978-1-4612-3986-4|pub.1041687018|44;[Mackinlay, Jock]|[ur.014040445526.54]|ACM Transactions on Graphics|1986|5|2|110-141|10.1145/22949.22950|pub.1046624044|1095;[Brewster, Stephen A; Cryer, Peter G]|[ur.010245101071.13; ]|CHI '99 extended abstracts on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '99|1999|||224-225|10.1145/632716.632855|pub.1047063005|26"

Indeed, the Internet is expected to do no less than virtually transform society. Yet even as the Internet races ambitiously toward critical mass, some social scientists are beginning to examine carefully the policy implications of current demographic patterns of Internet access and usage. Key demographic variables like income and education drive the policy questions surrounding the Internet because they are the most likely have a differential impact on the consequences of interactive electronic media for different segments in our society. Given these concerns, we set out to conduct a systematic investigation of the differences between whites and African Americans in the United States with respect to computer access, the primary current prerequisite for Internet access, and Web use. We wished to examine whether observed race differences in access and use can be accounted for by differences in income and education, how access influences use, and when race matters in the calculus of equal access. The particular emphasis of this research is on how such differences may be changing over time. We believe our results may be used as a window through which policymakers might view the job of ensuring access to the Internet for the next generation.",Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,2006,5,3,0-0,"Hoffman, Donna L.; Novak, Thomas P.; Schlosser, Ann",Vanderbilt University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1061923611,137,"[Katz, James; Aspden, Philip]|[ur.011125014303.05; ur.011004276717.53]|Internet Research|1997|7|3|170-188|10.1108/10662249710171814|pub.1002872177|179;[]|[]|Computers & Mathematics with Applications|1997|33|4|129|10.1016/s0898-1221(97)90025-0|pub.1004779500|8;[Reagan, Joey]|[]|Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|1996|40|1|112-121|10.1080/08838159609364336|pub.1018722198|80;[GAZIANO, CECILIE]|[ur.011707047025.50]|Communication Research|1983|10|4|447-486|10.1177/009365083010004003|pub.1018914207|134;[Anderson, Teresa E.; Melchior, Alan]|[; ]|Journal of Urban Technology|1995|3|1|29-44|10.1080/10630739508724515|pub.1021125457|17;[Hoffman, Donna L.; Kalsbeek, William D.; Novak, Thomas P.]|[ur.015433304767.25; ur.0622372055.57; ur.015170142645.13]|Communications of the ACM|1996|39|12|36-46|10.1145/240483.240490|pub.1030038578|146;[Chew, Fiona; Palmer, Sushma]|[; ]|Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|1994|38|3|271-287|10.1080/08838159409364265|pub.1033039324|56;[Lawrence, Steve; Giles, C.

pub.1028294261,10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_26,The ‘Ear’ and ‘Eye’ Digital Divide,"This paper is about using technology to help people who share knowledge orally. The objective is to appreciate the social and technical needs of this preference so as to narrow the divide developing between these people and those who earn their living from written knowledge sharing. Writing is not the preferred method of knowledge sharing for the majority of peoples on earth nor is it appropriate for the majority of problems. A mix of both literacy and orality is believed to be the ideal, so a failure to develop cheap and relevant synchronous and asynchronous oral knowledge sharing technology may down play the importance of orality in the social and economic development of both the developed and developing nations. This paper will argue that IS designers interested in global diversity, equity, innovation and economic development through communication technology need to place more emphasis on orality. The difference between oral and written knowledge sharing will be discussed to explain the need for both synchronous and asynchronous communication technologies. A small study comparing asynchronous oral and written communication is presented as is an attempt to design an Internet based oral conferencing system to link Aboriginal communities. It was found that there was a need for developing cheap community based conferencing facilities and to improve the asynchronous oral communication technologies.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2003,,,419-434,"Metcalfe, Mike; Joham, Carmen",University of South Australia,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028294261,3,"[Isaacs, William N.]|[]|Organizational Dynamics|1993|22|2|24-39|10.1016/0090-2616(93)90051-2|pub.1000043575|416;[Shirani, Ashraf I; Tafti, Mohammed H.A; Affisco, John F]|[ur.014601303675.05; ur.07471173475.23; ur.012354071553.57]|Information & Management|1999|36|3|139-150|10.1016/s0378-7206(99)00015-4|pub.1004832322|60;[Kock, Ned]|[ur.014323551415.27]|Information Systems Journal|2001|11|2|87-110|10.1046/j.1365-2575.2001.00097.x|pub.1032978583|25;[Lawson, C]|[]|Cambridge Journal of Economics|1999|23|2|151-166|10.1093/cje/23.2.151|pub.1053423980|210;[Savard, Jean - Francois]|[]|Wicazo Sa Review|1998|13|2|83|10.2307/1409148|pub.1069474662|10;[ONG, WALTER J]|[]||1982||||10.4324/9780203328064|pub.1095908898|3110;[Walsham, Geoff; Sahay, Sundeep]|[ur.012623025165.11; ur.012234426741.58]|MIS Quarterly|1999|23|1|39|10.2307/249409|pub.1102515061|346"
pub.1027337564,10.1016/j.giq.2007.08.001,Information asymmetry and information sharing,"Although much digital divide research focuses on access to technology, another cause of the divide is the lack of information awareness that we call information asymmetry. Information asymmetry often stems from inadequate information sharing and can result in negative consequences for both the information poor and the information rich. Information asymmetry has been insufficiently studied as a possible cause of underdevelopment and inequality. In response, we develop a typology to classify information asymmetry into two categories, horizontal and vertical, and then identify those information sharing practices that cause the imbalance. To illustrate the negative consequences of information asymmetry and the potential benefits of information sharing, we discuss two examples from the experiences of modern American Indian tribes. First, Indian tribes face horizontal information asymmetry when they attempt to access the capital markets, and second, they face vertical information asymmetry in terms of law enforcement data sharing. This article also describes our ongoing examination of horizontal information sharing among tribes and vertical information sharing between tribes and others sovereigns in the American polity as possible solutions to the problems created by information asymmetry. These strategic responses are embodied in two information systems, the Tribal Financial Information Clearinghouse and an Intergovernmental Tracking System for sharing law enforcement data. We conclude with a discussion of how our typology can be more generally applied to other instances of information asymmetry.",Government Information Quarterly,2007,24,4,827-839,"Clarkson, Gavin; Jacobsen, Trond E.; Batcheller, Archer L.",University of Michigan–Ann Arbor,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027337564,45,"[de Wet, W.A.]|[ur.010413650741.50]|Economic Modelling|2004|21|4|621-630|10.1016/j.econmod.2003.09.002|pub.1000662353|12;[Hollingshead, Andrea B.; Brandon, David P.]|[ur.013766775165.34; ur.013317233424.43]|Human Communication Research|2003|29|4|607-615|10.1111/j.1468-2958.2003.tb00859.x|pub.1002979488|126;[Van Nieuwerburgh, Stijn; Veldkamp, Laura]|[ur.014753560601.69; ur.014472210425.19]|Journal of Monetary Economics|2006|53|4|753-772|10.1016/j.jmoneco.2005.02.003|pub.1007717826|198;[Flanagin, AJ; Monge, P; Fulk, J]|[ur.016436731062.59; ur.015273277007.83; ur.013307160407.53]|Human Communication Research|2006|27|1|69-93|10.1111/j.1468-2958.2001.tb00776.x|pub.1011802061|27;[Alam, Pervaiz; Walton, Karen Schuele]|[ur.016516117257.18; ur.010610426457.08]|Financial Review|1995|30|2|289-311|10.1111/j.1540-6288.1995.tb00834.x|pub.1014215787|18;[Weiler, Stephan; Scorsone, Eric; Pullman, Madeleine]|[ur.01230603771.14; ur.010654700441.36; ur.012636543602.75]|Growth and Change|2000|31|3|367-384|10.1111/0017-4815.00133|pub.1019707642|9;[Rouleau, Linda]|[ur.01127657562.90]|Journal of Management Studies|2005|42|7|1413-1441|10.1111/j.1467-6486.2005.00549.x|pub.1023873087|598;[Yu, Liangzhi]|[ur.011761531432.32]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2006|38|4|229-252|10.1177/0961000606070600|pub.1028593097|130;[Yuan, Yu; Fulk, Janet; Shumate, Michelle; Monge, Peter R.; Bryant, J.

pub.1001108200,10.1080/13691180701307354,TESTING THE LEAP-FROG HYPOTHESIS: The impact of existing infrastructure and telecommunications policy on the global digital divide,"This paper tests the ‘leap-frog’ hypothesis by modeling the impact of existing telecommunications infrastructure, controlling for economic, political and demographic factors, on changes in information communication technology (ICT) access for over 200 countries between 1995 and 2005. This study has significantly greater coverage than previous research, in terms of both time frame and country cases. First, the analysis demonstrates that in the first decade of the information society successful leap-frog countries are few and far between. Second, the relative distribution of personal computers, internet hosts and secure servers among the nations of the world has barely improved over the last decade. Third, contrary to received wisdom, most of the countries that might qualify as successful leap-frog countries are actually among the wealthiest in the world. Finally, while policy reform in the telecommunications sector can sometimes speed the diffusion of digital communication tools, the record of market reforms is mixed, and the overall effect of economic wealth is still paramount. In sum, a few poor countries have leapt ahead in the development of a few aspects of ICT infrastructure and use, but these relatively rare successes are more likely to be due to economic productivity than to privatization, regulatory separation and depoliticization, or market liberalization in the telecommunications sector.",Information Communication & Society,2007,10,2,133-157,"Howard, Philip N.",University of Washington,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001108200,30,"[Henisz, Witold J.;

Current work done in this area assumes the use of a particular type of encoding or the availability of particular facilities for the user. We wanted to come up with an implementation that did not require any special features or optimizations in the user end, and would perform just as well in all situations. For this purpose, we picked two case studies to work on in our effort to finding a suitable solution to the problem. While working on these cases, we encountered several problems and had to find our way around these problems. We had to pick and choose from a set of software packages for the one that would best serve our needs. We also had to take into consideration user convenience in using our system, for which we had to keep in mind the diverse demographics of people that might have need for such a system. Finally, we came up with the system, with all the desired features. Some possible future developments also came into mind in the course of our work, which are also mentioned in this paper.","Advances and Innovations in Systems, Computing Sciences and Software Engineering",2007,,,325-330,"Haque, Nafid; Ali, M.

This article explores recent developments in the United Kingdom (UK) which attempt to address this issue, and examines national and local information policy, community networking, and public library policy. It assesses the claim, common in the UK public library community, that the wiring up of the public libraries will have a significant impact on disadvantage, poverty and social exclusion. In particular, it analyses the process of public library networking as it has unfolded since 1997, drawing upon the empirical findings of Open to All? The Public Library and Social Exclusion (Muddiman et al. 2000), a research project funded by the UK Library and Information Commission (now Resource). This research suggests that despite a rhetorical commitment to social inclusion, the technological transformation of UK public library services will result in little more than a modernisation of current services, with little change in overall strategy or user focus. Consequently, it is argued that if public libraries are to reach out to the excluded of the information society, they will need to move beyond a passive preoccupation with access and use technological change as a means towards more active engagement with local communities and disadvantaged users so that the public library will indeed be open to all.",Libri,2001,51,4,183-194,"Dutch, Martin; Muddiman, Dave",Leeds Beckett University,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1017253991,22,"[Moore, Nick]|[]|The Political Quarterly|1997|68|3|276-283|10.1111/1467-923x.00093|pub.1014852000|8;[Smith, Peter]|[]|Vine|1995|Volume 25|Issue 1|15-23|10.1108/eb040555|pub.1022115704|3;[GRAHAM, STEPHEN; MARVIN, SIMON]|[; ]||1995||||10.4324/9780203430453|pub.1039498836|757;[Williamson, Matthew]|[]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2000|32|4|178-186|10.1177/096100060003200403|pub.1048125661|11;[Williamson, M.]|[]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2000|32|4|178-186|10.1177/0961000004244785|pub.1063902147|8;[Carter, Dave]|[]|The Governance of Cyberspace|1997|||136-154|10.4324/9780203360408_chapter_9|pub.1087802750|27"
pub.1041213087,10.1145/1328057.1328104,E-government readiness: from the design table to the grass roots,"e-Government generally refers to the government's use of information technologies (such as LANs, WANs, the Internet, Intranet, and mobile computing) to exchange information and services with citizens, businesses, general public and other arms of government. e-Readiness refers to a country's ability to take advantage of the Internet as an engine of economic growth and human development. In this aspect, several benchmarking indices are available at the macro (also called global) level by the UNPAN, World Bank, EU and others, and e-Readiness indices at the macro level are constructed primarily for ranking countries. These are concerned with the global digital divide, i.e., the gap between countries that have access to ICT and those that do not, mainly because of differences in income, education, culture, etc. are being taken into consideration. However, it has been realized that a micro-level measurable criteria needs to be developed, though they already exists in discrete format, which have been developed by institutions and academics. At micro level, performance measuring tools needs to be developed to dictate appropriate design, planning, implementation, and monitoring criteria so that relevant programmes could really become essential component of society development, and at the same time contribute to human development. It is increasingly clear that for a country to put ICT for effective use, it must be ""e-ready"" in terms of infrastructure, the accessibility of ICT to the population at large, and the effect of the legal and regulatory framework on ICT use. A key indicator of e-readiness is infrastructure and in developing countries this is often a key challenge to the advancement of society. There are many elements to e-readiness such infrastructure, telecommunications, Internet connectivity and skills set as obtained from various sources. At the same time, infrastructure also refers to utilities such as roads, electricity, water and sanitation and these are all relevant components for any ICT4D-social enterprise setting up operations in developing counties. If the digital divide is going to be narrowed, all of these issues must be addressed in a coherent and achievable strategy so that they can be tailored to meet the local needs of particular countries. A good fact is that developing country leaders can use e-readiness assessment to help them measure and plan for ICT integration. It can help them focus their efforts from within, and identify areas where external support or aid is required. But an assessment alone is insufficient, and decision-makers face four key challenges in making effective use of this tool. First, they need to understand how ICT can help their countries achieve economic and social benefits, and set achievable goals accordingly. Second, they must take concrete steps toward effective and sustainable ICT uses that will help their countries realize their objectives. Third, there must be measurable criteria to be developed, so that their implementations can be ranked, and finally, an appropriate data mining solution needs to be established for taking necessary steps in reconciliation, management and future expansion.

In our disparate world characterized by major differences between income levels, religion, language, economic development, technology penetration, infrastructure, information access, and knowledge of people, it is essential to develop and implement integrated short term and long term programs to share the benefits of this “new brave world”. In this regards, the situation of the developing countries is most crucial and challengeable. One of the most important factors that can help developing countries to bridge this meta-digital divide is Human Resource Development (HRD) for Information Technology and the E-activity age. The Islamic Republic of Iran is trying to be an effective part of the information age society among the developing countries. Despite the attractive capacity of Iran's human resources and regarding the geo-economical and geopolitical positions of Iran, it is necessary to develop integrated HRD programs to lead and manage this inevitable process. In this article, the possible HRD approaches investigated and analyzed. With emphasizing on the human resources, we studied the current situations of Iran in terms of different aspects of digital age and using a conceptual model assessed appropriate approaches of developing human resources for society of Iran with the aim of accelerating the speed of its growth and adaptation in the digital age.",2006 Technology Management for the Global Future - PICMET 2006 Conference,2006,3,,1186-1202,"Sameni, M.

Giving an opportunity to the vast majority of the population living in rural areas, to cross the digital divide to obtain access to information resources and services provided by ICT is the next revolution waiting to happen. Although this is a development issue, it is just not the government, non-government organizations or the rural masses that have a role to play. Private profit-making institutions can develop solutions to capture the hitherto unrecognized markets, make profits and at the same time aid the rural societies. The new technologies being developed can help surmount barriers present in providing information resources at a low cost and make applications feasible and profitable. This paper presents some cases where ICT has been effectively used for the benefit of the rural societies and analyzes the opportunities that lie in this sphere. The cases range from successful use of ICT in governance, to ICT solutions for improved profits to ICT in microfinance. A case of an initiative by a large mainstream corporation to reach out to the rural sector, help in development and realize profits mutually is also presented. The projects discussed should generate more interest and facilitate private investment in the hitherto virgin territory.

The work started from the premise that overall more women than men are excluded from the information society, both as users and as designers of new information and communications technologies (ICTs). Our literature review (Sørensen & Stewart, 2002) confirmed that there is still a gender gap in terms of ownership of some ICT products and, to a lesser extent, in terms of access and use. Gender cuts across other dynamics in the digital divide—income, occupation and age being generally more significant than gender—with other factors (e.g., ethnic minorities, lone parent families) also intervening. Although the trend with respect to the use of ICT products is one of a closing gender gap, it is clear that diffusion alone is not sufficient to close the gap all together; inclusion efforts are still warranted in this area. By contrast, the literature review revealed a persistent and sizeable gender gap within computer specialisms and professions designing ICTs. The proportion of women entering computer science and engineering courses in most countries is static or in decline, in spite of sustained inclusion efforts. So, the overall picture across Europe is a contradictory one: optimistic with respect to what we call women and ICT (users), and pessimistic with respect to women in ICT (professionals).",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,636-642,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Faulkner, Wendy; Lie, Merete",University of Edinburgh,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022672949,1,

In March 2000, an estimated 276 million persons worldwide were using the Internet with a growth rate of roughly 150,000 persons per day. 220 million devices were accessing the worldwide web, and almost 200,000 devices were being added daily. Web pages totaled 1.5 billion with almost 2 million pages being added each day. E-commerce, or business conducted over the Internet, totaled US $ 45 billion as recently as 1998. An estimate in January 2000 projected it could explode to over US $ 7 trillion as early as 2004. These are astonishing figures, unprecedented by any measure, but they reflect the activity of less than 5% of the world’s population. The gross disparity in the spread of the Internet and of the economic and social benefits derived from it is a matter of profound concern.

These phenomena are aided and propelled by a new “network intelligence” consummated in the introduction of information and communication technology (ICT). The world has also witnessed a reinvention of the whole process of governance that has impacted society in various ways. Through the Internet and digital connectivity, today’s world has come to be closer than ever before. Efficiency and processes of governance have been improved through faster information flow in the governance chain. Bottlenecks and cost of labor have been reduced across the world. Furthermore, ICT has opened new possibilities, improved transparency and access to information as well as partnership and collaboration, leading to improved relationships between the citizen and state. While Europe and North America, as well as some countries of Asia and the pacific, have taken advantage of this development to improve their economies and governance process, Ningo (1999) observes that sub-Saharan Africa has remained either passive or in the periphery, often reduced to a consumer for reasons related to its history or its system of governance—or lack of one.

pub.1093328710,10.1109/compsac.2006.145,Modeling Web Accessibility: A Case Study on Texas A&M University People Website,"Statistic analyses are applied to empirical data to test the internet accessibility. Results indicate a strong statistical correlation between internet access and computer domain density at international scale, but visit pages/host does not show a correlation with either computer domain density or physical distance. At international scale, access hosts are the most from North America, followed by Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa in a decreasing order. Visit pages/hosts are the highest from China, Japan, and U.S.A, followed by South Korea, Australia, and Canada in a decreasing order among the top 28 countries. At national and regional (Texas) scales, physical distance plays an important role to shape internet access and visit pages/host. The closer the distance to the internet server, more access from that physical location occurs. Access hosts have an exponent relationship with distance as gravity model, visit pages/host have a linear and exponent relationship with distance respectively. In the national scope, access hosts are relatively higher from Boston, New Haven (CT), New York, San Jose, and L.A. in comparison with similar distant cities. These may be due to the higher computer domain density in these areas. Statistical analyses suggest that claim of “death in distance” in the information age is misled and digital divide varies in a different scale. The results support “declining importance of distance in individual accessibility”.",30th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC'06),2006,2,,115-118,"Wang, Yong; Simmons, Dick",Texas A&M University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093328710,1,"[Jenkins, Rhys]|[ur.012436217121.46]|Journal of International Development|2003|16|1|1-12|10.1002/jid.1059|pub.1006705402|46;[Wang, Yong; Lai, Phillip; Sui, Daniel]|[; ; ur.07544006763.09]|Journal of Geographical Systems|2003|5|4|381-405|10.1007/s10109-003-0117-9|pub.1010705937|28;[Liu, Suxia; Zhu, Xuan]|[ur.013030422074.00; ur.011435461074.34]|Environment and Planning B Urban Analytics and City Science|2004|31|1|105-124|10.1068/b305|pub.1018708558|155;[Kwan, Mei‐Po; Weber, Joe]|[ur.015714072172.79; ur.07572637027.51]|Geographical Analysis|2003|35|4|341-353|10.1111/j.1538-4632.2003.tb01119.x|pub.1031214439|205;[Murnion, S.; Healey, R.

However, a broader view is needed. That perspective would include the relation of women and IT in the communities in which they live as well as the larger society. The information society that has emerged includes the United States (U.S.) and the globalized economy of which it is an integral part. Women and minorities, such as African Americans and Latinos, are underrepresented in computer science (CS) and other IT positions in the U.S. In addition, while they are no longer numerically underrepresented in access to computers and the Internet, as of 2000 (Gorski, 2001), they continue to enjoy fewer benefits available through the medium than white boys and men. The following article explores the diversity within women from the perspectives of race, ethnicity and social class in North America, mainly the U.S. The technology gender and racial gap persists in education and in the IT workforce.

Specifically, the aim is to analyse factors that may explain the differences in broadband adoption among SMEs and to explore their significant interrelations. The investigation relies on a two-step procedure: first, using a tree-based technique, relevant variables and interactions are explored; then, through a binomial logistic regression, their impact on broadband diffusion is estimated and tested. Findings confirm that the relative size of the company (a proxy for firm’s internal resources) is still relevant among SMEs; in addition, the geographical area where SMEs are located (environmental resources) can act as a further obstacle especially for the smaller companies of the sample; finally, specific ICT organizational strategies - namely the outsourcing decisions - proved to be an important mitigating factor for size and location-based broadband disadvantages.",International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship,2006,24,1,83-99,"Arbore, Alessandro; Ordanini, Andrea",Bocconi University,Italy,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045648215,35,"[Loh, Lawrence; Venkatraman, N.]|[ur.014047106453.27; ur.014276136305.51]|Journal of Management Information Systems|1992|9|1|7-24|10.1080/07421222.1992.11517945|pub.1010461513|430;[Freel, Mark S.]|[ur.013274103653.09]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2000|18|2|60-80|10.1177/0266242600182003|pub.1020040769|206;[Mehrtens, Jenni; Cragg, Paul B.; Mills, Annette M.]|[; ur.014144016142.56; ur.016403243033.82]|Information & Management|2001|39|3|165-176|10.1016/s0378-7206(01)00086-6|pub.1024959310|411;[Haughton, Domlnlque; Oulabi, Samer]|[; ur.011777225046.31]|Journal of Direct Marketing|1993|7|3|16-26|10.1002/dir.4000070305|pub.1026191520|26;[Ricci, Andrea]|[]|Telematics and Informatics|2000|17|1-2|141-167|10.1016/s0736-5853(00)00002-2|pub.1031906557|40;[Dandridge, Tom; Levenburg, Nancy M.]|[; ur.015154720533.89]|International Small Business Journal Researching Entrepreneurship|2000|18|2|81-91|10.1177/0266242600182004|pub.1033803171|48;[Riemenschneider, Cynthia K.; Harrison, David A.; Mykytyn, Peter P.]|[ur.07462365171.21; ur.01175275535.42; ur.015643744302.87]|Information & Management|2003|40|4|269-285|10.1016/s0378-7206(02)00010-1|pub.1035903226|310;[Levy, Margi; Powell, Philip]|[ur.015526566203.58; ur.015510442771.15]|Small Business Economics|1998|11|2|183-196|10.1023/a:1007912714741|pub.1038371225|124;[Yang, Chyan; Huang, Jen-Bor]|[ur.01126632313.54; ]|International Journal of Information Management|2000|20|3|225-239|10.1016/s0268-4012(00)00007-4|pub.1039377974|136;[Grubesic, Tony H.; Murray, Alan T.]|[ur.01102232364.97; ur.011335074125.33]|Papers of the Regional Science Association|2002|81|2|197-221|10.1007/s101100100096|pub.1041955449|88;[Thong, J.Y.L.; Yap, C.S.]|[ur.010227735415.39; ur.015760736627.36]|Omega|1995|23|4|429-442|10.1016/0305-0483(95)00017-i|pub.1043414262|415;[Prieger, James E.]|[ur.014605206564.75]|Economic Inquiry|2003|41|2|346-363|10.1093/ei/cbg013|pub.1046360997|138;[Corrocher, Nicoletta; Ordanini, Andrea]|[ur.011256716263.36; ur.015022300133.21]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|1|9-19|10.1080/02683960210132061|pub.1058311977|118;[Daniel, Elizabeth M.; Grimshaw, David J.]|[ur.015535626251.48; ur.011456614523.78]|Journal of Information Technology|2002|17|3|133-147|10.1080/0268396022000018409|pub.1058311997|113;[Sawyer, Steve; Allen, J.

pub.1036600964,10.1016/j.iilr.2005.09.004,ICT and rural societies: Opportunities for growth,"The application of ICT solutions for the development of rural India and other developing countries opens up a vast range of possibilities. Giving an opportunity to the vast majority of the population living in rural areas, to cross the digital divide to obtain access to information resources and services provided by ICT is the next revolution waiting to happen. Although this is a development issue, it is just not the government, non-government organizations or the rural masses that have a role to play. Private profit-making institutions can develop solutions to capture the hitherto unrecognized markets, make profits and at the same time aid the rural societies. The new technologies being developed can help surmount barriers present in providing information resources at a low cost and make applications feasible and profitable. This paper presents some cases where ICT has been effectively used for the benefit of the rural societies and analyzes the opportunities that lie in this sphere. The cases range from successful use of ICT in governance, to ICT solutions for improved profits to ICT in microfinance. A case of an initiative by a large mainstream corporation to reach out to the rural sector, help in development and realize profits mutually is also presented. The projects discussed should generate more interest and facilitate private investment in the hitherto virgin territory. A large number of hurdles still remain but creative ideas, breakthrough ICT technologies and committed organizations can usher in the next revolution in the developing world.",The International Information & Library Review,2005,37,4,345-351,"Mathur, Akshay; Ambani, Dhirubhai",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1036600964,24,"[Cecchini, Simone; Scott, Christopher]|[ur.010657704011.01; ]|Information Technology for Development|2003|10|2|73-84|10.1002/itdj.1590100203|pub.1022170550|213;[Sharma, Aashish; Yurcik, William]|[; ur.012421223601.47]|Bulletin of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2005|27|4|23-27|10.1002/bult.205|pub.1034303794|6"

Design/methodology/approach The paper first analyzes the definition and features of the digital library, and is followed by an introduction to the development of VRS in China. Through literature search and checking web sites, some 400 documents in CNKI have been analysed on VRS from the period of January, 1990 to June, 2005, and the situation in developing VRS and problems existing in the course of doing it in China have been summarized. On the basis of connecting theory and practice on VRS, the paper provides general tactics on how to develop VRS for libraries in China.   Findings There are some problems existing for China to develop VRS, namely shortage of funds, the information poor, the digital divide, restrictions of information infrastructure, library management, shortage of technical knowledge and user training. The paper projects what may be needed for China to continue its development of VRS in the future. There is a need for appropriate infrastructures, strategies and mechanisms to be established in order to support the diffusion of VRS principles throughout China.   Originality/value This paper provides some observations and insights on the design and development of VRS in China. It suggests that decision makers in government agencies need to understand the existing gaps in VRS in China. Constructive suggestions are made for China to construct VRS and improve the service level.",The Electronic Library,2006,24,6,763-773,"Zheng, Songhui",Shantou University Medical College,China,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038313044,4,"[Jin, Yi; Huang, Min; Lin, Haoming; Guo, Jing]|[; ; ; ]|The Journal of Academic Librarianship|2005|31|3|287-291|10.1016/j.acalib.2005.02.003|pub.1045141521|10"

Ecommerce also can help small farmers and artisans by connecting them to markets. It is clear that in rural and urban East African countries (EAC) as well as in much of the developing world-realization of this potential is not guaranteed. We study a simple bilateral model in which ICTs, are initially endowed with ability, decide sequentially (1) whether can act as producers of (eCommerce's) or as investors (rentiers) and, then (2) which quantity of investment they would like to bring, through educations and Information Technology revolutions to poor rural area people in (EAC) so that these two (education and IT) can be well adopted and defused by integrating them to commercial life. We show the existence of “natural equilibria”, at which ICT become source and capital for eCommerce's while the remaining ones decide to be rentiers. We outlines a simple model to explain why a digital divide may exist between rich and poor, realizing the impact of eCommerce that can be executed over the internet has a potential towards economy growth. Low-cost access to information infrastructure is necessary prerequisite for the successful use of eCommerce by the poor, but it is not sufficient. The implementation of eCommerce projects needs to be performed by organizations and individuals who have the appropriate incentives to work with marginalized groups. Furthermore, the readinesses of EAC involvement as a community are identified as the key factors that foster local people to be connected to digital world.",2007 International Symposium on Communications and Information Technologies,2007,,,1297-1302,"Oreku, George S; Jiangzhong, Li; Mtenzi, Fredrick J.",Technological University Dublin,Ireland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1095462609,0,"[Johnstone, Justine]|[]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|||307-322|10.1007/978-0-387-35695-2_19|pub.1018953903|2;[Moore, G.

pub.1019892459,10.1007/0-387-34588-4_14,Social Inclusion and the Shifting Role of Technology: Is Age the New Gender in Mobile Access?,"Information and communication technologies (ICT) are at the heart of government social inclusion policy. However, the “digital divide” remains and social inclusion and technology are closely linked: Not having access to technology is often seen both as part of the inclusion/exclusion problem and part of the solution by enabling access to information resources through different channels. Yet, we argue that by using technology to address an inclusion/exclusion problem, it will also result in moving the problem from one area to another. The arguments in this paper have been informed by two empirical studies around a ubiquitous technology, the mobile phone. One study is primarily based on the 18 to 25 year old age groups; the other mostly on retired people. The studies show clear differences between age groups and gender in adoption and use of the mobile telephone.Social inclusion is multifaceted; it is not an either/or measure and many attributes are subjective and depend on context. Social inclusion for mobile access is also closely linked to deeply embedded structures within society, such as those traditionally associated with gender. Technology may be changing these structures; indeed, age may be the new gender. The family or social unit may also be a useful entity to consider in the exclusion debate. Technology is being used to address social exclusion; however, we suggest that while some leveling may result, there may also be different social exclusion fronts emerging.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,208,,203-215,"Adams, Carl; Fitch, Tineke",University of Portsmouth,United Kingdom,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019892459,6,"[Hebert, M A]|[]|Health Services Management Research|1998|11|2|69-79|10.1177/095148489801100201|pub.1000627749|20;[Heiskanen, Tuula; Rantalaiho, Liisa]|[ur.015426223576.00; ur.01115525200.38]|Gendered Practices in Working Life|1997|||191-196|10.1007/978-1-349-25285-5_12|pub.1010615420|6;[Adams, Carl; Fitch, Tineke]|[ur.010024575365.47; ur.016263210645.35]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2005|158||341-349|10.1007/0-387-22874-8_25|pub.1043530377|1;[Rantalaiho, Liisa; Heiskanen, Tuula]|[]|Gendered Practices in Working Life|1997||||10.1007/978-1-349-25285-5|pub.1051081342|47;[Warschauer, Mark]|[]|First Monday|2002|7|7||10.5210/fm.v7i7.967|pub.1072710766|284;[]|[]||2007||||10.4018/978-1-59140-884-0|pub.1096031120|64;[Wallace, Patricia]|[]||1999||||10.1017/cbo9780511581670|pub.1098665288|376"
pub.1045508944,10.1108/00242530510588935,The public library system in India: challenges and opportunities,"The current situation of Indian public libraries has been viewed by some as follows: the public library system in India is condemned to remain peripheral to the actual information needs of the masses; that it is in a depressed state, and serves as little more than a warehouse of recreational reading materials, a majority of which are in regional languages. This paper suggests possible remedies on how to transform the situation, and details new technological developments which are already showing the potential to change public libraries in rural India for the better. A descriptive account of the contemporary situation in India with regard to public libraries, digital technologies and development possibilities, using official statistics and the LIS literature. The challenges that face public libraries in India are listed and a vision for their future based on the concept of “ICT for development” is sketched out. It is difficult to get an overall view of this topic: authorized statistics on public libraries in India as a whole are not collected, because these libraries are the responsibility of a variety of agencies who, for various reasons, never disclose such information on a national scale. The author details new technological developments, the practical outcome of which would in particular facilitate the establishment of digital library services in rural India. This paper provides a useful overview of a library scenario on which aggregated statistical data is hard to find; and, from this summary of the present situation, goes on to suggest possible ways to transform the “digital divide” into “digital opportunities”.",Library Review,2005,54,3,180-191,"Ghosh, Maitrayee",University of Mumbai,India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1045508944,22,"[Nicholas, David; Huntington, Paul; Williams, Peter]|[ur.011274653015.81; ur.0700306724.27; ur.01233510277.60]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|6|372-384|10.1108/00012530210452573|pub.1006882081|10;[NATH, VIKAS]|[]|The International Information & Library Review|2001|33|4|317-339|10.1006/iilr.2001.0175|pub.1008977527|34;[Williamson, Kirsty; Schauder, Don; Stockfield, Louise; Wright, Steve; Bow, Amanda]|[ur.016713672371.19; ur.07733556123.12; ; ur.016571164430.16; ur.014132057323.18]|Journal of the Australian Library and Information Association|2001|50|2|157-174|10.1080/00049670.2001.10755951|pub.1022892300|15;[Stoker, David]|[ur.011624175705.41]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|2000|32|2|53-55|10.1177/096100060003200201|pub.1026199854|3;[Evald, Pierre]|[]|Program|1996|Volume 30|Issue 2|121-131|10.1108/eb047222|pub.1032257476|4;[ARORA, JAGDISH]|[ur.015453270407.41]|The International Information & Library Review|2001|33|2-3|149-165|10.1006/iilr.2001.0165|pub.1032375850|8;[Edwards, Christopher]|[]|IFLA Journal|2001|27|2|65-69|10.1177/034003520102700205|pub.1033760545|7;[Yilmaz, Bülent]|[ur.01116743406.96]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|5|326-334|10.1108/00012530210448271|pub.1038046918|2;[Fors, Martina; Moreno, Alfredo]|[; ]|Aslib Journal of Information Management|2002|54|3|198-206|10.1108/00012530210441746|pub.1048224053|27"
pub.1038939878,10.1016/b978-155558290-6/50016-x,13 The Future of Socially Responsible Information Technology Management,"This chapter discusses the future of socially responsible information technology. There are economic profits to socially responsible information technology management but achieving that benefit requires time and resources. There are numerous socially responsible information technology management programs in place around the world. Many countries are commencing to duplicate programs that have been successful in other countries. There have been myriad efforts to reduce the digital divide, utilize more energy-efficient technology, and better safeguard the privacy of information. The development of better applications that require less staff to maintain and operate, the creation of better protection for digital properties, and the production of more energy-efficient out-of-the-box technology and components are in progress. Technology manufacturers are moving at a steady pace in achieving these goals. These goals occupy third or fourth place compared with efforts to gain market share and maintain profits. One of the most vital environmental developments affecting business is the new standard for environmental management, ISO 14001. This standard is being increasingly adopted by many companies worldwide, with considerable activity in major sectors such as the motor and electronics industries. There are now many social, political, and economic forces that drive changes in how information technology will be developed and how information technology will be used in the future. Economic impact is measured by the costs to clean viruses from networks, servers, and client systems; the costs to restore lost or damaged files; and the lost productivity of workers caused by system outages and downtime.",Socially Responsible IT Management,2003,,,333-342,"Erbschloe, Michael",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1038939878,0,

This is one part of the E-namokun project, an information promotion project started in Nagoya city, Japan. E-namoSupport is a helpdesk system that has the following characteristics: (1) unlike general helpdesk systems, which generally only cover one organization, E-namoSupport has been developed through joint government, university, and NPO cooperation; (2) users are senior citizens with little or no PC experience; (3) its aim is not only to solve problems or answer questions, but also helping senior citizens learn more computer knowledge and further their computer skills. In the E-namoSupport environment we have developed four subsystems: a case trace system (CTS); a consultation management system (CMS); an FAQ System (FAQS); and an FAQ analysis system (FAQAS). We propose an information cycle model that efficiently manages information flow in the four subsystems as well as in organizations. We take senior citizens’ attributes into account using a set of quizzes that help operators describe enquiry cases and make conversation flow more smoothly. We also design an easy-to-use interface and functions that help users access FAQS. Moreover, we develop E-namoSupport as a learning environment, providing suitable learning contents by analysing users’ interests and needs, which helps users to improve their IT abilities of and enjoy life in the information age.",Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing,2007,1,,295-306,"Zhou, Wei; Yasuda, Takami; Yokoi, Shigeki",Nagoya University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1031275955,0,"[Halverson, Christine A.; Erickson, Thomas; Ackerman, Mark S.]|[ur.011420535174.75; ur.010411062343.21; ur.014566132275.29]|Proceedings of the 2004 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work  - CSCW '04|2004|||304-313|10.1145/1031607.1031657|pub.1031342082|38;[Peters, Sandra L.]|[]|Proceedings of the 20th annual ACM SIGUCCS conference on User services  - SIGUCCS '92|1992|||187-191|10.1145/143164.143303|pub.1032058794|3;[Foo, Schubert; Hui, Siu Cheung; Leong, Peng Chor]|[ur.011124171133.65; ur.015501337641.16; ur.015247642351.56]|International Journal of Systems Science|2002|33|6|389-402|10.1080/00207720210133642|pub.1038560034|9;[Sasaki, Kiichirou; Iribe, Yurie; Goto, Masato; Endo, Mamoru; Yasuda, Takami; Yoko, Shigeki]|[; ur.010405245445.71; ur.013422004453.14; ur.015160755445.10; ur.015452033001.60; ]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2005|3683||1274-1280|10.1007/11553939_177|pub.1043645612|1"

The introduction briefly examines the impact of ICTs on society and calls for alternative channels for government to serve rural communities through the use of Multi-Community Access Centres (MCACs) or information kiosks available at libraries, police stations, tourist information centres and post offices, as an e-governance initiative in the creation of “smart communities” and as a grassroots effort. No analysis of ICTs on government's functions would be complete if we did not address the growing debate on the digital divide. In this paper a section is devoted to this and it summarily addresses the growing divide between the developed and the developing world and the potential of these islands to leap–frog barriers to information flows and access. The heart of the paper examines the impact of the Internet on small island economies and the growing use of the Internet in key sectors of each economy. Since this paper is about governments’ use of ICTs to transfer business transactions onto the Internet to service their populace, some discussion is undertaken and considers ways in which innovation has impacted on governments’ services and the early attempts by some Caribbean administrations to implement e-governance. E-Voices illustrates how certain government measures affect some vulnerable groups in society and ways in which they can broker power to participate in the process.

pub.1022232993,10.1108/14779960580000273,Internet research from a gender perspective Searching for differentiated use patterns,"The current scientific and political discussion on the under‐representation of women within the Internet once again associates women with disinterest in technology in an essentialist manner. Gender‐specific attributions are unquestioningly transferred to the new media, and it is assumed that women behave in unfailing conformity with existing gender stereotypes. The intention of this paper is to show that gender research has to perform differentiated empirical studies of actual Internet use. Gender studies can then make a concrete contribution to the task of overcoming the genderdifferentiated inequalities in the access to and the use of the Internet. I shall begin by briefly outlining the dilemma of gender studies in the technical area. In the second section I shall describe the reasons for the gender‐differentiated Internet access data, using quantitative Internet studies from the USA, calling for a de‐dramatisation of difference in this context. In the third section, I will overcome the dichotomous view of the digital divide and present a research framework for differentiated study of differing use habits and use requirements. This section illustrates that such an approach does not make the gender category superfluous, but challenges gender studies to present context‐related studies, in which individual behaviour may be interpreted in the context of gender symbols and structures. My fourth step will be to explain how the new possibilities of online research can and should be used to gain further understanding in the sense of differentiated study designs. Finally, I will finish with a short outlook where I am calling for an equal representation of all societal groups in the Internet and therefore for an empowerment particularly of women.",Journal of Information Communication and Ethics in Society,2005,3,4,199-207,"Winker, Gabriele",Hamburg University of Technology,Germany,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022232993,4,"[Heimrath, Rosie; Goulding, Anne]|[; ur.010652214421.26]|Program|2001|35|2|119-134|10.1108/eum0000000006944|pub.1007759722|17;[Ono, Hiroshi; Zavodny, Madeline]|[ur.01306451573.22; ur.01076707606.12]|Social Science Quarterly|2003|84|1|111-121|10.1111/1540-6237.t01-1-8401007|pub.1024870490|279;[Hauptmanns, Peter; Lander, Bettina]|[ur.013015521141.29; ur.014755547412.66]|Online-Marktforschung|2001|||27-40|10.1007/978-3-322-99429-5_3|pub.1033841200|15;[SINGH, SUPRIYA]|[]|New Media & Society|2001|3|4|395-415|10.1177/1461444801003004001|pub.1049232539|86;[Hargittai, Eszter]|[ur.014036273417.00]|First Monday|2002|7|4||10.5210/fm.v7i4.942|pub.1072710742|999;[]|[]|Choice|2002|40|02|40-1165-40-1165|10.5860/choice.40-1165|pub.1073382743|912"
pub.1021548956,10.1016/b978-008045312-5/50069-8,Solar Powered Wi-Fi with Wimax Enables Third World Phones,"The lack of access to reliable energy remains a significant barrier to sustainable socioeconomic development in the world’s poorest countries. Majority of their population are largely concentrated in the rural areas and access to power is often sporadic or altogether lacking. Without power the traditional telecom infrastructure is impossible. So these lower income strata people are living for years without electricity or telephones, relying on occasional visitors and a sluggish postal system for news of the outside world. So if electricity is playing havoc, there is a need to devise low tech solutions to help bridge not only the digital divide but also the electrical divide. One of such solution is a solar and pedal powered remote ICT system by Inveneo a non-profit organization which combines the power of the computer and a clever application of the increasingly popular Wi-Fi wireless technology powered by solar energy. With this system the rural villagers pedal onto the hand-built, bicycle-powered PC in the village which would send signals, via an IEEE 802.11b connection, to a solar-powered mountaintop relay station. The signal would then bounce to a server in the nearest town with phone service and electricity and from there to the Internet and the world. This paper describes a prototype of how the wireless broadband WiMAX technology can be integrated in to the existing system and gain global possibilities. With the new suggested prototype each village will connect to one WiMAX station through the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) which is powered by a solar means. The WiMAX tower then send the radio signal to fixed fiber backbone that will connect the villages to the Internet and enables VoIP communications.",Proceedings from the International Conference on Advances in Engineering and Technology,2006,,,635-646,"Santhi, K.R.; Kumaran, G.

The analysis is based upon research carried out in two areas: the first combining a remote rural town with a much larger, more sparsely populated, rural ‘travel-to-work area’; the second, a centrally located peri-urban labour market. Survey research undertaken in the study areas gathered responses from 490 unemployed jobseekers. Emerging issues were then followed up during twelve focus groups. The study found that the use of ICT for job seeking remained a marginal activity for most unemployed people, but was much more important in remote rural communities. In these areas, jobseekers were more likely to use the Internet as a search tool and were particularly dependent on telephone helplines provided by the public employment service (PES). However, the study also found that a ‘digital divide’ was evident within the unemployed client group. Those with low educational attainment, the long-term unemployed, young people and those perceiving their ICT skills to be ‘poor’ were less likely to use the Internet. Although respondents in rural areas were more likely to use ICT to look for work, they also pointed to the overriding importance of informal, social networks as a means of sharing job information in remote communities. We conclude that ICT may have a future role in the delivery of services for jobseekers, especially in rural areas. However, policies are required to ensure that information provided through ICT-based services is locally relevant, and disadvantaged groups have access to the facilities and training they require.",Information Communication & Society,2004,7,3,364-388,"McQuaid, Ronald; Lindsay, Colin; Greig, Malcolm",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028377981,23,"[Liff, Sonia; Steward, Fred]|[ur.015432352362.07; ur.07710634033.98]|Information Communication & Society|2001|4|3|317-340|10.1080/713768550|pub.1000746199|17;[Servaes, Jan; Heinderyckx, Francois]|[ur.010751772465.57; ur.012733526033.47]|Telematics and Informatics|2002|19|2|91-115|10.1016/s0736-5853(01)00008-9|pub.1002551163|19;[Mansell, Robin]|[ur.013665171232.89]|Current Sociology|2002|50|3|407-426|10.1177/0011392102050003007|pub.1004956599|133;[Burrows, Roger; Nettleton, Sarah; Pleace, Nicholas; Loader, Brian; Muncer, Steven]|[ur.01273352061.20; ur.01367521004.09; ur.01255535170.75; ur.07466121066.46; ur.01270020704.21]|Information Communication & Society|2000|3|1|95-121|10.1080/136911800359446|pub.1008163839|140;[Devins, David; Darlow, Alison; Smith, Vikki]|[ur.015323153775.54; ur.015035161505.02; ur.011243517747.40]|Regional Studies|2002|36|8|941-945|10.1080/0034340022000012360|pub.1009534134|15;[Lindsay, Colin; McCracken, Martin; McQuaid, Ronald W.]|[ur.013235004557.97; ur.07646226343.56; ur.010521665531.52]|Journal of Rural Studies|2003|19|2|187-200|10.1016/s0743-0167(02)00067-0|pub.1009578650|43;[Carter, Chris; Grieco, Margaret]|[; ur.010706615761.80]|Urban Studies|2000|37|10|1735-1748|10.1080/00420980020080361|pub.1009715424|29;[Graham, Stephen]|[]|Urban Studies|2002|39|1|33-56|10.1080/00420980220099050|pub.1010968716|240;[Haddon, Leslie]|[ur.014203031645.98]|New Media & Society|2000|2|4|387-406|10.1177/1461444800002004001|pub.1024226259|86;[Phipps, Linda]|[]|Information Communication & Society|2000|3|1|39-68|10.1080/136911800359419|pub.1026431128|62;[Servon, Lisa J.; Nelson, Marla K.]|[ur.012235551203.08; ur.014320504531.98]|International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|2001|25|2|419-426|10.1111/1468-2427.00320|pub.1030496710|14;[SELWYN, NEIL]|[ur.010274414500.72]|Journal of Social Policy|2002|31|1|1-20|10.1017/s0047279402006487|pub.1035487375|76;[Borgida, Eugene; Sullivan, John L.; Oxendine, Alina; Jackson, Melinda S.; Riedel, Eric; Gangl, Amy]|[ur.016617635476.55; ur.012513746555.18; ur.015362674227.81; ur.016205057705.44; ur.014126235723.73; ur.016316557323.21]|Journal of Social Issues|2002|58|1|125-141|10.1111/1540-4560.00252|pub.1048479053|55;[Loader, Brian D.; Muncer, Steve; Burrows, Roger; Pleace, Nicholas; Nettleton, Sara]|[ur.07466121066.46; ur.010431176324.05; ur.01273352061.20; ur.01255535170.75; ]|International Journal of Social Welfare|2002|11|1|53-65|10.1111/1468-2397.00196|pub.1048999605|67;[Mcquaid, Ronald W.]|[ur.010521665531.52]|Regional Studies|2002|36|8|909-919|10.1080/0034340022000012333|pub.1052714796|44;[Huggins, Robert; Izushi, Hiro]|[ur.011253325321.73; ur.011332420503.59]|Local Economy The Journal of the Local Economy Policy Unit|2002|17|2|111-122|10.1080/02690940210129870|pub.1058312313|42;[Silcock, R]|[]|Parliamentary Affairs|2001|54|1|88-101|10.1093/pa/54.1.88|pub.1059968080|189;[Gabe, Todd M.; Abel, Jaison R.]|[ur.016330367405.10; ur.015237660773.36]|American Journal of Agricultural Economics|2002|84|5|1246-1252|10.1111/1467-8276.00385|pub.1061833777|21;[WELLMAN, BARRY; HAASE, ANABEL QUAN; WITTE, JAMES; HAMPTON, KEITH]|[ur.011001756750.07; ur.010727323145.18; ur.0624563644.81; ur.012317624303.24]|American Behavioral Scientist|2001|45|3|436-455|10.1177/00027640121957286|pub.1063544517|1050;[Davies, Rita]|[]|Journal of Poverty and Social Justice|2002|10|2|135-139|10.51952/tzbw5786|pub.1151439610|3"
pub.1034976823,10.1108/00251740510603628,Management of infrastructures,"Purpose The aim of this paper is to compare the railway and internet revolutions. What do they have in common and what is different between them, considering the 150‐year time difference in their occurrence? As time passes, can internet developers learn something from the railway industry?   Findings The two industries have a lot of common. Both railways and the internet represent national infrastructures that cannot be managed just based on business management principles. As both are concerned with traffic, either that of physical goods or of messages, the two industries also seem to have a lot in technical terms when one takes a sufficiently abstract point of view. The main message is that in the long term, the railway revolution vanished and the industry turned into a low profit/interest field. The internet might follow the same path.   Research limitations/implications The paper in its current form is based on a literature review only. Its quality could be improved with a detailed empirical study. Other similar infrastructure‐type industries could also be involved.   Practical implications There are several things that could be improved in the management of the internet, but they are large‐scale issues needing co‐operation between the many stakeholders in the internet. Examples are those of avoiding the digital divide and catering for critical “last mile” connections, as well as managing the diversity of different standards.   Originality/value As far as the author knows this is the first paper of its kind comparing these two industries. The message is that more cross‐industrial studies need to be performed. Also, the message of the paper – that the internet might turn into a low‐interest business in the long run – has not been discussed sufficiently.",Management Decision,2005,43,6,896-905,"Suomi, Reima",University of Turku,Finland,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1034976823,4,"[Ruzic, Fjodor]|[]|The Information Society|1989|6|3|109-116|10.1080/01972243.1989.9960075|pub.1004224308|2;[Gillett, Sharon Eisner]|[ur.014205054675.54]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|147-149|10.1080/01972240050032906|pub.1007433536|13;[Rosen, Kenneth T.; Howard, Amanda L.]|[; ]|California Management Review|2000|42|3|72-100|10.2307/41166043|pub.1008737664|111;[Arnbak, Jens]|[ur.014220275171.26]|European Management Journal|1988|6|4|330-337|10.1016/0263-2373(88)90035-7|pub.1012499238|5;[Bar, Annemarie Munk Riis Francois]|[]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|99-108|10.1080/01972240050032852|pub.1015812789|21;[Lievrouw, Leah A.]|[ur.015617015543.53]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|155-159|10.1080/01972240050032924|pub.1016388422|27;[Goggin, Christopher Newell Gerard]|[]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|127-133|10.1080/01972240050032889|pub.1017914438|42;[Skogerbo, Tanja Storsul Eli]|[]|The Information Society|2000|16|2|135-146|10.1080/01972240050032898|pub.1018224571|9;[Schement, Scott C.

pub.1047049146,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch238,Toward U-Government in Japan,"Japan is set to move forward to developing a broadband and ubiquitous network society as envisioned under the concept of an advanced information society. And the successful implementation of e-government in Japan will serve as the foundation to achieving this goal. How does e-government affect the government itself, the business sector and the citizens? According to a 2005 user survey by the Institute of E-Government, the two main benefits of e-government are improved accessibility to information and transaction, and greater accountability from the government. To administer e-government in the country, the role of public sector and computerizations in various government agencies were taken into consideration. However, if computerization is limited to central government, this is of limited benefit to citizens. Thus, for communication between citizens and government, there is a need to go mainly through local government, not the central government directly. There is also a need to refer to e-municipality or e-local government, considering it of equal importance to e-government. It is also important to take into account issues against some aspects of an information society, but being overly anxious about them causes obstacles to promoting e-government. These issues include information security problems, lack of unified management of agencies and the risk of socio-economic digital divide. As such, one of the problems that every country has to face in promoting e-government is the legal system, embedded in every democratic government. Computerization and informatization of the government is, in one respect, an effective administrative and fiscal reform, but requires legal mandates. Thus, reforms in the legal system, including regulation system, are inevitably called for.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1554-1561,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Obi, T.",Waseda University,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047049146,1,
pub.1017204901,10.1207/s15327590ijhc1704_3,The Computer-Email-Web (CEW) Fluency Scale-Development and Validation,"The purpose of this research was to develop an instrument to assess people's fluency with the computer, e-mail, and the Web (CEW fluency). Such an instrument, tapping into digital divides, could fill the existing void that exists between previously developed computer literacy or experience scales and the ever faster development of Internet technology. The research was conducted in 2 stages. The first study (N = 284) tested 52 Internet fluency items. A principle component factor analysis with varimax rotation resulted in 21 remaining items in 4 constructs: computer fluency (α = .85), e-mail fluency (α = .89), Web navigation (α = .84), and Web editing (α = .82). The 4-factor solution accounted for more than 67% of the total variance. Correlation analysis showed that there was no multicolinearity of items. The second study (N = 143) aimed at testing the CEW Fluency Scale for reliability and validity. Participants completed a 77-item questionnaire containing the CEW Fluency Scale, the Computer Use Scale (Panero, Lane, & Napier, 1997), items from the Georgia Tech WWW survey (GVU, 1998), and demographic items. The 4 constructs of the CEW Fluency Scale held up in the reliability analysis, as Cronbach's alphas were as follows: computer fluency (α = .72), e-mail fluency (α = .75), Web navigation (α = .64), and Web editing (α = .79). Correlation analysis showed that comfort with the computer or the Internet, or satisfaction with one's skills, correlated highly with the CEW fluency items. Regression analysis revealed that duration of Internet usage and level of expertise as defined by the Georgia Tech WWW survey were the strongest predictors of CEW fluency, R = .614, adjusted R² = .368, F(2, 131) = 39.643, p < .001.

pub.1061923735,10.1111/j.1083-6101.2004.tb00299.x,The Adoption and Use of the Internet in South Korea,"Recent surveys indicate that the rapid rate of Internet use in South Korea is one of the highest in the world. Indeed, as the one of leading nations for high‐speed broadband access, South Korean Internet users virtually dominate the entire gamut of Internet activities‐everything from web searches to games to Instant Messenger (IM) chatting‐and are one of the leading consumers of on‐line shopping for services and goods (“e‐commerce”). Even popular social movements have gone “on‐line” in South Korea with civil organizations effectively mobilizing their resources through Internet networking. However, a widespread disparity in Internet use has recently come to light in South Korea. In particular, Internet use has been clearly divided by generations, which threatens to create a “new” generation gap and the possibility of further generational conflict in a society already marked by deep generational cleavages. In this paper, we touch upon the adoption of the Internet on the basis of research data that examines the digital divide on a national scale. We examine socio‐demographic factors, attitudes toward the Internet, social supports (family support, in particular), and the influence that Internet access has had on the South Korean populace, paying particular attention to diffusion theory which has been considered the most feasible explanation for South Korea's rapid Internet adoption. This research indicates that Internet adoption in South Korea is influenced more by family support than by other characteristics.

This is being achieved by making expeditious attempts to provide online public sector products and services on a nationwide basis. However, there are certain regions and groups of the populace in a country where this aim will not be achieved. Aims to focus on this.   Design/methodology/approach Using two comparative case studies and a combination of qualitative and quantitative data, this research identifies the challenges being faced by the UK government in ensuring e‐government products and services to both the rural and urban areas. The London Borough of Hillingdon is used to illustrate the case of the urban area, whilst Conwy County Borough Council is the rural case.   Findings The research found that while citizens' backgrounds influenced accessibility to e‐government services in the urban area, geographic location related issues were posing problems to the same in the rural area.   Practical implications While illustrating a digital divide, this implies that the UK government still has challenges to overcome, as it has to obtain and convince the citizens to attain internet access that will allow them to acquire the online products and services offered by the government. Amongst other challenges to be encountered are how to overcome the organisational and technical issues that could impede the desired integration of business processes and technologies across government institutions for effective e‐governance.

pub.1031657950,10.1145/1236224.1236228,"Interview with George Lucas: (October 4, 2006)","In this special January 2007 issue on Interactive Entertainment, the Interviews column features a video interview with George Lucas on October 4th, 2006 at the University of Southern California. On that same day, George Lucas formally announced his donation of $175 million to the USC School of Cinematic Arts, formerly known as USC School of Cinema-Television. The reason that George Lucas renamed the world-renowned film school is due to the growing importance of interactive media in Hollywood and worldwide. Computer games have, for many years, captured the attention of Hollywood moguls such as George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. George, Steven, and many supporters of USC have decided that formal education on interactive media and gaming should be given equal priority and funding as traditional movie making and television production. Therefore, instead of appending ""Interactive Media"" to ""Cinema- Television,"" the USC school simply changed its name to ""Cinematic Arts."" The implication for interactive entertainment cannot be understated. George Lucas has essentially proclaimed that interactive media and gaming are a part of cinematic arts. Will there be a George Lucas or Steven Spielberg-like genius in next-generation interactive entertainment that will win an Oscar? You bet there will be in the near future. In the video interview, you will hear George Lucas' answers to the following questions as well as his comments at the USC School of Cinematic Arts on October 4th: 1. Is your educational foundation ""edutopia"" doing anything about the digital divide, especially in terms of access to interactive entertainment? 2. One of the themes in all of your movies is human relationship to machines and technology - either controlling them, or being controlled by them. Is that true? 3.

pub.1019755756,10.1108/02640470610714260,Managing information and technology: critical roles for librarians in developing countries,"Purpose The paper sets out to provide a critical overview of the contribution of information technology to the current shift from information to knowledge processing. It situates that shift in the context of the management challenges for librarians from the developing countries.   Design/methodology/approach The approach adopted was to review the development challenges of developing countries, the in‐trends information handling and the transition from information to knowledge management systems. The next approach was to examine statistically, the internet usage status and information and communication technology facilities in Africa. Based on the data provided and discussed the final approach was to draw up critical roles for developing countries' librarians in the knowledge age.   Findings The findings indicate the abysmal state of internet usage and ICT facilities in Africa in particular and the rest of the developing countries in general.   Research limitations/implications Librarians will be called upon to provide authentic and reliable information, evolve strategic alliances, participate in network activities and contribute to the bridging of the digital divide. They will emerge as technology experts, guides, scouts, researchers, analysts, knowledge engineers, editors, navigators, gatekeepers, brokers and asset managers. Conclusively, librarians will need to acquire new skills to access net resources, and develop new strategies and services to meet the challenges of the knowledge age.   Originality/value The results and discussions imply that it is critically important for information professionals from developing countries to begin to re‐evaluate their roles in terms of how they contribute to the management of technology and information in the knowledge age.

pub.1095667073,10.1109/ipcc.2005.1494194,Manuals for the Elderly: Text Characteristics that Help or Hinder Older Users,"The elderly seem to encounter more problems than most other users when operating modern devices and processing the accompanying instructions. In a rapidly greying society and a growing grey digital divide, it is useful to investigate how instructions can be optimized to meet the needs of elderly users and to make modern technology more accessible to the elderly. In this research project we have looked at differences between age groups, at effects of textual variants and at interactions between these factors. An exploratory investigation indicated that in instructions iconicity, the signaling of steps and the presence of goal and consequence information affect older people's task performance. This article reports three experiments, which investigated these factors more thoroughly. All three experiments included an older and a younger age group. In all three experiments age effects were found: the elderly needed more time and made more errors than the younger participants. In experiment one, iconicity and different types of signaling were investigated. Participants were exposed to simulations of procedures, which they had to judge on correctness. Unexpectedly, neither of the age groups was affected by the text variants. Experiment two investigated iconicity in more detail. Participants performed iconic and non-iconic instructions. Iconicity turned out to have an effect, and there was an interaction with age, but the results were opposite to what was expected. In the third experiment, effects of goal and consequence information were investigated. Participants performed instructions in which goal or consequence information was present or absent. In this experiment, the absence of consequence information hampered task performance in the older age group.","IPCC 2005. Proceedings.

pub.1038726097,10.1080/10572317.2003.10762609,Empowering Development Through E-Governance: Creating Smart Communities In Small Island States,"An attempt is made in this paper to gain an understanding of the current and potential impact of the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the Small Island Sates of the Caribbean, in particular those populations living in rural communities. The introduction briefly examines the impact of ICTs on society and calls for alternative channels for government to serve rural communities through the use of Multi-Community Access Centres (MCACs) or information kiosks available at libraries, police stations, tourist information centres and post offices, as an e-governance initiative in the creation of “smart communities” and as a grassroots effort. No analysis of ICTs on government's functions would be complete if we did not address the growing debate on the digital divide. In this paper a section is devoted to this and it summarily addresses the growing divide between the developed and the developing world and the potential of these islands to leap–frog barriers to information flows and access. The heart of the paper examines the impact of the Internet on small island economies and the growing use of the Internet in key sectors of each economy. Since this paper is about governments’ use of ICTs to transfer business transactions onto the Internet to service their populace, some discussion is undertaken and considers ways in which innovation has impacted on governments’ services and the early attempts by some Caribbean administrations to implement e-governance. E-Voices illustrates how certain government measures affect some vulnerable groups in society and ways in which they can broker power to participate in the process.

To date, it has not received the same amount of critical scholarship and research activity as traditional areas of social policy, but this is changing as policy scholars focus on the whole gamut of e-governance concerns. E-social policy is concerned with the social implications of information technology communication (ITC) technology in its broadest sense. E-service delivery is a narrower term, encompassing the range of ITC used by governments, churches, charities, other non-government organisations (NGOs), and community groups to deliver social and community services online. Initially, most services provided online by governments were of a commercial and business nature (Curtin, Sommer, & Vis-Sommer, 2003), but e-service delivery has evolved quite rapidly in the fields of health, education, social security, and one-stop community information systems. It is better developed in OECD countries and in specific social policy fields (social security, housing, health, education, and community care) whereas in other countries it is very poorly developed and resourced, if it exists at all (Polikanov & Abramova, 2003). Despite this uneven development, there are many innovative examples of ITC use in farming production and trade, e-health services and promotion, education, environmental pollution management, and enhancement of development strategies in poorer nations. However, there is still a long way to go in bridging the digital divide–the unequal access to ITC of richer and poorer nations.

The resulting digital divide has hitherto left these countries far behind other regions of the world in various aspects of economic development. Many technology-oriented constraints account for the low levels of teledensity in Africa. Teledensity refers to the number of main telephone lines per one hundred inhabitants. The over-dependence of Africa's LDCs on the West has been reflected in various socio-economic dimensions, including the telecommunications industry. A general desire by the LDCs to break the cycle of perpetual dependence has led to calls for a debate on what strategies can be adopted to turn things around. Possible options include the following: (a) self-sufficiency approach by each country, (b) African Regional/Foreign Alliance approach to solve the regional technology- oriented constraints to teledensity, and (c) the 'viagra' approach of total and perpetual dependence on the West to come in and apply a ""band-aid"" fix to the problem, and leave behind an infrastructure with little or no local expertise to manage it. In this paper, the term 'viagra' is used to imply a quick or ""band-aid"" prescription in the guise of a ""solution "". This study examines the perspectives or beliefs of telecommunications stakeholders of Africa's LDCs on strategies for solving the technology-oriented constraints that have been documented in the literature. The findings suggest that Africa's LDCs should adopt a self-sufficiency approach and also create regional alliances for sustainable development of telecommunications infrastructure to spur the much needed teledensity growth in the region",Journal of Global Information Technology Management,2002,5,1,25-42,"Mbarika, Victor W.; Musa, Philip F.; Byrd, Terry Anthony; McMullen, Patrick",Louisiana State University; University of Alabama at Birmingham; Auburn University,United States; United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1028980426,14,"[Hardy, Andrew P.]|[]|Telecommunications Policy|1980|4|4|278-286|10.1016/0308-5961(80)90044-0|pub.1003695597|273;[Zhang, Yin]|[]|Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|2000|51|1|57-68|10.1002/(sici)1097-4571(2000)51:1<57::aid-asi9>3.0.co;2-w|pub.1018200501|128;[Mbarika, Victor W.; Byrd, Terry Anthony; Raymond, Jennie E.; McMullen, Patrick]|[ur.010076557303.64; ur.010406565231.41; ur.013134055043.57; ur.013744167643.61]|The International Journal on Media Management|2000|2|3-4|133-142|10.1080/14241270009389932|pub.1025941457|10;[Robinson, John P.; Shaver, Phillip R.; Wrightsman, Lawrence S.]|[ur.011553235065.99; ur.0700323406.77; ur.07474216762.17]|Measures of Personality and Social Psychological Attitudes|1991|||1-16|10.1016/b978-0-12-590241-0.50005-8|pub.1052630276|713;[Parapak, J.L.]|[]|IEEE Communications Magazine|1994|32|11|40-41|10.1109/35.330222|pub.1061158990|3;[Peter, J.

Similarly, new ‘knowledge management approaches involving such concepts as ‘community of practice’ and ‘individual tacit knowledge’ are related aspirations for capacity‐building on both sides of the so‐called digital divide between rural or developing areas and modern progressive cities and countries. Common to both informal and formal learning models on one hand, and community and enterprise development is an alternately theoretical and informal assumption of “knowledge‐building” which is often contradicted or frustrated in practice because of the difficulty in effectively reconciling or connecting top‐down imperatives and bottom‐up aspects of the local context. In other words, there are some common aspects of (and lessons in) the struggle by educators to effectively integrate ICTs to enhance education on one hand, with achieving sustainable capacity‐building in ICT‐related community development projects and enterprise development initiatives on the other. This paper outlines a framework for better recognizing and engaging with similar and convergent “missing links” in the areas of education and development that have to do with the learning process, cultural change, and new conceptions of both individual and community knowledge. With particular reference to an Asia‐Pacific context, it argues for a kind of ‘dialogical’ approach that is needed in the 21st Century or digital age to better organize, manage, and apply the alternately tacit or informal and explicit connections between human knowledge as both ideas and practice.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2007,32,1,1-11,"Richards, Cameron; Nair, Govindan",University of Western Australia; World Bank,Australia; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099634551,6,"[Rosenberg, Marc J.; Foshay, Rob]|[; ]|Performance Improvement|2002|41|5|50-51|10.1002/pfi.4140410512|pub.1014515148|413;[*, Cameron Richards]|[]|Globalisation Societies and Education|2004|2|3|337-353|10.1080/1476772042000252470|pub.1026867997|42;[Wenger, Etienne]|[]||1998||||10.1017/cbo9780511803932|pub.1098702110|17762"

Inherently, virtual organizations arouse concerns about security and trustworthiness. Those with an E-customer focus further exacerbate the demands and requirements for trustworthy environments. Trust in virtual organizations is a poignant and timely issue in organizational science and the management of information systems. In the last decade, the topic of trust and virtual teams has been the subject of a scarce and rapidly expanding body of literature, which intersects Human Research Development, HRD, and Management of Information Systems, MIS. (Nandhakumar & Baskerville, 2001; Ishaya and Macauley, 2000; Galvin, 2000; Hugli, 2000, Jarvenpaa, Knoll and Leidner, 1998; Jarvenpaa and Leidner, 1998; Iacona and Weisband, 1997; Meyerson, Weick and Kramer, 1996).Entering the 21st century, the velocity of organizational change driven by IT advancements and globalization was already ferocious. However, in the last six months since 9–11, major budget cuts, drastic travel restrictions and sudden geographic distribution have become the norm in many organization to cope with the dire circumstances brought about by the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 in the United States.

Through the use of the internet, our members can learn at their leisure basic elements in many popular programming languages, operating systems, data base and network systems and project management, among others. Members have free access to 100 Web-based training courses and in 2004 will have free access to 100 online reference books through our new Online Books program. They can also take a course to study elements of software engineering to help them prepare for an examination that would certify them as a qualified software engineer. The digital library provides practicing engineers and researchers key developments in the entire computing field in the last 15 years. Based on the success in the last five years, the Computer Society plans to expand this service to cover even more ground. Long-term plans include additional certification programs, such as a credential for software project management, and additional tutorials to include more advanced topics. Perhaps even in partnership with universities to facilitate the earning of academic credentials by members.

The 3rd generation (3G)and wireless fidelity (WiFi) are the two main wireless technologies which access Internet using wireless devices. Some major cities in the U.S. have either deployed or have future plans to roll-out city-wide broadband wireless network using WiFi technology. Even if 3G and WiFi have different origins and features, they will become competing wireless Internet access services in the near future. In this paper, using a game theory, the authors build a competition model of 3G and WiFi and demonstrate which technology will have a better market position and what an optimal pricing strategy is through equilibrium analysis. The authors found that in the equilibrium analysis, WiFi could have a better market position in the future. On the other hand, by using a higher pricing strategy, the profit of 3G providers would be higher than that of WiFi providers. Finally, the municipal WiFi could be useful as a public Internet access method and prove to be competitive in this market with its attractive low pricing.",2007 Wireless Telecommunications Symposium,2007,,,1-6,"Shim, J.

For 2D square arrays with sides of prime length, the Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) is very efficient at reconstructing digital images from their digital projections. The periodic gaps in digital rays complicate the use of the DRT for efficient reconstruction of tomographic images from real projection data, where there are no gaps along the projection direction. A new approach to bridge this gap problem is to pool DRT digital projections obtained over a variety of prime sized arrays. The digital gaps are then partially filled by a staggered overlap of discrete sample positions to better approximate a continuous projection ray. This paper identifies primes that have similar and distinct DRT pixel sampling patterns for the rays in digital projections. The projections are effectively pooled by combining several images, each reconstructed at a fixed scale, but using projections that are interpolated over different prime sized arrays. The basis for the pooled image reconstruction approach is outlined and we demonstrate the principle of this mechanism works.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2003,2886,,485-494,"Svalbe, Imants; Kingston, Andrew",Monash University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042329554,3,"[Salzberg, Pablo M.; Figueroa, Raul]|[ur.016671141157.48; ur.013577111757.04]|Applied and Numerical Harmonic Analysis|1999|||417-434|10.1007/978-1-4612-1568-4_19|pub.1005069357|9;[Svalbe, Imants]|[ur.01200347405.36]|Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science|2001|46||269-284|10.1016/s1571-0661(04)80992-7|pub.1020781837|5;[Svalbe, Imants; van der Spek, Dimitri]|[ur.01200347405.36; ]|Linear Algebra and its Applications|2001|339|1-3|125-145|10.1016/s0024-3795(01)00487-6|pub.1023348810|38;[Svalbe, Imants]|[ur.01200347405.36]|Discrete Applied Mathematics|2004|139|1-3|265-281|10.1016/j.dam.2002.11.005|pub.1030578710|10;[Svalbe, Imants; Kingston, Andrew]|[ur.01200347405.36; ur.01022567614.71]|Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics|2003|12||154-165|10.1016/s1571-0653(04)00482-2|pub.1046375036|9;[Matus, F.; Flusser, J.]|[ur.014356036053.38; ur.01065304627.40]|IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|1993|15|10|996-1006|10.1109/34.254058|pub.1061155928|145;[Beylkin, G.]|[ur.016177613765.89]|IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|1987|35|2|162-172|10.1109/tassp.1987.1165108|pub.1061520106|301"

Let me start by stating that in the past year ITMB, a successful map publisher in British Columbia, Canada published more paper map titles than at any time in their history. Similarly, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recently announced that they have ceased producing paper from their aerial photography archive and will only produce digital copies. I believe that both of these facts speak to the future of maps and digital data. It means there will be paper maps well into the future and there will be an increasing array of digital data - some of it reformatted, as in the USGS case, and most of it will be born digital. When asked to speak about GIS and its role in libraries I often find myself in a conundrum - am I here to slay the dragon, or to pet the dragon. The role of technology in libraries is not one that has been embraced by everyone, and often the technology itself seems to have been force-fed upon us. The library profession is not one that has historically been a proponent of change and the very nature of GIS is change. In one sense, we have been given the choice of becoming paper museums or, at the very least, making GIS technology available in our collections. Today, I would like to review the many ways that GIS is, or will, affect our collections. I will divide the presentation into a general overview of GIS in libraries, how it affects our acquisitions or collection development policies, its effect on cataloging, on reference services, staffing, and our web services.

Several studies have shown that it is not possible to equate possession and use. A number of access models or frameworks designed to judge whether or not a person has access to the ICTs do exist. However, it is my opinion that there is a deficiency in these models; they do not start out from the individual user’s prerequisites, but rather judge the external conditions available for possible access. Assisted by four empirical studies, interviews and questionnaires, a number of access barriers experienced by the users have been identified. The studies show that in addition to the technological hindrances, a series of more elusive ones also exist originating from prevailing norms and values in the environment the user lives in. The barriers are categorised into five groups: to have, to be able, to will, to may and to dare. Together these notions form the User Centred Access Model, UCAM, which is suggested for use in charting and communicating the necessary considerations that must be taken into account in the development of Public Information Systems aimed for e-governmental issues.",IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,2006,223,,445-455,"Nilsson, Olof",Mid Sweden University,Sweden,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1040950985,0,"[Kvasny, Lynette; Trauth, Eileen M.]|[ur.012613150205.25; ur.07421642022.90]|IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|2003|110||273-291|10.1007/978-0-387-35634-1_14|pub.1001667144|19;[Popper, Karl R.; Eccles, John C.]|[ur.015402116117.04; ]||1977||||10.1007/978-3-642-61891-8|pub.1006241923|1657;[Gurstein, Michael; Clement, Andrew; Shade, Leslie R.]|[; ur.01204320102.19; ur.07604737473.51]|Community Informatics|2000|||32-51|10.4018/978-1-878289-69-8.ch002|pub.1021193211|58;[van Dijk, Jan; Hacker, Kenneth]|[; ]|The Information Society|2003|19|4|315-326|10.1080/01972240309487|pub.1047421245|730;[Science Institute, Informing]|[ur.015774355540.59]|Informing Science|2002|5||113-114|10.28945/541|pub.1092399669|1;[Carveth, Rod; B.

There is no lack of information on healthy lifestyles, but the manner of communication of risk and the level of support for lifestyle change need improvement, especially among deprived populations. Assisting vulnerable persons to increase their health knowledge could help them to be more responsible for maintaining their health. The Internet offers potential for interactivity by providing a dynamic medium for influencing learning and behaviour change, especially in so far as it enables inter-subjective communication among peers. This paper examines how the Internet might help tackle health inequalities by improving communication of risk and providing support for those who are most susceptible to changing their behaviour. The authors provide a descriptive account of whether facilitated access to the Internet may improve the capacity of older men to manage their heart conditions. Nine men aged 50 to 74 living in multiply deprived areas of Salford were given computers, Internet access and training for six months. Interviews and qualitative data were collected to assess the influence the Internet had on the management of their heart conditions before they were given the computers, after six months and three years after they were introduced to the Internet. The study was exploratory but its results suggest that interactive learning is worthwhile because it can help strengthen social support and influence behaviour change. Home access to the Internet via their own personal computer had a beneficial influence in building confidence and facilitating healthy behaviour change. Although less than half of the participants had ever used the Internet before the study, the majority of them reported using the Internet and email regularly after their involvement in the project.",Information Communication & Society,2007,10,1,95-114,"Lindsay, Sally;

pub.1042253164,10.1057/9780230595613_10,The Political Economy of Informational Development: A Normative Appraisal,"The rapid advances in information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the past three decades, acting in tandem with the globalisation of trade and investment, have brought about unprecedented changes in the global economy. The discovery of ‘knowledge’1 as the most important ingredient of all modern economies, surpassing land, labour and capital, has profoundly affected the modes of global economic production as well as consumption. Unleashing an array of new products and services for which usability was mostly invented, and reviving the productivity potential inherent in several advanced sectors of the economy by the deployment and diffusion of ICTs, represents the key factor behind this transformation. In advanced countries where ICTs have become part of the economic infrastructure, firms and business organisations, regardless of their size or spatial-temporal location, have experienced steep decline in transportation, communication, search and distribution costs (Guha, 2003). That is, the development and diffusion of ICTs have become a source of comparative advantage of nations (James, 2001). The assumption, until now, that the standard Heckscher-Ohlin model of international trade where comparative advantages in factor and resource endowments held sway has been replaced by the comparative advantage driven by international differences in production functions due to innovation and rapid technological change (Krugman, 1995). The advances in ICTs and related technologies have given rise to a new form of comparative advantage and international division of labour in the global economy. These economic changes may be collectively identified as ‘informational development’ because of the centrality of knowledge as codified information through the mediation of ICTs. Informational development is a complex and uneven process of economic change due to the dialectical relationship between the global–local forces and factors that underpin its shaping. It has spawned a host of normative and equity questions.","Technology, Globalization and Development",2005,,,196-217,"Parayil, Govindan",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1042253164,2,

The heavily populated areas on the Eastern seaboard, including all of the six state capitals have advanced ICT capability and infrastructure and Australians readily adopt new technologies. However, there is recognition of a digital divide which corresponds with the “great dividing” mountain range separating the sparsely populated arid interior from the populated coastal regions (Trebeck, 2000). A common theme in political commentary is that Australians are “over-governed” with three levels of government, federal, state, and local. Many of the citizens living in isolated regions would say “over-governed” and “underserviced.” Most of the state and local governments, “… have experienced difficulties in managing the relative dis-economies of scale associated with their small and often scattered populations.” Rural and isolated regions are the first to suffer cutbacks in government services in periods of economic stringency. (O’Faircheallaigh, Wanna, & Weller, 1999, p. 98). Australia has, in addition to the Commonwealth government in Canberra, two territory governments, six state governments, and about 700 local governments. All three levels of government, federal, state, and local, have employed ICTs to address the “tyranny of distance” (Blainey, 1967), a term modified and used for nearly 40 years to describe the isolation and disadvantage experienced by residents in remote and regional Australia. While the three levels of Australian governments have been working co-operatively since federation in 1901 with the federal government progressively increasing its power over that time, their agencies and departments generally maintain high levels of separation; the Queensland Government Agent Program is the exception.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1120-1124,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Kelso, R.",Central Queensland University,Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1041130542,0,

How can the Internet help developing nations and their disadvantaged in particular? Those who lobby in favour of rural ICT believe that Internet is not just a means of communication but is also an enabler of livelihood in rural areas and therefore, power. For a very long time now, the developing world has carried the burden of colonization and slavery. This has resulted in a lack of confidence among developing economies and the belief that they are not at par with the rest of the world. The lack of ""access"" has curtailed their ability to compete. In fact, ingenuity and hard work hasn't been adequate for one to enjoy economic and social benefit. In order to acquire these benefits, access to resources like education, health and employment become critical. Internet has been a boon in this regard. Today, one can be in the remotest corner of the world and as long as there is access to Internet enjoy access to education, health and resources. This allows them to compete and use their ingenuity and hard work to bring about a significant difference to their lives. This paper concentrates on how ICT can affect the lives of rural people in the developing world. The total rural population of the developing world is about 3.5 billion, with their average per capita income being no more than $200 per year. India, with 700 million rural people located in 600,000 villages, is a reflection of the developing world. The key issue that is addressed in the paper is whether technology can bring about a difference in the lives of people who earn less than half a dollar a day. Can health and education be made available to them? Can they afford the Internet? And ultimately, can it significantly enhance their livelihoods and income?",The Journal of Community Informatics,2004,1,1,,"Jhunjhunwala, Ashok; Ramachandran, Anuradha; Bandyopadhyay, Alankar",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133390058,19,
pub.1093727364,10.1109/auswireless.2007.27,"Analogy of Promising Wireless Technologies on Different Frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX","The explosive growth of the Internet over the last decade has led to an increasing demand for high-speed, ubiquitous Internet access. Broadband wireless technologies are increasingly gaining popularity by the successful global deployment of the wireless personal area networks (Bluetooth-IEEE 802.15.1), wireless local area networks (WiFi- IEEE 802.lln), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WiMAX- IEEE 802.16). New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called ""full mobility"" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds. This paper presents the analogy of promising wireless technologies on different frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX. This paper is organised into four parts: part I describes the functionality and usage of Bluetooth in the wireless personal area networks, part II presents the WiFi- IEEE 802.1 In strategies for users considering higher-bandwidth alternatives to existing wireless personal area networks, part III discusses how the WiMAX is used as a current standard for Wireless data transmission technology, which is optimized to deliver high, bursty data rates to mobile subscribers, and to support real-time multimedia and Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, and part-TV explores how these emerging Wireless technologies differ from one another.",The 2nd International Conference on Wireless Broadband and Ultra Wideband Communications (AusWireless 2007),2007,,,14-14,"Dhawan, S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1093727364,31,

Today every policy initiative and strategy formulated by the government and private sectors, be it Broadband policy, e-governance, triple play, expanding telemedicine capabilities, distance education, computing grid for research and development or digital entertainment, assumes a robust, high speed and end- to-end connectivity infrastructure. Though there has been a considerable growth of telecom in India over the past few years and a sizeable infrastructure has already been developed, in a vast country like India this touches only a smaller proportion of the population and the geographic spread. Last miles are still a problem area for many operators owing to lack of economic viability. Therefore, Innovative and non-conventional alternatives are to be explored for infrastructure expansion. Convergence of power and telecom infrastructures is viewed, world-over, as a viable alternative to address rapid expansion and better reach. Power transmission networks being the most pervasive and readily available network, are already being exploited as ready infrastructures for overlaying telecom networks (fiber networks). While the present level of infrastructure convergence Is more on the backbone network side (use of Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) on power transmission infrastructure), innovative concepts such as Broadband over Power Line (BPL) unleashes a truly powerful convergence enabling delivery of high speed telecom bandwidth to home on existing power sockets thus promising not only a networked home but an intelligent power utility grid too. With the concept of BPL, power infrastructure provides an end-to-end infrastructure to build telecom highways and tributaries as well. This paper discusses the potential of power-telecom convergence in addressing the backbone, middle mile and last mile needs of telecom and also dwells on upcoming concept of BPL and the challenges posed.",IETE Technical Review,2005,22,5,367-372,"Santhosh, Jayashree; Nair, Santhosh S; Jayasankar, M N",Power Grid Corporation (India),India,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1049995008,0,

It is our view that spiritual support is more important in medical care, while so-called high technology may be necessary for medical practice. Therefore, we proposed the concept of the Hyper Hospital [1–3], to offer patients a means of effective human communication during medical care. The Hyper Hospital is a medical system constructed on a computer and multimedia based-network, which patients use to participate in medical and care activities through improved communication media. It is sometimes difficult for physically handicapped patients, such as PMD (progressive muscular dystrophy), ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and traumatic cervical injury patients, to operate a computer, because of their disabilities. Therefore, there is a serious digital divide between physically disabled patients and healthy people. To remedy this, various communication devices, such as those using winking, eye gaze, voice, and electrical biological signals (event-related potential [4–5], electrooculogram, etc.) have been proposed and tested. These are designed to enable seriously handicapped patients to use a computer without using the usual mechanical input devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, or joystick. Although an EEG (electroencephalogram) offers one source of such potential electrical biological signals, it produces a very weak electrical signal that contaminating noise makes difficult to process. On the other hand, the ocular potential generated by the dipolar potential of the eyeball has a much larger gain in potential than the EEG. Moreover, the ocular potential can be easily controlled by the user, and eye-movement ability remains largely intact, even after neurological diseases progress to a very advanced stage. Therefore, this report studied the development of an input interface for computers using an electrooculogram.",Advances in Bioengineering,2001,,,197-198,"Mizuno, F.; Harada, A.; Yamaguchi, T.",Nagoya Institute of Technology,Japan,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143070080,0,

Information society, information network, and digital divide are terms inducted in very recent days. The key element in this periphery, is the information, and it is the easy and free flow of information to the demand routes. Because of the information-based nature of the modern economy, the globalization of the telecommunication industry, and the interdependent global environment, the value of the global network grows and more users are interlinked. The information society is driven by information, similar to the industrial society. This society is produced by a reliance on information as the most significant factor in the terms of production. Hence, it relies on the information economy to produce products, services, employment, wealth, and lifestyle on which the community depends. Ultimately the whole community of a country can be benefited by optimum utilization of information to be flown into each territory of the society. Given the right incubation, a community based information network molded by information can accelerate the pace of development. Rapid advancements and convergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs) have a deep and far-ranging impact on economic, social, and political life. The increase in the speed of and variations in communication flows is catalyzing an unprecedented growth in the exchange of ideas, goods, and services. Government, organizations and businesses that ignore this development and lag behind in adaptation risk themselves becoming uncompetitive, marginalized and out of the game (ABDI, 2002). Efforts have been given to accommodate propositions on fabricating nationwide information networks through utilization of the existing information backbones especially in developing countries, and a centrally driven content repository may eventually be established.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,201-207,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Rahman, H.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1012639613,2,

A total of 90 urban impoverished women homeworkers and 40 sectoral stakeholders were interviewed. They are from different races, ages and types of home‐based work and included the chronically ill or those with physically and mentally challenged dependents. Focus group discussions, oral histories and case studies/observations offer insights of gender issues and glimpses into their otherwise invisible lives. Most homeworkers were initially ‘greened’ as ‘unskilled’ workers or cheap secondary labour in the mushrooming industries. They subsequently withdrew and entered home‐based work after marriage and childbirth. Many were spatially confined by their religious and traditional sense of duty and their responsibility to their family, especially disabled children. Others were restricted by their immobility in a disable unfriendly environment. Homeworking enables them to be economically productive and empowers them. However, due to their isolation, atomization, lack of recognition as ‘workers’ and inadequate safeguards to protect their welfare, many homeworkers, subcontracting from factories or selling through middlepersons, suffer from exploitation. Many assistance schemes of the Malaysian Government for vulnerable groups do not target homeworkers. Its heavy investment in ICT infrastructure has yet to narrow the digital divide. While all homeworkers have access to some form of ICT tools, many do not personally own the tools. Fewer have access to computer and Internet. Although they are aware of the potential of ICT for work, few explore its full potential because of their limited education, lack of literacy or their inability to demystify technology. Those supported by organisations have better access to training and utilize ICT tools in varying degrees for their work. They increase their clientele and widen their markets. With greater gender justice, these homeworkers will be able to transform gender relations and technology issues to be empowered to gain knowledge and use ICTs to access wider markets, skills and opportunities and uplift their lives and that of their families.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2007,32,1,1-14,"Loh‐Ludher, Lee Lee",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099630363,7,"[Standing, Guy]|[]|World Development|1989|17|7|1077-1095|10.1016/0305-750x(89)90170-8|pub.1045749766|410;[]|[]|Choice|1992|29|07|29-4214-29-4214|10.5860/choice.29-4214|pub.1073309827|187"

This study looks at policymakers’ dissemination of a National Cancer Institute (NCI) Web-based, preventive health education intervention to low-income people in Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado through free Internet access. Although free public access Internet telecenters would appear to offer the potential of bridging these gaps, knowledge and information gaps persist because of the differentials between free and pay Internet access, as well as access through direct personal ownership of computers with Internet connections. The rate of increase of knowledge diffusion is much higher for individuals and communities of higher socioeconomic status who pay for access than for those with lesser means and who access free electronic resources. Pay-for-Internet cybercafes and free Internet telecenters have different accessibility thresholds, offer different user environments, and attract at least two different types of customers or clients. The socioeconomic differences in the two types of patrons are presented in this study by way of the results of an electronic user survey and a telecenter survey in the aforementioned project locales. While a learning and knowledge gap is evident between patrons of pay and free access sites, both types of public Internet access are, in relative terms, severely limited. Residually, a large knowledge gap persists among users of public access sites compared to computer owners with their own Internet connections. These disparities have implications for the dissemination of Web-based health information, particularly among the poor in minority communities. The Internet access evaluation is placed in the larger context of the NCI project, the Health Communication Intervention Research Initiative, looking (1) at broader concerns of cultural communications and policy and program implementation (2) across social and programmatic networks, with consideration to (3) pedagogical applications of the case in the MPA classroom.",Journal of Public Affairs Education,2006,12,2,213-232,"Medina, Una E.; Rivera, Mario A.; Rogers, Everett M.; Woodall, W.

pub.1020520372,10.1007/978-3-7091-3707-9_31,Flat panel detectors — closing the (digital) gap in chest and skeletal radiology,"In the radiological department today the majority of all X-ray procedures on chest and skeletal radiography is performed with classical film-screen-systems.Using digital luminescence radiography (DLR or CR, which stands for computed radiography) as a technique has shown a way to replace this 100 year old procedure of doing general radiography work by acquiring the X-rays digitally via phosphor screens. But this approach has faced criticism from lots of radiologists world wide and therefore hasn’t been widely accepted except in the intensive care environment.A new technology is now rising based on the use of so called flat panel X-ray (FD) detectors. Semiconducting material detects the X-rays in digital form directly and creates an instantaneous image for display, distribution and diagnosis. This ability combined with a large field of view and — compared to existing methods — excellent detective quantum efficiency represents a revolutionary step for chest and skeletal radiography and will put basic X-ray-work back into the focus of radiological solutions.This paper will explain the basic technology of flat panel detectors, possible system solutions based on this new technology, aspects of the user interface influencing the system utilization and versatility as well as the possibility to redefine the patient examination process for chest and skeletal radiography.Furthermore the author discusses limitations for the first released systems, upgrades for the installed base and possible scenarios for the future, e.g. fluoroscopy or angiography application.",Digital (R)Evolution in Radiology,2001,,,289-295,"Reiff, K.

pub.1100908271,10.21825/af.v20i1-2.5073,Development and Maintenance of the Ethiopian Legal Information Website,"Information and Communication Technology in general and the internet in particular have been creating unprecedented opportunities in facilitating and streamlining access to information. Websites have become a common way of publishing legal information for the public in many countries. In Ethiopia, however, the availability of legal websites has been very limited or non-existent. Except for the constitution, no other basic Ethiopian law has ever been published online. To benefit from the tremendous potentials of the internet, a project was initiated to develop an Ethiopian Legal Information Web Site.Based on users' requirements obtained from questionnaire analysis, and current paradigms and implications, the Ethiopian Legal Information Website was designed, developed, implemented and maintained. The website is an online database of Ethiopian basic laws developed by Mekelle University, Ethiopia, in cooperation with the Non-Western Law Department of Ghent University, Belgium.Basic laws included on the site at present are the Ethiopian Constitution, Civil Code, Criminal Code, Civil Procedure Code, Criminal Procedure Code, Commercial Code and Family Code. The laws can be viewed and used in full text html, whereas some of the laws including the 2004 Criminal Code, Family Code, FDKE Constitution and the Tigray Regional State Constitution are available in pdf Laws can be searched by keywords using the site search engine. Comments and suggestions from experts and Ethiopian laws users have been collected, hence modifications, improvements and additions have been made to the website. The Ethiopian Legal Information Website was first hosted on the University of Ghent internet server and currently in the Mekelle University server at http://mail.mu.edu. et/~ethiopialaws/.1 The Ethiopian Legal Information Website has been found to be a useful web portal to access and use the basic Ethiopian laws. The University of Ghent, ILO, the Library of Congress, AUSTLII, WASHLAW, WIKIPEDIA and other major legal web portals make citations in reference to the site. While the website currently contains only the basic laws of the federal government, an action plan is prepared to include regional laws of Ethiopia. Other legal information including amendments to the laws, decisions and legal news will also be included on the site, hence a comprehensive Ethiopian Legal Web Portal will be developed and maintained.

pub.1002158772,10.1002/asi.20742,Subjectivity and information ethics1,"In “A Brief History of Information Ethics,” Thomas Froehlich (2004) quickly surveyed under several broad categories some of the many issues that constitute information ethics: under the category of librarianship—censorship, privacy, access, balance in collections, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics; under information science, which Froehlich sees as closely related to librarianship—confidentiality, bias, and quality of information; under computer ethics—intellectual property, privacy, fair representation, nonmaleficence, computer crime, software reliability, artificial intelligence, and e‐commerce; under cyberethics (issues related to the Internet, or “cyberspace”)—expert systems, artificial intelligence (again), and robotics; under media ethics—news, impartiality, journalistic ethics, deceit, lies, sexuality, censorship (again), and violence in the press; and under intercultural information ethics—digital divide, and the ethical role of the Internet for social, political, cultural, and economic development. Many of the debates in information ethics, on these and other issues, have to do with specific kinds of relationships between subjects. The most important subject and a familiar figure in information ethics is the ethical subject engaged in moral deliberation, whether appearing as the bearer of moral rights and obligations to other subjects, or as an agent whose actions are judged, whether by others or by oneself, according to the standards of various moral codes and ethical principles. Many debates in information ethics revolve around conflicts between those acting according to principles of unfettered access to information and those finding some information offensive or harmful. Subjectivity is at the heart of information ethics. But how is subjectivity understood? Can it be understood in ways that broaden ethical reflection to include problems that remain invisible when subjectivity is taken for granted and when how it is created remains unquestioned? This article proposes some answers by investigating the meaning and role of subjectivity in information ethics.2 In an article on cyberethics (2000), I asserted that there was no information ethics in any special sense beyond the application of general ethical principles to information services.

pub.1022656591,10.1108/02640470610689197,Development of a web‐based self‐training package for information retrieval using the distance education approach,"The purpose of this project was to develop a web‐based self‐training package for information retrieval using the distance education approach. The package was developed using the distance education approach with STOU Plan, STOU Plan 2000 and GMS‐VU applied. The distance education model for the web‐based self‐training package was composed of five stages: identifying the learners, design of the package, production of the package, establishing the delivery system, and evaluation. The system development methodology was based on the system development lifecycle (SDLC) with a combination of waterfall, phased and prototyping approaches. There are several phase in SDLC to carry out: problem and objective identification, requirement determination, requirement analysis, package design, package implementation, delivery system and evaluation. Evaluation of the package was conducted in two phases: formative evaluation and summative evaluation using the focus group discussion method. Formative evaluation was conducted during the package development by experts in the field prior to the summative evaluation. The summative evaluation was conducted after the package development had been completed as a pilot study for field trial by target users, consisting of junior library staff and library users. All comments were reviewed and refined in terms of instructional content, design, overall opinion and learning progress before put on production. The package consists of three main components: About the project, Study modules, References and further readings. Study modules, which is the most important component, consists of ten instructional modules focusing on information retrieval, and self‐assessment through pre‐test and post‐test. The package includes multimedia such as images and sound to attract learners during their learning session. The delivery mode for the self‐training package offers both online and off‐line modes. Online mode is offered when there is network facility and internet connection available, while offline mode is offered through CD‐ROM without requiring network and internet connection. The features and functions of both modes are identical. Moreover, print materials are also included as supplementary media. Since the module is a self‐directed learning or self‐training tool in information retrieval it can be employed for junior library staff and library users; it provides a training tool for librarians to train library users and supports human resource and development to narrow digital divides and support the right to access information.",The Electronic Library,2006,24,4,501-516,"Sacchanand, Chutima; Jaroenpuntaruk, Vipa",Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University,Thailand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1022656591,11,"[RIGGS, DONALD E.]|[]|College & Research Libraries|1997|58|3|208-209|10.5860/crl.58.3.208|pub.1007174750|6;[Vishwanatham, Rama; Wilkins, Walter; Jevec, Thomas]|[ur.014250541367.81; ; ur.013623556307.28]|College & Research Libraries|1997|58|5|433-444|10.5860/crl.58.5.433|pub.1008755769|14;[Cavanagh, Anthony K.]|[ur.07666002763.43]|Journal of Library Administration|2001|31|3-4|149-166|10.1300/j111v31n03_13|pub.1012867961|3;[Stoker, David]|[]|Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|1995|27|1|3-5|10.1177/096100069502700101|pub.1018539580|3;[Peters, Otto]|[]|Open Learning The Journal of Open Distance and e-Learning|1989|4|3|3-8|10.1080/0268051890040302|pub.1021594670|39;[Dhanarajan, Gajaraj]|[ur.015125240653.54]|Open Learning The Journal of Open Distance and e-Learning|2001|16|1|61-68|10.1080/02680510124465|pub.1023891966|36;[DRAGULANESCU, NICOLAE-GEORGE]|[ur.015340644563.92]|The International Information & Library Review|2002|34|3|247-254|10.1006/iilr.2002.0205|pub.1035224732|46;[Brown, Cecelia M.]|[ur.011770560463.97]|College & Research Libraries|1999|60|5|426-438|10.5860/crl.60.5.426|pub.1039988065|28;[Caspers, Jean; Fritts, Jack; Gover, Harvey]|[ur.013323271061.37; ; ur.013005662745.51]|Journal of Library Administration|2001|31|3-4|127-148|10.1300/j111v31n03_12|pub.1041274300|5;[Sacchanand, Chutima]|[ur.011717531261.13]|IFLA Journal|1999|25|2|97-100|10.1177/034003529902500206|pub.1046231319|2;[Casey, Des]|[]|ACM SIGCSE Bulletin|1998|30|3|51-54|10.1145/290320.283018|pub.1048985704|4"

At present, the contributing boosting factors of “Informatization” are realized through both supply and demand components; namely, the expansion of Information Technology, widespread use of the Internet, and the introduction of re-engineering, mainly by corporate enterprises of developed countries. “Informatization” will ultimately resolve into a network society which will run close to a “perfect marketplace”, where information is passed on instantly-ignoring the time/space constraint-at low cost. As a result, intermediary business agents that evolved from the information gap as an added-value will lose existence value, and hence disappear, while optimization of global procurement of materials and components will be made possible, thereby, increasing efficiency in procurement and sales. Furthermore, consumer lifestyles will change. Therefore, companies are expected to face up to the evolution of a network society and approach business expansion accordingly. The biggest problem facing the network society is the digital divide. Moreover, a new type of Information Appliance is in demand for this network society-one with easy operation along with high quality network capability and digital security-which will take over the role of personal computers. In Japan, as part of corporate reform strategies, investment in IT is in full swing. In fact, IT investment is said to be the driving force behind Japan's capital investment. In addition to IT investments by corporate enterprises, “informatization” is accelerated by widespread use of the Internet, and furthermore, new stock exchange markets have been set up, all resulting in the emergence of Internet-related entrepreneurs in Japan. This phenomenon is expected to stimulate the industry and economy of Japan, which has been suffering from post-bubble stagnation. Yet on the other hand, “Internet-bubble” is a new phrase that has emerged up recently, indicating that this may end up as a one-off trend. “Informatization” itself is irreversible; therefore, deregulation, for example, is needed to encourage further entrepreneurs entering the market, and appropriate management of the newly opening stock market is expected, all in an effort to stop this becoming a one-off boom. The future of 21st century Japan depends on whether or not Japan can adapt into the network society.

pub.1050821935,10.1108/14684520510628909,Revolutionising the voting process through online strategies,"Purpose To provide practitioners of information management with an overview and framework to explore the various controversies associated with the methods of traditional methods of voting with electronically enhanced voting via the internet (I‐voting). The current paper is centered on the assumption that I‐voting is the next logical step in applying online information‐gathering and retrieval technologies to the field of e‐government.   Design/methodology/approach A review of the applied literature on electronically enhanced voting methods with potentials associated with internet voting, as well as from practical experience, resulted in a basic model for discussion of the emergent nature of I‐voting.   Findings I‐voting would reduce the cost for staffing polling stations, and also the funds needed to pay for voting machines. I‐voting could also reduce the number of errors made by both the voters and the electoral administrators, and allow for easier adoption of uniform standards in the ballot format, since it could be transmitted via the internet from a central election agency to all local and regional polling places. Bridging the digital divide and internet security issues may be the most important barriers that must be overcome if I‐voting becomes a viable option in the USA.   Research limitations/implications It may be years, if ever, before a truly secure, relatively risk‐free internet service, such as I‐voting, is developed. However, despite the controversies associated with election fraud, the numerous current voting systems that are in place suffer from the same problems associated with online informational exchanges; but, for the most part, nations still conduct their businesses and the political systems are still relatively stable.   Practical implications Owing to recent voting débâcles in the USA, the public is demanding a more reliable and secure method of voting. Currently, many nations are moving more toward electronically enhanced voting methods with the long‐term goal being internet voting. Unfortunately, there are heated debates about the pros and cons of handing over the right to vote, using a system that is prone to security risks from outside sources.   Originality/value In the short term, there should be increased interest in establishing national and international standards for testing and certification of electronic and I‐voting systems and their IT‐infrastructure. It is a basic premise of the present study that voting online increases voter participation, which can only be viewed in a positive light.",Online Information Review,2005,29,5,513-530,"Smith, Alan D.; Clark, John S.",Robert Morris University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050821935,12,"[Gefen, David; Rose, Gregory M.; Warkentin, Merrill; Pavlou, Paul A.]|[ur.010724440512.07; ur.012601410205.94; ur.014404213724.32; ur.016166254325.43]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|54-78|10.4018/jgim.2005010103|pub.1003512069|111;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Information Management & Computer Security|2002|10|4|178-183|10.1108/09685220210436976|pub.1007192953|49;[GIBSON, RACHEL]|[]|Political Science Quarterly|2001|116|4|561-583|10.2307/798221|pub.1010471932|62;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Services Marketing Quarterly|2003|25|1|47-74|10.1300/j396v25n01_04|pub.1025419024|4;[Rubin, Aviel D.]|[ur.01202677520.79]|Communications of the ACM|2002|45|12|39-44|10.1145/585597.585599|pub.1030184287|80;[Kawalek, Peter; Wastall, David]|[ur.010652275447.99; ur.010150047173.08]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|79-101|10.4018/jgim.2005010104|pub.1032524137|30;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Information Management & Computer Security|2002|10|2|64-72|10.1108/09685220210424113|pub.1033775264|41;[Smith, Alan D.; Rupp, William T.]|[ur.015062661765.66; ur.016455622765.36]|Services Marketing Quarterly|2004|25|3|53-75|10.1300/j396v25n03_04|pub.1039409748|13;[Phillips, Deborah M.; von Spakovsky, Hans A.]|[; ]|Communications of the ACM|2001|44|1|73-ff.|10.1145/357489.357512|pub.1045705328|28;[Tan, Chee-Wee; Pan, Shan L.; Lim, Eric T.K.]|[ur.010575342171.01; ur.014246137254.98; ur.016667225543.30]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|31-53|10.4018/jgim.2005010102|pub.1047237663|89;[Grant, Gerald; Chau, Derek]|[ur.014437343351.01; ur.013304476217.26]|Journal of Global Information Management|2005|13|1|1-30|10.4018/jgim.2005010101|pub.1050886570|144"
pub.1007606834,10.1007/978-3-540-72990-7_4,Path Towards Network Convergence and Challenges,"The emerging trends in the market place are driving towards convergence at device, network, and application levels. Today consumers are looking for a single device capable of fulfilling their daily communication, computing, and personal productivity application needs. Businesses are working tirelessly to offer enhanced quality of service and application portability to consumers irrespective of their locality, mobility, and system preferences. These user preferences squarely challenge existence of stovepipe platforms, islands of interoperable systems, centralized command and control structure, and fragmented connectivity landscape. The new paradigm is all about being technology, platform, operating system, and network agnostic. There are clear indications, which confirms this transformation - e.g. connectivity migrating form circuit switched to packet switched, system resources and application transitioning from centralized to distributed (e.g. thin client, P2P), applications becoming platform and operating systems agnostic (e.g. Java applets), fixed and mobile convergence (IP centric - IMS), and aggregation of voice, data, and video (triple play).This paradigm shift brings challenges and opportunities to system developers and raises the threshold of entry. To become a successful player in this new world one needs to understand the full value chain of the new ecosystem. The existing base of deployed system, equipments, and hierarchies can’t be overhauled overnight due to business, political, and regulatory reasons and one need to work in the confine of these constraints. Coexistence and collaboration across the heterogeneous systems and platforms need to be evaluated and commonality across must be exploited. We have to take advantage of the recent advancements in VLSI, system integration, and signal processing technologies. The mobile industry has been in the forefront and enabler of this transformation. They have taken full advantage of Moore’s law in integrating myriad of complementary applications such as WLAN, BT, 3D gaming, GPS, camera, audio/video streaming, and personal productivity gadgets to name a few. And this all has been done under the constraints of the device size and battery power. It is no coincidence that today’s mobile device deliver the capabilities of PC of yester years.There has been a lot of progress already made towards the global convergence but more needs to be done. If current trend continues then there is a safe bet to say that today’s mobile evolution would be able to reduce the “digital divide” for the human kind globally.",Lecture Notes in Computer Science,2007,4516,,5-5,"Jha, Uma S.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1007606834,0,
pub.1000066419,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch202,Women in the Free/Libre Open Source Software Development,"Free/libre open source software (FLOSS) has become a prominent phenomenon in the ICT field and the wider public domain for the past years. However, according to a FLOSS survey on FLOSS developers in 2002, “women do not play a role in the [FLOSS] development; only 1.1% of the FLOSS sample is female.” (Ghosh, Glott, Krieger, & Robles, 2002). In the mainstream research on FLOSS communities, many researchers also overlook different processes of community-building and diverse experiences of members, and presume a stereotyped male-dominated “hacker community” (e.g., Levy, 1984; Raymond, 2001; Himanen, 2001; Thomas, 2002). Moreover, issues around gender inequality are often ignored and/or muted in the pile of FLOSS studies. Female programmers often are rejected ex/implicitly from the software labour market (Levesque & Wilson 2004). The requirements of female users are not respected and consulted either (European Commission, 2001). This feature is opposite to the FLOSS ideal world where users should be equally treated and embraced (op. cit.). While many researchers endeavour to understand the FLOSS development, few found a gender-biased situation problematic. In short, women are almost invisible in current FLOSS-related literature. Most policies targeting at advocating FLOSS are also gender blind. Thus, this essay highlights the need for increased action to address imbalances between women’s and men’s access to and participation in the FLOSS development in cultural (e.g., chauvinistic and/or gender-biased languages in discussions on mailing lists or in documentations), economic (e.g., unequal salary levels for women and men), political (e.g., male-dominated advocacy environment) and technical (e.g., unbalanced students gender in technical tutorials) spheres. On the other hand, it also emphasises the powerful potential of FLOSS as a vehicle for advancing gender equality in software expertise. FLOSS helps transport knowledge and experience of software engineering through distributing source code together with the binary code almost without any limit. Many FLOSS licences such as the General Public Licence (GPL) also facilitates the flow of information and knowledge. In other words, if appropriately harnessed, FLOSS stands to meaningfully contribute to and mutually reinforce the advancement of effective, more expedited solutions to bridging the gender digital divide. In the end, this article points out that while women in more advanced countries have a better chance of upgrading their ICT skills and knowledge through participating in the FLOSS development, the opportunity is less available for women in the developing world. It is worth noting that although the gender issues raised in this article are widespread, they should not be considered as universally indifferent. Regional specificities in gender agenda in software engineering should be addressed distinctly (UNDP/UNIFEM, 2004).",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,1286-1291,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Lin, Yuwei",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,Netherlands,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1000066419,7,

While many of these surveys emphasize the importance of technological issues, such as Web sites, interoperable data standards, and security protections, considerably less attention has been focused on the legislative environment that either facilitates or hinders the development of e-government at the national level. Like all countries, the United States has long grappled with the problem of how to centrally coordinate a diverse and sometimes incongruous collection of departments and agencies to achieve improved efficiencies, while maintaining a level of flexibility that enables these entities to carry out their specialized responsibilities effectively. This challenge can be made harder by the integration of information technology into government, by reifying organizational boundaries in the form of so-called “stove pipes” and “islands of automation.” To combat these problems, national governments are attempting to use legislative means to harmonize a cacophony of independent initiatives, and establish benchmarks for oversight. On December 17, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the E-Government Act of 2002 (116 Stat. 2899; P.L. 107-347) into law. Although there are many existing laws regarding issues such as information technology (IT) management, privacy, and information security, the E-Government Act of 2002 is the first national law that specifically addresses e-government in the United States. Prior to the passage of the E-Government Act, the law frequently cited as the most comprehensive information technology-related law was the Clinger-Cohen Act, signed into law in 1996, just 5 years after the development of the World Wide Web (1991) and at a time when the potential uses of the Internet were just beginning to be recognized by the larger, general public. The Clinger-Cohen Act provisions focus primarily on a narrow range of issues, including the decentralization of IT management within the U.S. federal government, pilot testing of new IT procurement procedures, and the establishment of chief information officer (CIO) positions in the major departments and agencies. In contrast, the provisions of the E-Government Act, described in greater detail below, address a much more comprehensive range of issues, suggesting that the integration of IT into government operations has reached a critical turning point. Some of these provisions include information security, IT management and training, the digital divide, and the creation of an Office of Electronic Government to coordinate and oversee e-government initiatives government-wide, among other duties.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,476-481,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Seifert, J.

pub.1037151393,10.1108/00242530610667585,Internet adoption amongst final year students in Ghana's oldest business school,"Purpose The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of awareness and utilisation of the internet for academic research and learning among level 400 (final year) students of Ghana's oldest business school.   Design/methodology/approach The study utilised a cross‐sectional survey approach because it was restricted to final year students in the 2003–2004 year graduating class. The study also employed a convenience sampling technique and was executed by means of questionnaire administration and personal interviews. The final year students were asked to fill the questionnaires before a business policy lecture. The basic research instrument used in this research was a structured questionnaire with both open and close ended questions. Apart from questionnaires, in‐depth interviews with the respondents were also conducted with the respondents because we felt that because we were dealing with a research that had to do with technology, there could be latent issues that could only be uncovered by open discussions. Data were analysed and presented by means of simple descriptive statistics.   Findings Developing countries, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa, are often rich in the resources of people and staffing, if not in material resources. The promotion of information literacy is essentially dependent on using people differently, that is to better effect, not on injecting more resourcing into under‐funded services (although this is also important in many regards). Authorities at teaching universities, including lecturers, and heads of departments, must, as a matter of urgency, adopt mechanisms for creating better information skills and internet usage awareness among the students. This should focus on what the internet is, the services available through the internet, and the basic skills required to use the internet. This policy is not limited by resourcing, it is simply a new way to better use the richest resource of developing nations, the people and their talents.   Research limitations/implications Owing to the exploratory nature of the research, the results cannot be generalised with certainty. The research however gives pointers to gaps in the internet use propensities of business students in Ghana's business school and an internet education policy has to be instituted immediately to properly prepare students for an increasingly online Ghanaian business environment.

pub.1139273782,10.29173/irie18,Information Rights: Trust and Human Dignity in e-Government,"The words - Rights, - Trust, - Human Dignity, - and even - Government - have widely varying meanings and connotations, differing across time, languages and cultures. Concepts of rights, trust, and human dignity have been examined for centuries in great depth by ethicists and other philosophers and by religious think-ers, and more recently by social scientists and, especially as related to information, by information scientists. Similarly, discussions of government are well documented in writings back to Plato and Aristotle, with investi-gations of electronic government (often referred to as e-government) dating back only to the early 1990s with the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web. At first e-government was described in glowing, positive terms. Little, if any, attention was paid to two critical questions: 1) Will people trust e-government? and 2) How will cultural differences affect individuals‘ trust in government and their perceptions of govern-ment‘s effect of their human dignity? Examinations of trust and distrust by individuals within organizations have addressed questions of motives and intentions, expectations of behavior, protection of interests, confi-dence in accuracy and reliability of information, vulnerability, and reciprocity, among other complex topics. Establishing e-government services often requires going through several phases: 1) publish (using ICT to improve access to government information), 2) interact (broadening participation in government through 2-way communications, and 3) transact (making actual services available online; and 4) transform (fundamen-tally changing government to make it truly citizen-centric). Building and maintaining trust in e-government require developing an understanding both of the many levels of interactions where trust must be earned and of cultural differences. Another challenge in developing such a framework is that e-government, itself, is very dynamic, changing rapidly over time. Trust in content or a system available one day may not carry over when the content and/or system changes dramatically. Components of a framework must include the follow-ing dimensions: conceptual domains, cultural dimensions, information content dimensions, and system di-mensions. Of course, these dimensions must be considered within the context of rapidly changing govern-ments, ICT services, the digital divide, and other factors. This paper provides a very brief overview of some of the notions of trust and distrust, concentrating on those concerning trust as it relates to notions of power, trust in organizations, and trust in information and information systems as one part of a framework to ad-dress the question of trust in e-government. It also makes a few recommendations for how to build citizen-centric e-government to ensure information rights through a focus on human dignity, fundamental human rights, and earning trust.",The International Review of Information Ethics,2007,7,,168-174,"Carbo, Toni",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139273782,5,

Findings of this survey would then be used to coin a national ICTs policy and the e‐strategy to provide a roadmap towards a knowledge society. In a quest to assess the country's e‐readiness the Harvard University Guide (HUG) was used. Development in this paper is referred to as a process of change, which sets in motion principles whose objective is to eradicate poverty, injustice and various forms of exploitation. The pursuit of development therefore becomes the central pillar for policies. This paper seeks to provide a critical analysis of Zimbabwe's e‐readiness survey report and also focuses on the bedrock upon which the survey was carried out. It seeks to perceive an imperative to the e‐readiness assessment as also hinged on the technological determinist perspective as propounded by Marshal McLuhan (1964). This theory will be compounded by the diffusion of innovations model as coined by Everett Rogers (1962). The model strongly emphasizes the adoption of new technologies as the panacea for social change and development. The argument posited by the e‐readiness survey report is that in order to bridge the digital gap, Zimbabwe needs to build infrastructure to allow ICTs to be accessible. However, the e‐readiness survey report does not show a connection between the spread of ICTs infrastructure on the one hand and the economic and social development on the other. There is need to consider non‐quantifiable variables, such as poverty and social justice. The other factor as suggested above is the need for Zimbabwe to address current political and economic problems, as this isolation would impact heavily on the need to be interconnected.",The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,2006,28,1,1-16,"Mhlanga, Brilliant",University of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099634010,7,"[Maddison, Simmon]|[]|Electronics Education|2002|2002|2|13-16|10.1049/ee.2002.0020|pub.1056749644|20;[Mudhai, Okoth Fred]|[ur.015566273615.55]|Ecquid Novi African Journalism Studies|2004|25|2|313-335|10.1080/02560054.2004.9653300|pub.1084541643|14;[Melkote, Srinivas; Steeves, H.]|[ur.014552667562.19; ur.016575264771.18]||2001||||10.4135/9788132113751|pub.1099297880|194;[]|[]|America Calling|1992||||10.1525/9780520915008|pub.1135926927|389"

Resulting from the last decades’ considerable developments towards a global information society, the demand for a qualified IT workforce has increased. The integration of information technology into the different sectors of every day life is increasing the need for large numbers of IT professionals. Additionally, the need for nearly all workers to have general computing skills suggests possibilities for an individual to face inequality or suffer from displacement in modern society if they lack these skills, further contributing to the digital divide. Thus, the importance of IT education has a greater importance than ever for the whole of society. Despite the advances and mass adoption of new technologies, IT and computing education continually suffers from low participant numbers, and high dropout and transfer rates. This problem has been somewhat addressed by introducing mentoring programs (von Hellens, Nielsen, Doyle, & Greenhill, 1999) where a student is given a support person, a mentor, who has a similar education background but has graduated and is employed in industry. Although the majority of these programs have been considered successful, it is important to note that it is difficult to easily measure success in this context. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to mentoring which was adopted as part of an ongoing, traditional-type mentoring program in a large Australian university. The approach involved introducing modern communications technology, specifically mobile phones having an integrated camera and the capability to make use of multimedia messaging services (MMS). As mobile phones have become an integrated part of our everyday life (with high adoption rates) and are an especially common media of communication among young people, it was expected that the use of the phones could be easily employed to the mentoring program (phones were provided for the participants). Short message service (SMS), for example text messaging, has become a frequently used communication channel (Grinter & Eldridge 2003). In addition to text, photo sharing has also quickly taken off with MMS capable mobile phones becoming more widespread. The ability to exchange photos increases the feeling of presence (Counts & Fellheimer, 2004), and the possibility to send multimedia messages with mobile phones has created a new form of interactive storytelling (Kurvinen, 2003). Cole and Stanton (2003) found the pictorial information exchange as a potential tool for children’s collaboration during their activities in story telling, adventure gaming and for field trip tasks. Encouraged by these experiences, we introduced mobile mentoring as part of a traditional mentoring program, and present the experiences. It is hoped that these experiences can affirm the legitimacy of phone mentoring as a credible approach to mentoring. The positive and negative experiences presented in this article can help to shape the development of future phone mentoring programs.",Encyclopedia of Human Computer Interaction,2006,,,680-685,"Ghaoui, Claude; Häkkilä, Jonna; Beekhuyzen, Jenine",University of Oulu; Griffith University,Finland; Australia,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1003018299,0,

The information society has changed the rules of interactions between people and organisations, increasing the power of individuals. The specific characteristics of the Internet permit freedom of expression and interaction, to a level unmatched by the traditional channel of communications. As the use of the Internet became more spread in the society, the governments understood that it is risky and ineffective to ignore the possibilities provided by online information and communication. Since the Internet cannot be controlled by any single institution, the only possibility to influence public opinion is to participate in online exchanges. From this perspective, the Internet can be defined as a highly democratic media channel, which allows not only one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many communication, but also the storage and retrieval of historical data. On the other hand, Internet communication can improve the efficiency of various administrative operations and reduce costs. E-government tends to be multidimensional, impacting above all on economic, social and governance dimensions. The benefits of introducing online system in the area of government and public administration are many and varied, such as: cost-effective delivery of services, improved revenue collection on taxes and service levies; IT literacy and reduction of the internal digital divide; increased access to and quality of education; improved education management capacity; improved social security; improved social welfare; integration and coordination of social and economic policy; improved public safety and security; increased capacity for a rational distribution of public funds (geographically and among population groups); greater accountability and transparency in public administration; better coordination and cooperation among government agencies and among different levels of government; improved public relations and communications; increased awareness of rights of civil society and obligations of government; greater public participation in governments’ affairs (United Nations, 2003). The implementation and effective co-ordination of e-government systems is complex and difficult, requiring knowledge and substantial resources. The implementation process will be most probably influenced by the level of economic development of every country, as well as by the political agenda of the ruling party. From this perspective, there might be significant differences between the developed economies that have a stable democratic system, and the developing countries, or the economies in transition. These countries, some of them with a fairly developed financial and technological infrastructure, experience specific conditions in terms of knowledge, technological abilities, IT market, telecommunication infrastructure, and regulations. Many of these countries are presently attempting to transform a traditional economy, into an e-society in which Internet communication and interaction pays a central role.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1000-1005,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Gurau, C.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047746058,1,

The United Nations (U.N.) Development Program (UNDP, 2001) defines ICTs in terms of innovations in microelectronics, computing (hardware and software), telecommunications and opto-electronics—micro-processors, semiconductors and fibre optics. These technologies enable the processing and storage of enormous amounts and rapid distribution of information through communications networks. As new innovations, ICTs are also described as “the building blocks of the networked world,” (UNDP, 2001, p. 30), with ICTs, particularly the Internet, being used by a variety of organizations as a global networking tool. Access to, knowledge of and effective use of ICTs is crucial, particularly where access to the technology is equated to social, political, economic and human development. Internet usage, for example, is regarded as the standard indicator of the use of ICTs and also the most democratic of all mass media, mainly because of their low investment (Internet World Stats, 2006). This technology has been used effectively as a tool for delivery of various services and applications, including distance learning, agriculture, telehealth, e-commerce and e-governance. Individuals, organizations and institutions now use the Internet to strategically reach a large audience of markets through e-mails and other advertising strategies, since it is fast and economical, irrespective of size or location of business. There are many gender issues, however, related to connectivity and access to available ICTs, some of which are visibly documented and most often examined as the digital divide based on gender. Rakow (1986), in her classic studies on gender and ICTs, however, points out that technology should not be examined based on the differences in the behavior of men or women towards a technology, but instead to look for the ways in which the technology is used to construct us as women and men through the social practices that put it to use. Rakow further argues that more attention needs to be paid to how communication technologies alter, aid, or construct women’s opportunities for interacting with each other and with the wider public domain. This article is based on data gathered through a detailed open-ended questionnaire, with a sample of 121 Jamaican women, ages 21 and older, and explores their access and nature of use of ICTs as well as challenges they face in their attempts to use them effectively. Like other Caribbean islands, Jamaica has embraced ICTs as a tool for national development, adopting the most recent technologies to ensure global connectivity. The study examines how these technologies could be used effectively to address some of the developmental, economical, health and human developmental challenges that face the Small Island Developing States (SIDS). These findings are used to complement existing studies, including national surveys and literature on the gender and ICT issues in the Caribbean.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,1-6,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Muturi, Nancy",Kansas State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1002419482,1,
pub.1039296054,10.1145/1168987.1168988,Technology and older adults:: designing for accessibility and usability,"Two major demographic trends underscore the importance of considering technology adoption by older adults: the aging of the population and rapid dissemination of technology within most societal contexts. In the past decade, developments in computer and information technologies have occurred at an unprecedented rate and technology has become an integral component of work, education, healthcare, communication and entertainment. At the same time that we are witnessing explosive developments in technology the population is aging. In 2003 people aged 65+ yrs. in the United States numbered about 35 million and represented approximately 13% of the population. By 2030 this number is expected to increase to about 71 million representing 20% of the population). Moreover, there will be a dramatic increase in those aged 85+ yrs. increasing in numbers from about 4 million in 2000 to nearly 21 million by 2050. Recent data for the U.S. also indicate that although the use of technology such as computers and the Internet among older adults is increasing there is still an age-based digital divide.Not having access to and being able to use technology may put older adults at a disadvantage in terms of their ability to live independently. For example, the Internet is rapidly becoming a major vehicle for communication and information dissemination about health, community and government services. Technology also offers the potential for enhancing the quality of life of older people by augmenting their ability to perform a variety of tasks and access information. To make technology useful to and usable by older adults a challenge for the research and design community is to ""know thy user"" and better understand the needs, preferences and abilities of older people. It is fairly well established that many technology products and systems are not easily accessible to older people. There are of course a myriad of reasons for this such as cost, lack of access to training programs, etc. However, to a large part it is because designers are unaware of the needs of users with varying abilities or do not know how to accommodate their needs in the design process.Although, older adults today are healthier, more diverse and better educated than previous generations, there are age-related changes in functional abilities that have relevance to the design of technology systems. These include changes in sensory/perceptual processes, motor abilities, response speed, and cognitive processes. The likelihood of developing a disability increases with age, and many older people have at least one chronic condition such as arthritis or hearing and vision impairments. This presentation will discuss the implications of age-related changes in abilities that have relevance to system design and provide a summary of what is currently know about the adoption and use of technology by older people. Recommendations to accommodate these age-related changes in abilities will also be discussed. In addition, a brief discussion of strategies to include the needs of older people in the design process will be presented. It is hoped that this presentation will highlight some important issues and in doing so help bridge the existing age-related digital divide.",Proceedings of the 8th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers and accessibility  - Assets '06,2006,,,1-1,"Czaja, Sara J.",University of Miami,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039296054,8,
pub.1046286284,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch233,The Telehealth Divide,"In the United States, the public is accessing the Internet to provide information and deliver services, and to interact with citizens, business, and other government agencies (Bimber, 1999; Pardo, 2000; West, 2003, 2004). As with any change between citizen-government interactions, e-government is accompanied by speculation on its impact to both citizen and government. E-government capability of continual service delivery can make government efficient and transparent to the public (Norris, 1999; West, 2003), and more responsive to public needs through fast and convenient communication options (Thomas & Streib, 2003). It permits quicker material update than traditional distribution methods (Pardo, 2000). However, other literature suggests e-government will not live up to these prospects. A separation exists among citizens that use and do not use the Internet. This separation is based on a number of factors, including inequalities in Internet access “digital divide” and technological skills, along with psychological and cultural barriers. Literature extensively shows the differences in United States Internet use to fall along important socioeconomic and demographic factors, such as age, race, education, and income (Mossberger, Tolbert, & Stansbury, 2003; Neu, Anderson, & Bikson, 1999; Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2003c; U.S. Department of Commerce, 2002; Wilheim, 2000). E-government may create inequalities in the delivery of government information and services. Telehealth is a specific form of e-government aimed at improving the accessibility and quality of healthcare, and reducing service costs (Schmeida, 2004a). It relies on electronic information and telecommunication technology innovation (H.R. 2157, 2001). As nations contend with expensive healthcare, the promise of better healthcare service delivery at a reduced cost has made teleheath an increasingly attractive policy option in the United States and internationally. Telehealth advancement greatly reflects the dramatic changes in the telecommunication industry. In the 1990s, we witnessed considerable advancement, such as the use of digital technology—interactive video and Internet. Interactive video, for example, can link doctors and medical students afar improving medical education. Rural citizens can interact with specialist(s) through interactive video rather than traveling great distances for a medical consultation. The Internet can bring health related information into the home for better healthcare decision-making. Telehealth can be conceptualized as both an administrative reform policy and regulatory policy. As a hybrid policy type, it mostly exhibits the characteristics of administrative reform, such as e-government (McNeal, Tolbert, Mossberger, & Dotterweich, 2003; Schmeida, McNeal, & Mossberger, 2004) driven by the goals of cost reduction and increasing efficiency, paramount to telehealth adoption and implementation. Administrative reform policy does not involve the direct and coercive use of government power over citizens and are therefore associated with low levels of conflict (Ripley & Franklin, 1980). Regulatory policy, on the other hand tends to be politically salient among citizens as well as controversial among the actors within the policy community. Traditionally, those interests who are regulated have been important players in the policy process. Important telehealth players are physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and health insurers. Since telehealth straddles both administrative and reform policy areas, it is difficult to predict the actors that will play the greatest role in assisting or impeding its implementation. Execution of regulatory policy is highly volatile and controversial with shifting of alliances and players. However, administrative policy innovations are low salience, and as some regulatory policies it involves technical issues, often driven by professional networks and elected officials.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1524-1528,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Schmeida, M.; McNeal, R.",Cleveland Clinic; University of Illinois at Springfield,United States; United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046286284,0,
pub.1050854538,10.4018/978-1-59140-799-7.ch051,E-Commerce in Developing Countries,"Internet access in developing countries is growing rapidly. Developing countries accounted for one-third of Internet users worldwide by the end of 2003, and the catch up rate is getting faster. Between 2000 and 2003, developing countries increased their share of the Internet population of the world by nearly 50%. This has led some commentators, such as World Bank to claim that initiatives to close the digital divide are no longer relevant (Atkins, 2005). However, most residents of these countries still have no access to the Internet. For example, Internet access in Africa is less than two percent in a population of more than 900 million; the lowest rate of access in the world (Dunphy, 2000, UNCTAD 2004). E-commerce, e-government, and mobile commerce provide significant opportunities for developing countries, but their adoption will be slowed by technological, cultural, economic, political, and legal problems (Davis, 1999; Enns & Huff, 1999). Differences in e-readiness and related barriers to e-commerce will sustain substantial differences between regions of the world, between countries within regions, between urban and rural areas within countries, and between the genders and age groups. Different opinions exist as to what benefits the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) can offer developing countries. Do they provide developing countries with the opportunity to “leapfrog” ahead, skipping over certain stages of infrastructure development? Or do ICTs simply widen the gulf between the developed and the developing world even further (Economist, 2005)? The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) views ICTs as enabling technologies that can improve the quality of life for citizens of developing countries. Whereas Bill Gates view is that ICTs can provide little benefit to developing countries until more basic needs like clean water, health, and education have been met. In spite of this lack of agreement the reality is that if a basic communications infrastructure is available, options do exist to utilize e-commerce in developing countries. This article explores the potential opportunities that these technologies offer, and considers the barriers to uptake. E-commerce involves buying and selling goods and services within an electronic marketplace, and also servicing customers, collaborating with business partners, and conducting electronic transactions within an organization (Turban, McLean, & Wetherbe, 2004). E-commerce can take place between one business and another (Business-to-business), and between a business and its customers (business-to-consumer). E-government is the application of e-commerce technologies to the public sector. Developments in e-government have opened up the potential for governments worldwide to improve the services they offer to their citizens. A move towards e-government offers particular advantages to developing countries that may have difficulties interacting with their citizens through more traditional communication channels. E-government consists of two separate areas. First, it is concerned with changing internal government operations, inasmuch as information technology is used to support cooperation among government agencies (government-to-government). Second, it is used to support external government operations, in particular the interactions between citizens and companies, and the public sector, on a self-service basis (government-to-citizen) (Howle, 2003). Mobile commerce offers the potential to bypass inadequate landline telecommunications infrastructure. Growth in the number of mobile telephone users worldwide has expanded from 50 million in 1998 to over 1.3 billion by 2004 (Turban et al., 2004). Wireless technologies have taken off even in relatively low-income areas of the world, where prepaid cards allow access without having to pass a creditworthiness check. At the end of 2003, Africa had more than 50 million mobile device users, whilst the number of fixed line telephone subscribers stood at only 25.1 million (ITU, 2004). Similar trends have been observed in Latin America and Asia, where handheld devices enable users to overcome the difficulties caused by low fixed line penetrations.","Encyclopedia of E-Commerce, E-Government, and Mobile Commerce",2006,,,308-313,"Khosrow-Pour, Mehdi; Toland, Janet",Victoria University of Wellington,New Zealand,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050854538,1,
pub.1039499574,10.4018/978-1-59140-815-4.ch024,The Cross-Cultural Dimension of Gender and Information Technology,"The underrepresentation of women in the information technology (IT) sector has been widely studied in the contexts of western countries such as North American and Western European countries. These studies indicate that the underrepresentation of women in the IT sector is unveiled in multiple perspectives, including IT access, the development, adoption and use of IT, IT education, and the IT workforce in general and within the IT workforce structure itself (e.g., different levels of IT positions) (Cooper & Weaver, 2003; Gürer & Camp, 2002; Hartzel, 2003; Klein, Jiang & Tesch, 2002; Margolis & Fisher, 2002; Rommes, 2002; Trauth, 2002; von Hellens, Neilsen, & Beekhuyzen, 2001; Webster, 1996). Why is it important to study issues related to gender and information technology? First, it is argued that the information technology sector should value and leverage all kinds of diversity (including gender diversity as one dimension) to enhance productivity, to facilitate IT innovation, and to develop IT for a wide variety of people (Avgerou, 2002; Roberts, 2003; Trauth, Huang, Morgan, Quesenberry, & Yeo, 2006). Second, it is also argued that women’s underrepresentation in and exclusion from information technology can be attributed to power and socio-cultural reproduction of inequality through technology development and use, and the historically social-construction of technology fields as “masculine” domains, which result in a gendered digital divide (Cockburn, 1985; Kvasny & Trauth, 2002; Kvasny & Truex, 2001; Wajcman, 1991, 2004; Woodfield, 2000). Ignorance or failure to address issues related to gender and IT will further marginalize women’s participation in future economic and social development, and will endanger social equality and social welfare in general (Kvasny & Trauth, 2002). A significant trend of the contemporary information technology industry is towards globalization, which is manifested through a variety of established practices such as IT offshore outsourcing, global software development, and innovation through global R&D (research & design) collaboration (Sahay, Nicholson, & Krishna, 2003; Walsham, 2000, 2001, 2002). Such a globalization trend of the IT industry and market has put forward new challenges to gender and IT research, to incorporate the cross-cultural dimension. Similar to the rationale for studying gender and IT in developed countries (leveraging diversity and improving social inclusion), Hafkin and Taggart (2001) argued that it is imperative to examine the cultural factors while studying gender and IT in developing countries. Although the research on the cross-cultural dimension of gender relations with information technology is limited, Galpin (2002) pointed out that the underrepresentation of women in IT seems to be a worldwide phenomenon indicated by statistics. Galpin (2002) also pointed out that there is a wide range of participation in IT by women, which is influenced by complex cultural and societal factors that are different from country to country. Models related to gender relations to IT developed in certain socio-cultural contexts may not be applicable to others (Clarke & Teague, 1994a; El Louadi & Everard, 2005; Mukhopadhyay, 1996, 2004). In addition to the importance of studying gender and IT within a specific cultural context, there is another perspective of the cross-cultural dimension of gender and IT: the increasingly diversified global IT workforce as a result of the IT skill shortage, global IT outsourcing, and other global IT collaborations. For example, under the pressure of the skill shortage of the IT workforce in America, the IT institutions and industry turn to the global intellectual pool for recruiting talented international students and skilled IT workers through F-1 and H1-B visas (National Research Council, 2001). According to the 2005 ITAA (Information Technology Association of America) report, the representation of Asian IT workers in the IT workforce doubled the number of Asian worker in the overall workforce in America (ITAA, 2005). Globally, an increasing number of countries have a maturing IT sector, which enables them to enter the global IT outsourcing market or to engage in globally distributed collaborative software work through virtual environment (Trauth et al., 2005). The mobility and cultural diversity of the global IT workforce will add more complexity to articulate their gender relations to IT since individuals may have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. Therefore, it is important for scholars and practitioners to explore the cross-cultural dimension of gender and IT to understand how the nuances of different cultural influences shape women’s relations with IT, to build knowledge with respect to the plural perspective of gender and IT research, and to prepare future global IT workforce. In this article, I first articulate the theoretical underpinnings of cross-cultural dimension of gender and IT research, then review some current studies related to this research area, and finally discuss some future research agendas.",Encyclopedia of Gender and Information Technology,2006,,,147-153,"Trauth, Eileen M.; Huang, Haiyan",Pennsylvania State University,United States,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1039499574,0,
pub.1014258594,10.4018/978-1-59140-789-8.ch220,Role of ICT in Establishing E-Government System for Disadvantaged Communities,"Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are playing an increasingly vital role in the daily lives of all communities by revolutionizing their working procedures and rules of governance. ICTs offer a unique opportunity for governing elite to overcome the crisis of representative democracy, as ICT and the Internet empower civil society to play its role more effectively and facilitate the performance of governments’ main function-serving the people who elect them (Misnikov, 2003). In the realm of government, ICT applications are promising to enhance the delivery of public goods and services to common people not only by improving the process and management of government, but also by redefining the age-old traditional concepts. Community networking groups and local government authorities are well placed to campaign for greater inclusion for all members of the community in the information society. Possible areas to target include the provision of technology at low or no cost to groups through community technology centres or out of hours school access. There are many possibilities and local government must take a significant role in these activities (Young, 2000). Information society is based on the effective use and easy access of information and knowledge, while ICT for development (or ICTD) is not restricted to technology itself but focusing on manifold development and diverse manifestations for the people to improve their well-being. ICTD has deep roots in governance, is part of governance and has effects on governance patters and practices at both central and local level. By recognizing these facts, UNDP focuses on technologies to end poverty at WSIS Cyber Summit 2003, and emphasizes on ways that new technologies can help lift more than one billion people out of extreme poverty (UNDP, 2003). Apart from the four Asian IT giants (Korea, Rep., Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, China, and Japan), most of the Asian countries have fallen under the “low access” category of the Digital Access Index. This has also been referred in the WSIS Cyber Summit 2003, until now, limited infrastructure has often been regarded as the main barrier to bridging the digital divide (ITU, 2003). Among the countries with ICT spending as share of their GDP, Sweden, UK, The Netherlands, Denmark, and France (8.63, 7.97, 7.39, 7.19, and 6.57% respectively during 1992-2001) remain at the top (Daveri, 2002, p. 9), while countries like Bangladesh, Greece, Mexico, Niger, and many more remain at the bottom (EC, 2001; ITU, 2003b; Miller, 2001; Piatkowski, 2002). In a similar research it has been found that in terms of average share of ICT spending GDP, New Zealand, Sweden, Australia, USA, and UK (9.3, 8.4, 8.1, 8.1, and 7.8% respectively during 1992-1999) were among the highest (Pohjola, 2002, p. 7), though most of the countries in the Asian and African regions remain below the average of 5%. The disadvantaged communities in the countries staying below average in ICT spending seem to be lagging in forming appropriate information-based economy and eventually fall behind in achieving proper e-government system. The e-government system in those countries need to enhance access to and delivery of government services to benefit people, help strengthen government’s drive toward effective governance and increased transparency, and better management of the country’s social and economic resources for development. The key to e-government is the establishment of a long-term dynamic strategy to fulfill the citizen needs by transforming internal operations. E-government should result in the efficiency and swift delivery and services to citizens, business, government employees and agencies. For citizens and businesses, e-government seems the simplification of procedures and streamlining of different approval processes, while for government employees and agencies, it means the facilitation of cross-agency coordination and collaboration to ensure appropriate and timely decision-making. Thus, e-government demands transformation of government procedures and redefining the process of working with people and activities relating to people. The outcome would be a societal, organizational, and technological change for the government and to its people, with IT as an enabling factor. E-government should concentrate on more efficient delivery of public services, better management of financial, human and public resources and goods at all levels of government, in particular at local level, under conditions of sustainability, participation, interoperability, increased effectiveness and transparency (EU, 2002). ICT brings pertinent sides more closely by prioritizing partnerships between the state, business and civil society. A few East European countries have became economically liberal with the high level of foreign direct investment per capita and at the same time became ICT-advanced regional leaders in terms of economic reform. These countries also present the region’s most vivid examples of partnerships and collaboration. They have clearly manifested the importance of the public-private partnerships, transparent bottom-up strategies, involvement of all stakeholders, total governmental support, capturing economic opportunities, and enabling electronic mediated businesses, responding to the challenges of globalization.",Encyclopedia of Digital Government,2007,,,1436-1444,"Anttiroiko, Ari-Veikko; Malkia, Matti; Rahman, H.",,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1014258594,0,

The emergence of personalized homepage services, e.g. personalized Google Homepage and Microsoft Windows Live, has enabled Web users to select Web contents of interest and to aggregate them in a single Web page. The web contents are often predefined content blocks provided by the service providers. However, it involves intensive manual efforts to define the content blocks and maintain the information in it. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized homepage system, called .Homepage Live., to allow end users to use drag-and-drop actions to collect their favorite Web content blocks from existing Web pages and organize them in a single page. Moreover, Homepage Live automatically traces the changes of blocks with the evolvement of the container pages by measuring the tree edit distance of the selected blocks. By exploiting the immutable elements of Web pages, the tracing algorithm performance is significantly improved. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. expand Open user profiles for adaptive news systems: help or harm?

Over the last five years, a range of projects have focused on progressively more elaborated techniques for adaptive news delivery. However, the adaptation process in these systems has become more complicated and thus less transparent to the users. In this paper, we concentrate on the application of open user models in adding transparency and controllability to adaptive news systems. We present a personalized news system, YourNews, which allows users to view and edit their interest profiles, and report a user study on the system. Our results confirm that users prefer transparency and control in their systems, and generate more trust to such systems. However, similar to previous studies, our study demonstrate that this ability to edit user profiles may also harm the system.s performance and has to be used with caution. expand Investigating behavioral variability in web search Ryen W.

Understanding the extent to which people's search behaviors differ in terms of the interaction flow and information targeted is important in designing interfaces to help World Wide Web users search more effectively. In this paper we describe a longitudinal log-based study that investigated variability in people.s interaction behavior when engaged in search-related activities on the Web.allWe analyze the search interactions of more than two thousand volunteer users over a five-month period, with the aim of characterizing differences in their interaction styles.allThe findings of our study suggest that there are dramatic differences in variability in key aspects of the interaction within and between users, and within and between the search queries they submit.allOur findings also suggest two classes of extreme user. navigators and explorers. whose search interaction is highly consistent or highly variable. Lessons learned from these users can inform the design of tools to support effective Web-search interactions for everyone. expand SESSION: Smarter browsing Csurf: a context-driven non-visual web-browser Jalal U.

Web sites are designed for graphical mode of interaction. Sighted users can ""cut to the chase"" and quickly identify relevant information in Web pages. On the contrary, individuals with visual disabilities have to use screen-readers tobrowse the Web. As screen-readers process pages sequentially and read through everything, Web browsing can become strenuous and time-consuming. Although, the use ofshortcuts and searching offers some improvements, the problem still remains. In this paper, we address the problemof information overload in non-visual Web access using thenotion of context. Our prototype system, CSurf, embodyingour approach, provides the usual features of a screen-reader.However, when a user follows a link, CSurf captures thecontext of the link using a simple topic-boundary detectiontechnique, and uses it to identify relevant information on...",Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '07,2007,,,71-80,"Gatterbauer, Wolfgang; Bohunsky, Paul; Herzog, Marcus; Krüpl, Bernhard; Pollak, Bernhard",TU Wien,Austria,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1005629363,153,"[Krüpl, Bernhard; Herzog, Marcus; Gatterbauer, Wolfgang]|[ur.07701412261.53; ur.014436411373.67; ur.01364730334.55]|Special interest tracks and posters of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '05|2005|||1000-1001|10.1145/1062745.1062838|pub.1009571556|32;[Yang, Yingchen; Luk, Wo-Shun]|[; ur.0726650606.68]|Proceedings of the fourth international workshop on Web information and data management  - WIDM '02|2002|||36-42|10.1145/584931.584940|pub.1013173579|30;[Culotta, Aron; McCallum, Andrew; Betz, Jonathan]|[ur.016024514341.70; ur.01001546740.39; ur.014722000133.32]|Proceedings of the main conference on Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics  -|2006|||296-303|10.3115/1220835.1220873|pub.1014531239|108;[Simon, Kai; Lausen, Georg]|[ur.015337170151.32; ur.07726727015.55]|Proceedings of the 14th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management  - CIKM '05|2005|||381-388|10.1145/1099554.1099672|pub.1015486151|131;[Zhai, Yanhong; Liu, Bing]|[ur.015441534327.25; ur.016133206343.26]|Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '05|2005|||76-85|10.1145/1060745.1060761|pub.1017514996|313;[Aumann, Yonatan; Feldman, Ronen; Liberzon, Yair; Rosenfeld, Benjamin; Schler, Jonathan]|[ur.015202435666.27; ur.015256772047.01; ur.012454166207.11; ur.016522452753.07; ur.013751300161.42]|Knowledge and Information Systems|2006|10|1|1-15|10.1007/s10115-006-0014-x|pub.1019624294|19;[Lerman, Kristina; Getoor, Lise; Minton, Steven; Knoblock, Craig]|[ur.0655606300.19; ur.010710276421.60; ur.01274716314.87; ur.01134133120.09]|Proceedings of the 2004 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  - SIGMOD '04|2004|||119-130|10.1145/1007568.1007584|pub.1020248508|85;[Embley, David W.; Lopresti, Daniel; Nagy, George]|[ur.010007522541.11; ur.012733477231.90; ur.013711502063.77]|Lecture Notes in Computer Science|2006|3872||164-175|10.1007/11669487_15|pub.1020342722|26;[Pivk, A.; Cimiano, P.; Sure, Y.]|[ur.013000233027.70; ur.015546222053.43; ur.015165341155.18]|Journal of Web Semantics|2005|3|2-3|132-146|10.1016/j.websem.2005.06.003|pub.1020843849|12;[Wang, Yalin; Hu, Jianying]|[ur.010726510417.13; ur.01103646175.49]|Proceedings of the eleventh international conference on World Wide Web  - WWW '02|2002|||242-250|10.1145/511446.511478|pub.1021626234|122;[Parsia, Bijan; Patel-Schneider, Peter F.]|[ur.011355175742.58; ur.016676426740.37]|Proceedings of the 13th international World Wide Web conference on Alternate track papers & posters  - WWW Alt.
