"Buchi M, 2016",MODELING THE SECOND-LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE: A FIVE-COUNTRY STUDY OF SOCIAL DIFFERENCES IN INTERNET USE,1,4.0573656169723336,0.6302996042962126,"BASED ON REPRESENTATIVE SURVEYS ON INTERNET USE, THIS ARTICLE ADVANCES COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON THE SECOND-LEVEL DIGITAL DIVIDE BY MODELING INTERNET USAGE DISPARITIES FOR FIVE COUNTRIES WITH NARROWING ACCESS GAPS. FOUR CORE INTERNET USAGE TYPES ARE CONSTRUCTED AND PREDICTED BY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES IN A STRUCTURAL MODEL. OVERALL, THE FINDINGS CONFIRM THE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED SHIFT IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FROM ACCESS TO USAGE IN FIVE FURTHER COUNTRIES. RESULTS SHOW THAT SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS ALONE ACCOUNT FOR UP TO HALF OF THE VARIANCE IN USAGE IN THESE HIGH-PENETRATION COUNTRIES, WITH AGE BEING THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR. MEASUREMENT INVARIANCE TESTS INDICATE THAT A DIRECT COMPARISON IS ONLY VALID BETWEEN THREE OF THE FIVE COUNTRIES EXPLORED. METHODOLOGICALLY, THIS POINTS TO THE INDISPENSABILITY OF SUCH TESTS FOR UNBIASED COMPARATIVE RESEARCH."

MAKING USE OF QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEYS WITH REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES, THE IMPORTANCE OF GENERATIONAL BELONGINGS IN STRUCTURING DIFFERENT TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEDIA IS DEMONSTRATED, AS YOUNGSTERS SEEM TO PREFER NEW MEDIA. HOWEVER, THIS VARIABLE DOES NOT HOLD IN ITSELF COMPLETE EXPLANATORY POWER. THE IMPORTANCE OF FORMAL EDUCATION, BESIDES OTHER SOCIOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, IS CLEAR, INDICATING THE EXISTENCE OF SOCIAL DISPARITIES WITHIN AGE COHORTS, WITH REPERCUSSIONS ON THE MEDIATED ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES. THE DIVERSITY AND INEQUALITIES FOUND THROUGH THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS HELP TO COMBAT THE RHETORIC OF A SUPPOSEDLY INNATE, ALL-ENCOMPASSING DIGITAL NATIVITY. BY ADOPTING A SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH, WITH A MORE HOLISTIC SCOPE, THIS ARTICLE ALSO AIMS TO RECONSTRUCT PART OF THE COMPLEXITY AND MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AND WITHIN PORTUGUESE GENERATIONS WITH MEDIA, THEREBY DECONSTRUCTING MORE ESSENTIALIST AND HOMOGENISING NOTIONS OF YOUTH AND GENERATIONS."

WE EXTEND THIS RESEARCH TO ANALYSE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE OUTCOMES OF INTERNET USE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE APPLY STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING TO DATA FROM A LARGE INTERNET SURVEY TO COMPARE THE SOCIAL STRUCTURATION OF INTERNET BENEFITS WITH HARMS. WE FIND THAT HIGHLY EDUCATED USERS BENEFIT MOST FROM USING THE WEB. ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS BENEFIT MORE THAN YOUNGER ONES. NEXT TO DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, TECHNOLOGY ATTITUDES ARE THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF ONLINE BENEFITS. THE HARMS FROM USING THE INTERNET ARE STRUCTURED DIFFERENTLY, WITH EDUCATED USERS AND THOSE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF PRIVACY CONCERNS BEING MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO HARM. THIS RUNS COUNTER TO INTUITIONS BASED ON PRIOR DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH, WHERE THOSE AT THE MARGINS SHOULD BE MOST AT RISK. WHILE PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON DIGITAL INEQUALITY HAS ONLY LOOKED AT BENEFITS, THE INCLUSION OF HARMS DRAWS A MORE DIFFERENTIATED PICTURE."

THE CENTRAL RESEARCH QUESTION OF THE WORK AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER, WHEN COMPARED WITH A HIGHER LEVEL OF DISSEMINATION OF TECHNOLOGY OVER TIME, THE ADOPTION CURVES TRACE A MODEL OF PROGRESSIVE INCLUSION FOR THE ""POOR"" WHICH APPROACH THE ""RICHEST"", OR WHETHER PROGRESSIVE INCREASES ARE RECORDED IN GAPS. CONSIDERING A TIME SPAN OF MORE THAN A DECADE, MICRODATA FROM THE ISTAT MULTIPURPOSE ""ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE"" SURVEY WERE USED TO FIND AN EMPIRICALLY GROUNDED ANSWER TO THIS RESEARCH QUESTION. IN TERMS OF METHODOLOGY, INDICES OF ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE DIGITAL EXCLUSION AND MARGINALISATION WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE PHENOMENON WERE PROPOSED AND USED. TECHNIQUES OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS (CLUSTER ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE FACTOR ANALYSIS) WERE ALSO APPLIED TO DETECT ANY CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF VARIABLES AND TRAJECTORIES OF THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS IN QUESTION.

DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO AND USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICTS) IN HOUSEHOLDS AND BY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN USING THE FOLLOWING METHODOLOGY: 1) FACTOR ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THE KEY VARIABLES OF USE OF AND ACCESS TO ICTS IN HOUSEHOLDS AND BY INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPEAN REGIONS ON THE BASIS OF DATA PROVIDED BY EUROSTAT; 2) CONSTRUCTION OF A SYNTHETIC INDEX, THE HOUSEHOLD AND INDIVIDUAL DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT INDEX (HIDDI) ON THE BASIS OF IDENTIFIED FACTORS; 3) ANALYSIS OF THE SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT TO IDENTIFY, DELIMIT AND QUANTIFY SPATIAL PATTERNS AND CLUSTERS IN EUROPEAN REGIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS IN EUROPEAN REGIONS IS FOUNDED ON BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE LEVEL OF DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE DD OF EUROPEAN REGIONS IS BASED ON HOUSEHOLDS AND INDIVIDUALS' DAILY USE OF E-COMMERCE, E-BANKING AND E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE USE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IN HOUSEHOLDS WITH BROADBAND SHOWS LESS DD IN EUROPE. THE VALUES OBTAINED BY USING THE HIDDI FOR EACH EUROPEAN REGION REVEAL THAT THE MAXIMUM DD BETWEEN THESE IS 37%, WITH THE SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION ANALYSIS IDENTIFYING A NW-SE PATTERN IN EUROPE.

OUR ESTIMATION RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE IS A STRONG SPATIAL INTERDEPENDENCE AMONG SSA, IMPLYING THAT INTERNET ACCESS AND BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS IN ONE COUNTRY ARE AFFECTED BY INTERNET ACCESS AND BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, MOST LIKELY DUE TO SPILLOVER EFFECTS. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT GDP PER CAPITA, GROSS CAPITAL FORMATION, POLITICAL STABILITY, REGULATORY EFFICACY AND ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE DIRECTLY AFFECT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. MOREOVER, GDP PER CAPITA, POPULATION GROWTH, GOVERNMENT CONSUMPTION, TRADE OPENNESS, AND ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO INDIRECTLY AFFECT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THROUGH SPILLOVER EFFECTS.

THE RESULTS FROM MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF SURVEY DATA FROM A NATION-WIDE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE SHOW THAT WHEN COMPARING EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND SOCIALIZING NETWORKS, ONLY THE LATTER IS ASSOCIATED WITH PROXY INTERNET USE: INTERNET NON-USERS WHO HAVE (GRAND-)CHILDREN IN THEIR SOCIALIZING SUPPORT NETWORK ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN PROXY INTERNET USE. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT NON-USERS WHO ARE YOUNGER, MORE EDUCATED, HAVE CHILDREN, AND LIVE IN URBAN AREAS ARE MORE INCLINED TO ENGAGE IN PROXY INTERNET USE, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF SOCIAL SUPPORT.

BY EXTENDING BASIC PHYSICAL ACCESS COMBINED WITH MATERIAL ACCESS, THE STUDY FINDS THAT A DIVERSITY IN ACCESS TO DEVICES AND PERIPHERALS, DEVICE-RELATED OPPORTUNITIES, AND THE ONGOING EXPENSES REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS AFFECT EXISTING INEQUALITIES RELATED TO INTERNET SKILLS, USES, AND OUTCOMES."

THE IMPACT OF COMPUTER AND INTERNET ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES ON INTERNET USE IN THAILAND,3,5.731475084885093,0.8490672696438666,"WE EXAMINE THE FIRST DIGITAL DIVIDE IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, THAILAND, EXPLORING HOW RESOURCES AND APPROPRIATION THEORY CONCEPTS EXPLAIN INTERNET USE DIVERSITY. WE FIND THAT COMPUTER AND INTERNET ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF INTERNET USE AND ALSO THAT THEIR EFFECT DEPENDS ON INDIVIDUALS' RESOURCES AND SOCIAL CATEGORIES (PARTICULARLY GENDER, AGE, AND EDUCATION), RESULTING IN MOBILE AND TRADITIONAL USER CLASSES (YOUNGER, BETTER EDUCATED, URBAN WOMEN, AND OLDER, LESS WELL-EDUCATED, MARRIED, NON-URBAN INDIVIDUALS, RESPECTIVELY). DRIVERS BEHIND INTERNET USE DIVERSITY MAY BE GENERATIONAL, SUGGESTING A NEED TO SWITCH THE RESEARCH FOCUS FROM HOUSEHOLDS TO INDIVIDUALS, EVEN IN LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES."

WE MEASURE THE THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTS OF THE MODEL WITH DATA PROVIDED BY THE EU AND TEST THE THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS USING A PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL. WE FIND SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIZED RELATIONSHIPS BUT FIND THAT THE EFFECTS VARY DEPENDING ON THE DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT LEVEL OF COUNTRIES. WHILE EDUCATION OVERALL IS THE PRIMARY DETERMINANT OF THE SOCIAL PRODUCTION OF DIGITAL INEQUALITIES, A COUNTRY'S DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT LEVEL IS CRUCIAL FOR LESS WELL-EDUCATED EUROPEANS. THESE FINDINGS HAVE THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: (1) THEY CALL INTO QUESTION THE HOMOGENEITY OF THE EFFECT OF CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT INDIVIDUALS DIFFER ONLY IN TERMS OF MOTIVATION, ACCESS, AND DIGITAL SKILLS, AND (2) THEY INDICATE THAT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED EUROPEANS BENEFIT FROM LIVING IN MORE DIGITALLY DEVELOPED COUNTRIES."

EXPLOITING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE ONGOING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN ALL SPHERES OF LIFE-A PROCLAIMED GOAL OF GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS-REQUIRES ENSURING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORTING DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR INTERNET USE. USING REPRESENTATIVE, POPULATION-LEVEL SURVEY DATA FROM SWITZERLAND SPANNING NEARLY A DECADE (2011-2019; N-TOTAL = 5,581), MULTIPLE MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSES TESTED THE EFFECTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND INTERNET-USE RELATED VARIABLES ON ACCESS (GENERAL AND MOBILE), ON INTERNET SKILLS AND ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF USE (INFORMATION, ENTERTAINMENT, COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS AND COMMUNICATION). RESULTS INDICATED THAT DESPITE HIGH ACCESS RATES (92% IN 2019), CONSIDERABLE USAGE INEQUALITIES PERSIST IN THE SWISS INFORMATION SOCIETY: IN PARTICULAR, WE FOUND AN INCREASING MARGINALIZATION OF OLDER INDIVIDUALS REGARDING THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERNET AND REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNET SKILLS, EXPERIENCE AND MOBILE INTERNET USE FOR ADOPTING DIFFERENTIATED TYPES OF USE. THE EXTREME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HIGHLY CONNECTED MAJORITY AND AN INCREASINGLY MARGINALIZED MINORITY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LATTER GROUP'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN AN INFORMATION SOCIETY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES UNIQUE RESULTS ON CURRENT DIGITAL INEQUALITIES AND THEIR EVOLUTION WHICH ARE CRUCIAL FOR ASSESSING THE SUCCESS, SUITABILITY AND LEGITIMACY OF DIGITIZATION POLICIES."

NEW CHALLENGES FOR USERS ARISE FROM INCREASED AMOUNT OF DATA, DECISIONS MADE AUTOMATICALLY, LESS VISIBILITY AND MORE AMBIGUITY, AND MAGNIFIED SECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS. THERE IS A FAIR CHANCE THAT ONLY A SELECTIVE GROUP WILL BENEFIT,MAKING IT IMPORTANT TO STUDY IOT FROM A DIGITAL INEQUALITY PERSPECTIVE. THE CURRENT STUDY FOCUSED ON HEALTH, HOME, AND SECURITY RELATED IOT BY CONDUCTING A SURVEY AMONG A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE DUTCH POPULATION. THE STUDY WAS GUIDED BY RESOURCES AND APPROPRIATION THEORY. IOT ATTITUDES AND MATERIAL ACCESS AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL AND INCOME DIFFERENCES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE. THOSE WITH HIGHER EDUCATION AND THOSE WITH HIGHER INCOMES HAVE MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDES AND ARE THE FIRST TO ACTUALLY BUY IOT. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THEY ARE THE FIRST TO DEVELOP THE REQUIRED SKILLS AND TO ENGAGE IN A DIVERSE IOT USE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TO MAKE THE IOT ATTRACTIVE FOR LARGER PARTS OF THE POPULATION, CLEAR TERMS OF USE AND USER-FRIENDLY IOT SHOULD BE AN IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE. STIMULATING POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS IOT WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF IOT OWNERSHIP, DEVELOPMENT OF IOT SKILLS, AND, EVENTUALLY, A WIDER DIVERSITY OF IOT USE. POLICIES SHOULD AIM TO STRESS THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES IOT HAS TO OFFER AND SHOULD PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE OF HOW PERSONAL DATA IS USED AS WELL AS BETTER PRIVACY, SECURITY PRACTICES AND REGULATION."

PROXY INTERNET USE (PIU), WHERE NONUSERS ASK INTERNET USERS TO DO THINGS ONLINE FOR THEM, HELPS NONUSERS MITIGATE THEIR EXCLUSION FROM THE DIGITAL REALM. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE CHANGING FACTORS THAT SHAPE PIU ACTIVATION. SPECIFICALLY, IT FOCUSES ON THE CHANGING ROLE OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS AND FAMILY SUPPORT IN INTERNET NONUSERS' ACCESS TO ONLINE SERVICES BY COMPARING FACTORS ENGENDERING ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT IN PIU IN 2009 AND 2018. THE RESULTS FROM MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA FROM TWO NATIONWIDE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES COLLECTED NINE YEARS APART IN SLOVENIA SHOW THAT BOTH SETS OF FACTORS HAVE LOST THEIR EXPLANATORY POWER OVER TIME. AT THE SAME TIME, INTERNET NONUSERS ARE INCREASINGLY CONCENTRATED IN THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS OF PEOPLE. SPECIFICALLY, THE DECREASING IMPORTANCE OF (GRAND)CHILDREN AS PROXY USERS AND THE NEWLY EMERGING IMPORTANCE OF SPOUSES OR PARTNERS REPRESENTS A SHIFT AWAY FROM INTERGENERATIONAL SUPPORT AND TOWARD INTRAGENERATIONAL SUPPORT IN REGARDS TO WHO NONUSERS RELY ON WHEN ASKING FOR HELP WITH ONLINE TASKS AND SERVICES."
