THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN OVERCOMING SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN US EDUCATION,1,0,0.6209150326797386,"THE USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION IS NOW A POLITICAL ORTHODOXY SEEN BY MANY POLITICIANS AND EDUCATORS AS A READY MEANS OF WIDENING PARTICIPATION TO THOSE SOCIAL GROUPS TRADITIONALLY EXCLUDED FROM LEARNING. HOWEVER THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN OVERCOMING SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN EDUCATION AND LIFETIME LEARNING PRACTICES HAS OFTEN FAILED TO BE OBJECTIVELY DISCUSSED WITH A TENDENCY FOR MANY EDUCATIONALISTS TO ADOPT EITHER OVERTLY OPTIMISTIC OR PESSIMISTIC POSITIONS. FROM THIS BACKGROUND THE PRESENT ARTICLE OBJECTIVELY EXAMINES BOTH CURRENT PATTERNS OF EXCLUSION FROM EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY ALONGSIDE THE RANGE OF ONGOING POLICIES AND INITIATIVES ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES CONCERNED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATION. MOREOVER BASED ON A RANGE OF NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN RESEARCH LITERATURE CONCERNED WITH PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION, THE ARTICLE THEN DISCUSSES THE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS FACED BY U.S. EDUCATIONALISTS AND POLICY MAKERS IN PROACTIVELY USING TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS OF REDUCING SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN LIFELONG EDUCATION."

THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES A CRITICAL DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE FINAL REPORT OF THE DOT FORCE, TOGETHER WITH THICK DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH IT WAS PRODUCED. THE RESOLUTION OF NUMEROUS ANTAGONISMS BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE NARRATIVE OF THE FINAL REPORT REFLECTS THE FIELD OF POWER IN WHICH THE DOT FORCE OPERATES.

TO ANALYSE THIS CONCEPT WE STUDY CAUSES OF PRIVATE COMPUTER AND INTERNET ACCESS WITH A THREE-FOLD MODEL INCLUDING HUMAN CAPITAL, FAMILY CONTEXT AND SOCIAL CONTEXT. THE 1997, 2001, AND 2003 GERMAN SOCIO-ECONOMIC PANEL WAVES CONTAIN DATA ON PRIVATE COMPUTER AND INTERNET USE, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON PAST AND PRESENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. IN 2003, MEMBERSHIP OF TECHNICAL GENERATIONS AND ETHNIC BACKGROUND TO A LARGE EXTENT DETERMINED THE USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. BY ILLUSTRATING THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND FAMILY CONTEXT WE ARE ABLE TO EXPLAIN ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCES FOUND FOR COMPUTER AND INTERNET USE. EFFECTS OF INCOME, GENDER, AND LIVING IN A SINGLE HOUSEHOLD ARE SIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT SOME OF THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THE 40-YEAR GERMAN SEPARATION ARE DIMINISHING WITH REGARD TO COMPUTER USE.

THIS ARTICLE EXTENDS THE MEASUREMENTS ABOVE THE USUAL BIVARIATE COMPARISONS. WITHIN THIS CONTEXT, THREE ESSENTIAL APPROACHES ARE PRESENTED AND CRITICALLY EVALUATED. FIRST, LOGLINEAR MODELING IS USED TO ADDRESS THE INTERACTIONS AMONG THE FACTORS AFFECTING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. SECOND, COMPOUND MEASURES (I.E., THE DIGITAL DIVIDE INDEX) THAT INTEGRATE A NUMBER OF VARIABLES INTO A SINGLE INDICATOR ARE DISCUSSED. THIRD, TIME-DISTANCE METHODOLOGY IS APPLIED TO ANALYZE CHANGES IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE APPROACHES OFTEN YIELD ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS COMPARED TO SIMPLE BIVARIATE ANALYSIS. THE EXAMPLES ARE PRESENTED AS A GENERAL WARNING AGAINST AN OVERSIMPLIFIED METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO DIGITAL DIVIDE STUDIES."

THE DIFFUSION RATE AMONG THE ELDERLY IS INCREASING, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND THE FIGURES OF THE YOUNG USERS. CULTURAL PREPARATIONS AND EASY ACCESS MODES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE ELDERLY, WHO COULD MAKE USE OF LATECOMER ADVANTAGES.

DEMOGRAPHIC, USE AND EXPERTISE VARIABLES ARE ALL SHOWN TO PLAY A ROLE IN ACCOUNTING FOR VARIATIONS IN THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF INTERNET USE."

BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS INVOKED THE NOTION OF A DIGITAL DIVIDE, I.E. A GENERATION GAP BETWEEN THOSE WHO MASTER AND DO NOT MASTER DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY. IT IS ARGUED THAT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WAS EXPLOITED BY THE CHILDREN TO CONTROL THE GAME ACTIVITIES. CONVERSELY, PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS POSITIONED THEMSELVES AS LESS KNOWLEDGEABLE, DRAWING ON A DISPLAYED DIVIDE AS A RHETORICAL RESOURCE FOR GAINING ACCESS TO PLAYTIME WITH THE CHILDREN. IN THESE INTERGENERATIONAL ENCOUNTERS, THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WAS THUS AN INTERACTIONAL RESOURCE RATHER THAN A PROBLEM."

THIS ARTICLE OUTLINES A HOLISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY, WHICH FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL AND SPATIAL DIVISIONS, BY DRAWING ON ECONOMISTS' IDEAS ABOUT THE NEW ECONOMY AND FEMINIST PERSPECTIVES ON SOCIAL REPRODUCTION. THE FRAMEWORK IS ILLUSTRATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE EMERGING NEW MEDIA CLUSTER IN BRIGHTON AND HOVE, WHICH, AS A CONSEQUENCE, EMERGES LESS AS A NEW TECHNOLOGY CLUSTER AND MORE AS A REFLECTION OF INCREASING SOCIAL DIVISIONS IN THE NEW ECONOMY. © 2004 CLARK UNIVERSITY."
"Gil-Garcia J, 2006",IS IT ONLY ABOUT INTERNET ACCESS? AN EMPIRICAL TEST OF A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL DIGITAL DIVIDE,3,32.41031490085463,0.46405228758169936,"SCHOLARS FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES HAVE RECENTLY STUDIED A PHENOMENON CALLED ""THE DIGITAL DIVIDE"". SINCE MANY OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES ARE BASED ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES AND REQUIRE THE USE OF THE INTERNET BY CITIZENS, UNDERSTANDING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE (AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE POTENTIAL DEMAND) IS IMPORTANT FOR E-GOVERNMENT SCHOLARS. FOR SOME RESEARCHERS, THE DIVIDE IS NOT A PROBLEM AND INTERNET ACCESS IS THE ONLY RELEVANT DETERMINANT OF INTERNET USE (ACCESS DIVIDE). FOR OTHER RESEARCHERS, THE DIVIDE IS ROOTED IN MORE FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL DIFFERENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES (MULTI-DIMENSIONAL DIVIDE). USING DATA FROM THE PIEDMONT REGION IN ITALY, THIS PAPER TESTS THESE TWO COMPETING VIEWS OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. OVERALL, THE MODELS BASED ON A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL VIEW HAVE GREATER EXPLANATORY POWER AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE ABOUT THE RELEVANCE OF MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECTING BOTH INTERNET ACCESS AND INTERNET USE. FOR INSTANCE, FEMALES USE THE INTERNET FOR A SMALLER NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES THAN MALES. INDIVIDUALS WITH MORE FORMAL EDUCATION AND WHO CAN SPEAK ENGLISH USE THE INTERNET MORE. FINALLY, INDIVIDUALS WITH MORE EXPERIENCE USING A PC AND THE INTERNET ITSELF ALSO USE THE INTERNET TO PERFORM A BROADER RANGE OF ACTIVITIES."
"Ferro E, 2007",THE DIGITAL DIVIDE METAPHOR: UNDERSTANDING PATHS TO IT LITERACY,3,8.025292150978766,0.4019607843137255,"NOT HAVING ACCESS OR HAVING A DISADVANTAGED ACCESS TO INFORMATION, IN AN INFORMATION-BASED SOCIETY MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A HANDICAP [5]. IN THE LAST TWO DECADES SCHOLARS HAVE GRADUALLY REFINED THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF DIGITAL DIVIDE, MOVING FROM A DICHOTOMOUS MODEL MAINLY BASED ON ACCESS TO A MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODEL ACCOUNTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN USAGE LEVELS AND PERSPECTIVES. WHILE MODELS BECAME MORE COMPLEX, RESEARCH CONTINUED TO MAINLY FOCUS ON DEEPENING THE UNDERSTANDING OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADOPTERS AND NON-ADOPTERS. IN DOING SO, THE PROCESS OF BASIC IT SKILLS ACQUISITION HAS BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A METAPHORICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE PROCESS OF IT SKILLS ACQUISITION DERIVED FROM EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE. THE ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE PRESENCE OF THREE DISTINCT IT SKILLS ACQUISITION APPROACHES, AS WELL AS THE KEY ROLE OF SELF-LEARNING. THESE PRELIMINARY RESULTS REPRESENT A USEFUL STARTING POINT FOR THE DESIGN OF MORE EFFECTIVE AND SOPHISTICATED INCLUSION POLICIES."
