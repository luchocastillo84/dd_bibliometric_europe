USING CANONICAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS, THE DIFFERENCES DETECTED BETWEEN GROUPS OF COUNTRIES BOTH IN TERMS OF ICT PATTERNS AND IN TERMS OF THE FACTORS EXPLAINING EACH ARE COMPARED. THE RESULTS PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF ICT ADOPTION THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED PRIMARILY BY VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN DEVELOPMENT LEVELS. IN COUNTRIES REGISTERING HIGHER LEVELS OF ICT ADOPTION, THE DIGITALIZATION PATTERN IS EXPLAINED BY GDP, SERVICE SECTOR, EDUCATION, AND GOVERNMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS. IN CONTRAST, IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, POPULATION AGE AND URBAN POPULATION ARE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ICT ADOPTION, WHILE INTERNET COSTS IMPACT NEGATIVELY. THE RESULTS MIGHT BE USEFUL IN FINDING AND IMPLEMENTING THE MOST SUITABLE TELECOMMUNICATION AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES FOR EACH CASE. (C) 2009 ELSEVIER LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."

USING DATA FROM THE PROGRAMME FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ASSESSMENT (PISA) 2003 IN 30 NATIONS, WE FOCUS ON SOCIAL CLEAVAGES IN MID-ADOLESCENTS ACCESS AND USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BOTH INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL AND COUNTRY-LEVEL INFLUENCES. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT ADOLESCENTS FROM HIGHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND TWO-PARENT FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME. ADDITIONALLY, ADOLESCENTS FROM HIGHER-STATUS FAMILIES USE THE INTERNET MORE OFTEN FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES THAN CHILDREN FROM LOWER-STATUS FAMILIES. ADOLESCENTS FROM SINGLE-PARENT ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE HOME INTERNET ACCESS. NEVERTHELESS, THEY USE THE INTERNET MORE FREQUENTLY FOR INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION AND PLAY COMPUTER GAMES MORE OFTEN THAN THEIR PEERS LIVING IN TWO-PARENT FAMILIES. TESTING SIMULTANEOUSLY INDIVIDUAL AND COUNTRY CHARACTERISTICS SHOWS THAT A COUNTRYS LEVEL OF MODERNIZATION CAN BE SEPARATED INTO COMPOSITIONAL AND CONTEXTUAL EFFECTS. OVERALL, A COUNTRYS LEVEL OF MODERNIZATION ONLY AFFECTS WHETHER DIGITAL APPLICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE AT THE FAMILY HOME, BUT NOT HOW THEY ARE USED. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ONCE A FAMILY HAS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET, THE DIGITAL USE PATTERNS OF THEIR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN DO NOT DIFFER ACROSS NATIONS."

ELEVEN VARIABLES PROVIDING DATA ON 126 COUNTRIES ARE ANALYZED USING MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY WHICH OF THEM INFLUENCE INTERNET USAGE TO WHAT EXTENT. THE USED DATA ON 126 COUNTRIES REFER TO THE YEAR 2005. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT INCOME INEQUALITY MEASURED BY THE GINI COEFFICIENT IS AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCING FACTOR BESIDES PER CAPITA INCOME, THE DEGREE OF URBANIZATION, AND THE LEVEL OF DEMOCRATIZATION. THE RESULTS QUESTION REDUCTIONISTIC DIGITAL DIVIDE APPROACHES THAT ANALYZE INFORMATION INEQUALITY VIA FOCUSING ON A SINGLE VARIABLE (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY OR MARKETS).

THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE: WHAT FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO EXPLAIN THE E-ACCESS AND THE E-SKILLS? IN WHAT WAY DO SOCIO-ECONOMIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, CULTURAL, AND POLITICAL FACTORS EXPLAIN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE? IN ORDER TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS, TWO STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED: ONE AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND ONE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL. BASED ON DATA COLLECTED FROM 330 LEBANESE POTENTIAL USERS OF PUBLIC E-SERVICES, THE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL STUDY MEASURES THE IMPACTS OF INCOME, EDUCATION LEVEL, AND OCCUPATION DISPARITIES ON THE E-ACCESS AND E-SKILLS DIVIDES. IT ALSO MEASURES THE IMPACTS OF GENDER, RELIGIOUS, REGIONAL, AND GENERATIONAL DIFFERENCES ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THE SECOND STUDY COMPARES 86 COUNTRIES BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS: ECONOMIC (MEASURED BY GDP PER CAPITA), SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC (HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDEX), CULTURAL (DISPARITIES BETWEEN GENDERS), AND POLITICAL (DEMOCRACY INDEX). IN ORDER TO ISOLATE THE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WE ALSO COMPARE THESE RESULTS TO THOSE OF THE ARAB WORLD (21 COUNTRIES). BY COMPARING THE MICRO WITH THE MACRO LEVEL OF ANALYSIS, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NOVEL POINT OF VIEW THAT CAN MEASURE THE INDIVIDUAL IMPACTS ON THE MACRO AND THE MACRO IMPACTS ON THE INDIVIDUAL."

ADDITIONALLY, GENDER WAS INCLUDED IN THE SURVEY AS AN IMPORTANT BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTIC IN DIGITAL DIVIDE RESEARCH. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO MODEL THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE INFLUENCING FACTORS UPON THE ICT-RELATED VARIABLES. WHAT EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSES WAS THAT SES AFFECTS THE COMPUTER-USE PROFILE ONLY MODERATELY. NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SES AND COMPUTER OWNERSHIP WAS FOUND. MOREOVER, THE ACQUISITION OF ICT COMPETENCIES CAN NO LONGER BE ATTRIBUTED TO COMPUTER OWNERSHIP. APART FROM A SMALL EFFECT ON ICT USE (A HIGHER SES TENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ICT USE), SES DOES NOT SEEM TO AFFECT THE COMPUTER-USE PROFILE OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN FLANDERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT THE EXISTING DIFFERENCES IN SES ON COMPUTER-USE PROFILE ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY MARKED TO DEDUCE THAT ICT CAN BE SEEN AS AN INDICATOR OF DIFFERING CULTURAL CAPITAL."

THIS PAPER AIMS AT EXPLORING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES AMONG CHINESE CHILDREN FROM AN EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVE. FOUR SCHOOLS WERE SELECTED, INVOLVING 658 STUDENTS AGED 10-14. NINE HYPOTHESES ON INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS (DIMAGGIO & HARGITTAI, 2001) AND THEIR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES WERE TESTED. THE STUDY FOUND THAT: (1) STUDENTS' INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME IS BETTER THAN THAT AT SCHOOL; (2) COMPARED WITH PARENTS, TEACHERS HAVE MORE POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON STUDENTS' INTERNET BEHAVIOUR; (3) STUDENTS FROM RURAL OR MIGRANT SCHOOLS SCORE LOWER ON ALL THE INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS (DIGITAL ACCESS, AUTONOMY OF USE, SOCIAL SUPPORT, INTERNET USE AND SELF-EFFICACY) AND ARE THEREFORE MORE DISADVANTAGED IN INTERNET USAGE STATUS THAN THEIR URBAN PEERS; (4) THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT GENDER DIFFERENCES; (5) THE MORE EDUCATION PARENTS HAVE RECEIVED, THE BETTER THE CONDITIONS OF THEIR CHILDREN ACCORDING TO THE LISTED INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS; (6) THE DIMENSIONS OF THE INTERNET INEQUALITY INDICATORS (TECHNICAL APPARATUS, AUTONOMY OF USE, AVAILABILITY OF SOCIAL SUPPORT, VARIATION OF USE) ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED TO STUDENTS' INTERNET SELF-EFFICACY: (7) THERE IS HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN STUDENTS' INTERNET SELF-EFFICACY AND THEIR EXPLORING BEHAVIOURS OF INTERNET USE AND THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE.

FROM THIS BASIS, THE CHAPTER PROPOSES A HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK OF DIGITAL EXCLUSION BASED AROUND CONCEPTUAL 'STAGES' OF ICT USE. USING THIS FRAMEWORK, THE ARGUMENT IS MADE THAT POLICYMAKERS, TECHNOLOGISTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION SOCIETY STAKEHOLDERS FACE A CONSIDERABLE CHALLENGE TO MATCH THE SOCIAL AFFORDANCES OF ICTS WITH THE EVERYDAY NEEDS, INTERESTS, AND DESIRES OF INDIVIDUALS. IN THIS SENSE, DIGITAL EXCLUSION CONTINUES TO DEMAND A COMPLEX SET OF POLICY RESPONSES WHICH GO FAR BEYOND SIMPLY INCREASING LEVELS OF HARDWARE PROVISION AND SUPPORT, AND THEN ASSUMING ANY 'GAPS' TO HAVE BEEN 'BRIDGED.'

SECOND, WE LOOKED INTO SEQUENCES OF MULTIPLE INFLUENCES BETWEEN SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES AND DIGITAL SKILLS AND BETWEEN DIGITAL SKILLS AND DPP. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON DIGITAL SKILLS. AT THE SAME TIME, DIGITAL SKILLS HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON DPP."
"Hoffmann C, 2015",CONTENT CREATION ON THE INTERNET: A SOCIAL COGNITIVE PERSPECTIVE ON THE PARTICIPATION DIVIDE,3,0.7569690541355713,0.2602739726027397,"SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES ARE HELD TO IMPACT INTERNET USERS' WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO PRODUCTIVELY USE ONLINE MEDIA. THIS EFFECT CAN CREATE A 'PARTICIPATION DIVIDE' BETWEEN DISTINCT USER GROUPS. RECENTLY, STUDIES HAVE ENHANCED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTICIPATION DIVIDE BY DIFFERENTIATING TYPES OF ONLINE CONTENT CREATION. THEY FOUND THAT SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS MAY ONLY AFFECT SPECIFIC FORMS OF ONLINE PARTICIPATION. WE SUGGEST THAT SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY (SCT) HELPS EXPLAIN WHY AND HOW SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES INFLUENCE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ONLINE PARTICIPATION. BASED ON SCT, WE ANALYZE THE MEDIATING EFFECT OF TWO COGNITIVE CONSTRUCTS, SELF-EFFICACY AND PRIVACY CONCERNS, ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF ONLINE CONTENT CREATION. WE CONDUCT A SURVEY AMONG GERMAN INTERNET USERS AND APPLY STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING TO COMPARE THREE DISTINCT THEORETICAL MODELS. WE FIND THAT CONSIDERING THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE CONSTRUCTS, BASED ON SCT, IMPROVES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES AFFECT WHICH TYPE OF ONLINE CONTENT CREATION - AND WHY."
